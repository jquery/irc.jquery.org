[00:00:20] <Anticom> Cork could you please take a look at the second revision of my fiddle?
[00:01:06] <Anticom> i have no idea, why the textarea get's wrapped twice into the container div and why the toolbar div is placed once inside the the inner container and once outside... very strange
[00:01:56] <Cork> Anticom: what am i looking for?
[00:02:45] <Cork> lemonsparrow: where is the data comming from?
[00:02:48] <Anticom> inspect the textarea. i've added a $container = $('<div>') to my plugin and wraped it arround base.$el which represents the textarea
[00:02:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: data from server
[00:02:58] <Anticom> it's in the base.render() method
[00:03:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: for now I have the DOM copied from firebug for you
[00:03:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and why can't the server just send the html?
[00:04:10] <Anticom> lemonsparrow however you could use $.ajax() to retrieve html/json and use that to replace some nodes using $.html() or $.text() etc
[00:04:23] <Anticom> But i'm totally with Cork there
[00:04:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I agree with 200% but we have  been asked to do this stupid way :(
[00:04:44] <Cork> or $.append if you want to append the html string
[00:04:53] <Anticom> For example that would break everything if your clients would have disabled javascript
[00:05:14] <Anticom> $.appendTo(), $.wrap()... i could do that all day. Just read the docs :P
[00:05:14] <Anticom> ^^
[00:05:18] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so you want to send the data as json with the data as text in it?
[00:05:46] <Cork> then you would have to loop it and have the coresponding html for it
[00:05:49] <Anticom> brb
[00:06:06] <Cork> lemonsparrow: actually the absolutely simplest way to do this would be to use a template library
[00:06:21] <Cork> ?g jquery.jqote2
[00:06:21] <b-ot> Cork: jQote2 ‚Äì Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code ‚Üí http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[00:06:23] <bot-t> Cork, jQote2 ñ Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code - http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[00:06:27] <Cork> something like that ^
[00:07:06] <Cork> then just feed the data to the template build and array of the results and then do $(target).append(array_of_generated_template_data.join(''));
[00:07:29] <Cork> anyway i need to go
[00:08:07] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok thanks :)
[00:08:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork: where you going ?
[00:09:56] <Anticom> re
[00:16:56] <sharpy> hey guys
[00:18:07] <Anticom> Cork http://pastebin.com/9ghbbGrR
[00:18:15] <Anticom> think that should show my problem
[00:18:46] <Anticom> monring sharpy
[00:24:18] <lamerion> anyhow in order to decouple jquery mobile page functionality and form elements, i had to build a custom download. http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ and call the element functions individually.
[00:24:56] <sharpy> i have a question: i am doing some animation with a div i want to set the position from the div to the point where it was moved too. So lets say we have a margin from 600px and i am animatin a negative margin to 400. The tricky thing is that this animation runs after a page reload and the margin is always set to the starting point
[00:25:28] <Anticom> how are you animating it?
[00:27:07] <Anticom> you could either save the original position/margin/padding etc before starting to animate the lement (using .data()) and animate back to what you've saved temporarily or you could just remove the element css (using .css('property', '')) which sould cause the element to "pop back" into it's original state
[00:28:35] <resting> is it possible to download a file through $.get()?
[00:29:04] <Anticom> resting i found the best solution is to append an invisible iframe :)
[00:29:33] <Anticom> sharpy could u pls repost your script to jsfiddle.net and make it a working example so we could play around with it?
[00:30:06] <resting> Anticom: hm‚Ä¶what do you mean?
[00:30:09] <sharpy> i will try if i find the time
[00:30:11] <sharpy> :)
[00:31:07] <Anticom> resting $('body').append(<iframe>).hide().attr('src', '/path/to/script/which/sends/file');
[00:31:54] <Anticom> and i'd probably set a timeout to remove the iframe again to keep your dom clean
[00:32:07] <Anticom> Cork see what i mean?
[00:32:49] <resting> Anticom: i see‚Ä¶will try that..thanks
[00:32:56] <Anticom> cheers
[00:33:29] <Anticom> there might be other ways but that always worked for me
[00:38:13] <Anticom> Okay so the render method defenetly get's called only once for each element: http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/2/
[00:38:25] <Anticom> are there any known bugs using .wrap() ?
[00:38:49] <tw2113> Cork, still around?
[00:40:05] <tw2113> nothing vital if you read this an hour later
[00:42:34] <_jgr> So, indexing a jquery object like $(".something")[i] returns what exactly?
[00:44:56] <Anticom> _jgr since jquery works with collections that would return the element of index 1 of that collection
[00:44:59] <Anticom> iirc
[00:45:14] <Anticom> why don't you try?
[00:45:34] <tw2113> console is your friend
[00:45:39] <_jgr> I have, it's html objects
[00:45:50] <_jgr> answered it myself :)
[00:46:03] <Anticom> tw2113 r u using firebug aswell? it got so damn slow for me since the last update
[00:46:05] <Anticom> am i the only one?
[00:46:20] <fumk> Anticom: nope
[00:46:24] <tw2113> i'm giving an honest go at firefox's native tools
[00:46:49] <Anticom> tw2113 logging isn't just that good with the native one
[00:46:51] <tw2113> and i'm in their alpha browser, so a lot of what i get isn't in stable
[00:47:00] <Anticom> at least they unified their tools into (mainly) one window now
[00:47:04] <Anticom> was such a pain before
[00:47:22] <tw2113> once they put in network monitor, i was like "it's time"
[00:47:25] <Anticom> anyways. Anyone expirienced problems with .wrap() before?
[00:47:32] <Anticom> i just don't get what's happening there :(
[00:48:16] <Anticom> tw2113 there's still a lot to do for the mozilla guys to keep up with firebug :p
[00:49:20] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/3YDGmeVG I'm getting some weird results here
[00:49:35] <Anticom> anyone able to help?
[00:51:18] <resting> Anticom: iframe works..but i can't access it cause its a different session i think
[00:51:49] <Anticom> resting you mean the server like rejects your session?
[00:52:42] <Anticom> resting just found this http://stackoverflow.com/a/9970672/966530
[00:55:00] <resting> Anticom: ya i found that too‚Ä¶just unwillingly to just another library for that..
[00:55:20] <Anticom> hmkay
[00:55:54] <Anticom> resting well, if my iframe workaround doesn't work i have no idea, how to achieve that using $.get, $.post or $.ajax
[00:56:45] <resting> Anticom: i see..thanks anyway..
[00:57:30] <Anticom> sorry mate :/ good luck tho
[00:58:26] <Anticom> resting http://stackoverflow.com/a/12496421/966530
[01:02:33] <Cork> Anticom: body don't have src so that line does'
[01:02:41] <Cork> *'t really make sense
[01:02:44] <Anticom> .__________.
[01:02:50] <Anticom> i found my error
[01:03:11] <Anticom> haha i've copied the whole jsfiddle stuff back to my lib script and pasted the $(document).ready() stuff with it ._.
[01:03:20] * Anticom facepalms
[01:03:24] <Cork> :)
[01:04:26] <Anticom> how do i prevent the double initialisation the most efficient way?
[01:04:36] <Anticom> using .data('tokenEditor') ?
[01:05:34] <Cork> ya, that sounds like a good solution
[01:05:39] <Anticom> okay :)
[01:05:44] <Anticom> but the toolbar just won't fade in: http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/3/
[01:05:55] <Anticom> what's different than in your example?
[01:07:16] <Anticom> oops, forgott about the comments removed them: http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/4/
[01:44:45] <Anticom> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/6/
[01:45:03] <Anticom> i just don't get this mouseenter/mouseleave stuff working >.<
[01:46:00] <Anticom> seems i can't bind the events, but why?
[01:46:13] <Anticom> i'm binding them after appending the markup to the dom
[01:47:06] <Cork> Anticom: i wonder if you replace the element so the event handler is lost
[01:47:50] <Anticom> Cork i don't think so. when binding the events the dom isn't touched afterwards
[01:48:08] <Cork> Anticom: you are
[01:48:13] <Anticom> :o
[01:48:19] <Cork> your adding a copy of it around the element
[01:48:27] <Cork> and then bind the listener to the original
[01:48:34] <Anticom> where?
[01:48:50] <Cork> line 235
[01:48:56] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/869Xj/6/show/
[01:49:08] <Cork> or rather line 237
[01:49:20] <Anticom> oO
[01:49:48] <Anticom> 235: "                    } else {" and 237: "                    }" in my fiddle V6
[01:49:57] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/869Xj/6/show/ <--
[01:50:22] <Anticom> oh you meant in the source^^
[01:50:48] <Anticom> Cork but the bindings happen at line 271 pp
[01:50:56] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/7/
[01:51:06] <Cork> ya but $container points to another element then what is in the document
[01:51:20] <Cork> $container points to an element that isn't in the page
[01:51:50] <Anticom> Cork because .wrap() clones the element before actually doing its thing?
[01:52:00] <Cork> no it serializes it to html
[01:52:12] <Anticom> hm, thought jq was more magical :P
[01:52:19] <Cork> not with wrap
[01:52:33] <Anticom> so i need to get a reference using e.g. base.$el.parent() ?
[01:52:43] <Cork> wrap is one of my least favorite functions acutally
[01:52:50] <Cork> Anticom: use /7/
[01:54:06] <Anticom> Cork... i would marry you if i could ^.^
[01:54:11] <Anticom> haha
[01:54:14] <Cork> heh
[01:54:16] <Anticom> thank's so much
[01:54:20] <Cork> np
[01:54:22] <bn`> Hi. I have a question about jQuery mobile. I've defined swipe-events left and right and they both work fine, but when I swipe in one direction I have to do this twice. So it event is fired the second time I swipe in the same direction when the direction was changed. So when I was swiping left and want to swipe right I have to swipe twice
[01:54:38] <bn`> When I swipe on in the same direction it is fired with the first swipe
[01:55:57] <bn`> Is this a know issue/bug? All I did is defining the events with jQuery(selector).on("swipeleft", function() { jQuery.mobile.changePage(".."); }); and same for swiperight
[02:01:18] <bn`> Ok sorry. It was not about jquery. I fixed it. It was just taking the wrong page (same page as the current) the first time, so there was no page change. :)
[02:02:54] <Anticom> I'm developing a JQuery plugin and i'm having problems with vertically aligning two elements. Please see http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/8/show/ and hover over one of the textareas. A toolbar should appear with a button and a combobox in it. I want those to be aligned vertically centered inside the toolbar
[02:05:12] <Cork> Anticom: vertical-align: middle?
[02:05:30] <Anticom> oops, supposed to go to #css
[02:05:40] <Anticom> anyways i've got that applied to tokeneditor-toolbar already :/
[02:05:51] <Anticom> I'll ask over at #css
[02:06:32] <Cork> Anticom: simplest is to add padding to the container instead of a height
[02:06:54] <bn`> But I have some other question. I've implemented sounds using jquery sound, which is not very compatible. So I want to use the Media class of phonegap now, but it says that "Media is not defined"
[02:07:22] <bn`> Using version 2.2
[02:07:24] <Anticom> Cork but how would i position it relative to the textarea then? I need to know the toolbar's height in order to be able to position it right above the textarea accuratley
[02:07:45] <Anticom> hmm or i'd have to position it afterwards
[02:07:50] <Anticom> I'll think about that
[02:10:41] <Cork> Anticom: what would top: -1.3rem; ?
[02:10:47] <Cork> uh...
[02:10:58] <Anticom> ?
[02:11:04] <Cork> opps *Anticom: top: -1.3rem;
[02:11:07] <Anticom> what's the unit rem? and why exactly 1.3?
[02:11:25] <Cork> 1.0 is a line-height normally
[02:11:45] <Cork> but ya, it would depend on the styles of the elements
[02:11:56] <Cork> you could use a wrapper for the toolbar though
[02:12:36] <Cork> .wrapper { top:0; position: absolute; } .tokeneditor-toolbar { bottom: 0; }
[02:12:48] <systemfault> Anticom: They're RootEMs, instead of being relative to the font-size of itself or its parents, it's based on the font-size on the root element (<html>)
[02:12:56] <Cork> oh and the wrapper should be height: 0;
[02:17:59] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/9/
[02:18:09] <Cork> bah he timed out...
[02:24:02] <Anticom> re
[02:24:04] <Anticom> sorry, router died
[02:24:04] <Anticom> ._.
[02:26:25] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/10/
[02:26:34] <Cork> no need for all that calculations
[02:26:37] <Cork> just let css do it
[02:26:50] <Anticom> fiddle is still loading^^
[02:27:16] <Anticom> You know i'm more of a backend guy. just doing some jq widgets from time to time
[02:27:24] <Anticom> that's why they're so crappy ;)
[02:28:08] <Cork> it's not really crappy
[02:28:16] <Cork> it's over complicated
[02:28:46] <Cork> and yes it is kinda common that ppl try to do everything in js if they arn't used to web development
[02:28:47] <Anticom> Cork but now it's not pixel-perfect anymore :(
[02:28:58] <Cork> cause "that is how you do it in apps"
[02:29:12] <Cork> Anticom: it wasn't px perfect before here
[02:29:21] <Anticom> sec
[02:29:22] <Cork> it looks A LOT better here now actually
[02:29:43] <Cork> before the dropdown arrow was outside the toolber
[02:30:01] <Cork> btw what isn't matching up anymore?
[02:30:18] <Cork> it should match up quite well now, you might need to weeks small things like margins or padding
[02:30:26] <Cork> but it should be fairly simple css changes
[02:30:53] <Cork> Anticom: remember though pixel perfect is often a counter productive target for the web
[02:31:05] <Anticom> Cork why?
[02:31:08] <Cork> cause different browser and different operation systems look different
[02:31:20] <Cork> so it you pixel control it too much it will break on other platforms
[02:31:52] <Cork> a common problem is to put a static px height that looks perfect on windows
[02:32:00] <Cork> and then it sticks over the side in mac and linux
[02:32:15] <Cork> (the text does i mean)
[02:32:57] <Anticom> hm
[02:33:01] <Anticom> however that's what i meant: http://imgur.com/RFSnOFJ
[02:33:39] <Anticom> and btw i was happy with how the toolbar itself was aligned... i just want its childs to be aligned vertically (meaning the button & combobox)
[02:33:42] <Cork> Anticom: so you need to account for the spacing between the textarea and the wrapper
[02:33:47] <Anticom> beacause that looks crappy
[02:35:11] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/urLu3/1/ see here it fits perfectly in the big textarea
[02:36:07] <Anticom> oh fu... i just realised when trying to choose something from the combobox list the toolbar fades out
[02:36:09] <Anticom> :(
[02:36:15] <Anticom> what a mess ._.
[02:37:40] <Cork> ah, it needs the content width control directive
[02:37:47] <Cork> ... and i've forgotten its name >_<
[02:38:06] <Cork> right box-sizing
[02:40:02] <Anticom> huh?
[02:42:22] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/11/
[02:42:57] <Cork> the magic of css :D
[02:43:13] <Anticom> thanks :)
[02:43:18] <Anticom> but the button and combobox still arent aligned vertically :(
[02:43:55] <Cork> ya, cause one is of type input
[02:44:23] <Cork> and input buttons S-U-C-K-S for padding align and height handling
[02:44:23] <Anticom> hmm
[02:44:41] <Anticom> okay, i'll get over it^^
[02:44:55] <Anticom> so any ideas why the toolbar disapperas when hovering over the combobox list?
[02:46:03] <Anticom> oh i see... the list is not inside the container
[02:46:09] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/14/
[02:46:23] <Anticom> wow
[02:47:04] <Cork> the tooltip breaks things though :/
[02:47:10] <Cork> as it's not a child of the container
[02:47:24] <Anticom> Cork in my code i simply disabled the tooltip :D
[02:47:31] <Cork> so mouseleave triggers if you move the mose over the tooltip before it shows
[02:47:44] <Cork> *the mouse over
[02:47:56] <Cork> bah.. *before it hides >_<
[02:48:16] <Anticom> so you mean the "Show all items" tooltip or did you mean the selection list from the combobox?
[02:48:32] <Cork> both
[02:48:42] <marl_scot> anyone able to recomend a plugin that will give me a dropdown list snippet names and insert the snippet at current cursor? i have searched the site, and keep getting template plugin, but i want this as a menu rather than a popup, also need the snippet name/snippit code list to be quite basic within code, as it will get generated as part of my backend, does that make sense?
[02:48:42] <Cork> they both does the same, but ya i mean the show all items
[02:48:51] <Anticom> hm so i probably have to rework my show/hide logic i guess Cork ?
[02:49:14] <Cork> Anticom: or make the autocomplete use the container as offset parent
[02:49:24] <Anticom> marl_scot use jcaret plugin and build the rest on your own
[02:49:36] <Cork> Anticom: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-appendTo
[02:50:03] <Cork> and a similar option for the tooltip
[02:50:11] <Anticom> Cork well the combobox is taken from the jq-ui autocomplete example page and uses the widget factory. and i don't know a single thing about how this thing works
[02:51:44] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/15/
[02:51:52] <Cork> you wouild have to solve the tooltip you're self
[02:52:16] <marl_scot> thanks Anticom , that looks something like what i need
[02:56:34] <Anticom> Cork you're a god! lots of appreciation
[02:56:38] <Anticom> i'll figure out the rest
[03:01:01] <Anticom> Cork where are you actually from? I'd definitively buy you a beer! :)
[03:01:12] <Cork> sweden
[03:04:37] <Anticom> Hm, some day we'll do that. But I'll bring some german beer with me haha
[03:05:32] <Cork> heh
[03:06:16] <n3lthon> hi, how can i trigger a method when change the month on the datepicker?
[03:07:41] <pingec> Oh lol I justl ost 3 hours to figure out that scrollbar appearing/disappearing will not trigger a window.resize event (although it will change the window's size)
[03:08:55] <Cork> pingec: ya, the scrollbar is inside the window, not outside
[03:10:18] <pingec> Cork ?
[03:10:37] <Cork> pingec: resize is fired when the browser window is resized
[03:10:57] <pingec> well its a bit funny to me
[03:10:58] <Cork> the scrollbar is inside the window, so the dimensions of the window doens't change
[03:11:05] <jmmy> This javascript for pusher real-time service is copied out of text, but doesn't seem to work for me. Mind take a glance please
[03:11:16] <jmmy> http://jsfiddle.net/F23ca/
[03:11:25] <pingec> my point of vie is this:
[03:11:39] <pingec> window.height() = 850
[03:11:45] <pingec> *scroll bar appears*
[03:11:59] <Cork> pingec: ya, but that is innerHeight not the window height
[03:12:07] <pingec> hmm
[03:12:07] <Cork> that is the difference
[03:12:18] <pingec> well outerHeight is the same
[03:12:29] <Cork> outerHeight is innerHeight too :)
[03:12:38] <pingec> what :o
[03:12:41] <Cork> you can't get the full window height anymore
[03:12:46] <pingec> aha
[03:13:01] <Cork> it's an old legacy none cross browser value used WAY back before innerHeight
[03:13:14] <Anticom> jmmy this is #jquery and not #javascript i'm afraid :/
[03:13:30] <Cork> and when it was the only value, you had to account for the height of the toolbar IN THE BROWSER
[03:13:37] <Cork> but.. you had no way to get that value
[03:13:46] <Cork> THAT was a real pain i tell you...
[03:14:29] <pingec> So I cannot get the outerHeight of the window?
[03:14:38] <Cork> why would you want to?
[03:14:50] <Cork> and no, not as far as i know (cross browser)
[03:14:50] <pingec> To detect the scrollbar :)
[03:15:03] <jmmy> I think the programmers here would be more upto date, but I'll try javascript  channel
[03:15:04] <pingec> scrollbar = outer - inner
[03:15:15] <Cork> pingec: scrollHeight
[03:15:27] <pingec> Hmm whats that
[03:15:39] <Cork> it will give you the total height of the content of the page
[03:15:50] <pingec> lets try
[03:15:54] <Cork> if it is height then the height of the page, you have scrollbars
[03:16:16] <Cork> i don't remember on what element you needed to run it for the viewport though
[03:16:47] <Cork> jmmy: what is that service using for delivering the data?
[03:17:05] <Cork> commet, long pull, websocket?
[03:17:13] <Cork> flash?
[03:18:25] <jmmy> the new html5 one when available, and then degrades to other older technologies.  I'm can't remember what though, let me skim and get back
[03:19:06] <Cork> pingec: opps sorry its https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.scrollMaxY
[03:19:15] <Cork> scrollHeight is for normal elements
[03:19:33] <Cork> jmmy: the new one is websocket
[03:20:27] <jmmy> Cork, thx
[03:20:39] <pingec> Cork is this cross browser?
[03:22:11] <Cork> pingec: it's dom0 so not fully sure
[03:22:53] <pingec> doesnt work in chrome
[03:22:57] <pingec> returns undefined
[03:23:15] <Cork> pingec: try document.documentElement.scrollHeight
[03:23:23] <acr> is it possible to keep global defined variables after a page reload with javascript? if its possible then how?
[03:23:48] <Cork> acr: store them in a none volatile location and restore them on next page load
[03:24:12] <acr> Cork: how do i do this? sorry i am new to js :)
[03:24:22] <Cork> like cookie, server, params, indexeddb (sessionStorage/localStorage)
[03:24:32] <acr> ah ok :) thanks ;)
[03:24:58] <Cork> acr: or simple don't reload the page
[03:25:09] <Cork> reload the content that needs to be replaced
[03:26:02] <pingec> Cork it is returning the innerHeight
[03:26:15] <pingec> I guess Ill just workaround it
[03:26:23] <pingec> with some ugly hack
[03:27:01] <Cork> pingec: if((document.documentElement.scrollHeight - document.documentElement.clientHeight) > 0) { /* has scrollbar */ }
[03:29:18] <pingec> Cork it does not work for me
[03:29:30] <pingec> They are the same all the time
[03:29:34] <Cork> hmm
[03:30:00] <Cork> weird; guess i would have to test run it though, cause that is basically what i run here
[03:30:14] <Anticom> oh noes jcaret isn't compatible with jq v1.9.x
[03:30:31] <pingec> Oh well Ill figure it out
[03:30:36] <Cork> ?g jquery migration

[03:33:17] <acr> Cork: is it possible to store them without using sessions or cookies?
[03:33:31] <Cork> acr: no
[03:33:47] <acr> hmm damn
[03:34:03] <Cork> acr: those 6 solutions is the only way
[03:34:14] <acr> cuz when a page is loaded i am checking whether an object instance is created or not
[03:34:25] <acr> then i am checking if a property is set in there
[03:34:37] <acr> but i only want to instantiate it once
[03:34:44] <acr> and not with every page reload
[03:35:29] <Cork> well objects is reset when the page unloads
[03:35:46] <Cork> so you will have to recreate them if the page has been unloaded
[03:37:05] <Anticom> Cork well, it's not cross browser but local storage would be an alternative
[03:37:15] <Anticom> although it basically is like cookies
[03:37:20] <acr> okay another possible option than comes in my mind was if its possible to load the object with ajax?
[03:37:33] <Cork> Anticom: that was the 5 and 6 alternative
[03:37:55] <acr> but cookies can be turned off by the user right?
[03:38:06] <acr> so if a user is not allowing cookies i am not able to set them
[03:38:08] <Anticom> oh, must have overlooked that
[03:38:08] <Cork> the user can turn anything of
[03:38:10] <Cork> it's there computer
[03:38:16] <Cork> Anticom: cookie, server, params, indexeddb, localStorage (sessionStorage/localStorage) <--
[03:38:18] <Anticom> acr javascript can also be turned off...
[03:38:24] <Cork> yes
[03:38:32] <acr> sure it can be
[03:38:55] <acr> Cork: with params you mean query params?
[03:38:57] <Cork> and also localstorage can't store objects
[03:39:13] <Cork> that or hash
[03:39:17] <Anticom> acr if your application realy requires those features you should make sure the user enables what you need by hinting him when it's not and use those technologies
[03:39:20] <Cork> url#data
[03:39:22] <Anticom> that's what they're there for
[03:39:35] <Anticom> Cork it can't?! :o
[03:39:46] <Cork> Anticom: nope just serialized data
[03:39:52] <Anticom> hm
[03:39:55] <Anticom> result is the same
[03:39:59] <acr> thanks :)
[03:39:59] <Cork> no
[03:40:06] <Anticom> although that means you can't store DOM references for example...
[03:40:21] <Cork> Anticom: if you bind events on a dom element and try to store that in a localstorage you will see the difference
[03:40:35] <Anticom> that's what i just realised ;)
[03:40:41] <Cork> or if you add a function to an object and try to store that
[03:41:11] <Cork> Anticom:  var a = { action: function() { alert('hello'); } };
[03:41:25] <Cork> try store that with as a working object in storage
[03:41:34] <Anticom> ok ok i got it :P
[03:41:57] <Anticom> Cork although you could build some kind of workarounds with eval for the second issue. but it would get veeeeeery ugly
[03:42:10] <Cork> Anticom: you would have to do something like b = {}; b.a = a.a.toSource(); JSON.stringify(b);
[03:42:16] <Anticom> eval is called eval for a reason... because it's evil^^
[03:42:46] <Cork> Anticom: it cause it's hard to debug, is many WEIRD legacy behaviors
[03:42:57] <Anticom> and it's unsafe
[03:43:01] <Anticom> due to injections
[03:43:06] <Cork> and easy to exploit if a hacker manage to do xss on the page
[03:43:12] <systemfault> And it's slow :P
[03:43:17] <Cork> ya
[03:43:22] <Cork> as it can't be jitted
[03:43:22] <Anticom> and no one likes it :D
[03:43:23] <Anticom> haha
[03:43:34] <Cork> csp FTW!
[03:43:37] <Rockwood> hello
[03:43:37] <acr> haha :D
[03:43:57] <Cork> (csp disalbes eval by default)
[03:43:59] <Anticom> Cork the tokeneditor widget became a real beauty thank's to you :)
[03:44:09] <Anticom> i'll give credits to you in the docblock :)
[03:44:21] <Cork> heh
[03:45:56] <Cork> pingec: this doesn't return false | true for you? http://jsfiddle.net/aS9Wg/3/
[03:50:18] <pingec> Cork yes it does
[03:50:30] <Rockwood> i think all pps are busy in help room
[03:50:31] <pingec> I need to study this now
[03:51:12] <Cork> Rockwood: if you have a question you need to ask it if you want help with it
[03:53:15] <Rockwood> yes
[03:53:21] <Rockwood> i have form
[03:53:42] <Rockwood> in the form i have two submit buttons
[03:53:59] <Rockwood> i wanna tranfert values of those buttons
[03:54:06] <Rockwood> tansfer
[03:54:20] <Rockwood> jquery and ajax
[03:54:55] <Rockwood> in short i am  going to post my code in jsfiddle
[03:55:10] <Cork> Rockwood: you're kinda out of luck with that; there isn't really a good solution to get what button triggered a submit event on a form
[03:55:37] <Cork> only solution for it is to bind a click handler on the buttons and set a hidden field to the value you want for the submit event
[03:55:48] <Rockwood> okay check once please
[03:55:52] <pingec> Cork this is my scenario:
[03:56:05] <pingec> I have html and body set to 100% width. In the body there is a div which is wider than the body and the scrollbar is present. scrollWidth and clientWidth are 871. Then I resize the div to something smaller, the scrollbar disappears, scrollWidth and clientWidth are both 888
[03:57:37] <Cork> pingec: could you make a small fiddle to show the problem?
[03:59:37] <Rockwood> lol internet is slow
[04:01:25] <n3lthon> is there a callback after month and/or year change on datepicker?
[04:01:57] <pingec> Cork I guess I would have to copy all css applied as well but dont know how
[04:02:35] <Cork> n3lthon: the docs looks a bit weird for the datepicker, it doesn't list ANY callbacks anymore :/
[04:02:40] <Cork> so not sure actually
[04:04:11] <n3lthon> cork: i know, im trying onChangeMonthYear , but it trigger the method before the html change and i need to add classes to html after it change to the new month :/
[04:04:28] <Rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/DLV4m/1/
[04:04:37] <Rockwood> this my query code
[04:05:17] <Cork> Rockwood: serialize doens't include the buttons in the form
[04:05:31] <Cork> and also if it did it would include both, not the one pressed
[04:05:43] <Rockwood> like hows ?
[04:05:53] <Rockwood> can once for me ?
[04:06:03] <Rockwood> i am newbie
[04:06:21] <Rockwood> if possible ?
[04:06:41] <Rockwood> i am badly stuck on this from the morning
[04:06:59] <Rockwood> nad almost night time here
[04:07:25] <Cork> and also if it did it would include both, not the one pressed
[04:07:27] <Cork> opps
[04:07:32] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/DLV4m/2/
[04:07:45] <acr> rockwood you can do this with asp.net and jquery
[04:08:14] <acr> there you can simply add events to buttons and check whether they have triggered a specific event (with eventhandlers) and then use simply jquery
[04:08:41] <Cork> acr: nothing special with .net there
[04:08:59] <Rockwood> with php and jquery
[04:09:05] <Cork> .net only adds wrapper handling for javascript
[04:09:18] <Cork> it will always be javascript in the end anyway so...
[04:09:27] <Rockwood> i dont know much about .net
[04:09:38] <Rockwood> i am doing in php
[04:09:43] <Cork> Rockwood: i have answered how to do it twice now, i won't do it a third time...
[04:11:01] <Rockwood> means ?
[04:11:13] <Cork> read the responses to your question...
[04:11:29] <Rockwood> i want use this on rating of use
[04:11:52] <pingec> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/pingo/rs6f5/1/ drag the frames height up and down so that the vertical scrollbar appears
[04:12:07] <pingec> (or disappears)
[04:15:19] <Rockwood> THanks Cork
[04:15:30] <pingec> And sorry for the ugly example
[04:15:44] <Rockwood> acr  i am doing this php and Jquery
[04:16:10] <Cork> pingec: the outer div is absolute
[04:16:18] <Cork> pingec: so the page isn't changing height
[04:16:58] <Cork> pingec: http://jsfiddle.net/rs6f5/2/
[04:17:32] <Cork> opps missed that it has a fixed height
[04:20:36] <pingec> Cork what did you change?
[04:20:52] <Cork> pingec: removed the position absolute on the outer div
[04:21:06] <Cork> so that the document actually wrapps the content
[04:21:32] <Cork> the document was always 100% of the page and ca 20 px height
[04:21:58] <Cork> when the position absolute was removed it wrapped the content, and you got the correct sizes
[04:27:51] <pingec> Cork I'm not sure I understand
[04:28:29] <pingec> Doesnt the document wrap the <html>
[04:28:33] <pingec> and html is set to 100%
[04:28:41] <pingec> I guess 100% of window?
[04:31:17] <Cork> pingec: http://jsfiddle.net/rs6f5/3/
[04:31:36] <Cork> pingec: the div doesn't affect the size of the body
[04:31:45] <Cork> cause it has position absolute
[04:33:02] <Cork> pingec: little more data http://jsfiddle.net/rs6f5/4/
[04:34:33] <pingec> hmm
[04:35:43] <ggwalle> hi all
[04:35:49] <ggwalle> i use jquery layout ui
[04:36:03] <ggwalle> i want it not wrap the west panel
[04:36:20] <zulu-gula> I want to do nice dynamic moving element but I need exactly coordinates for all browsers. now I'm testing under FF and Chrome and see, that $(element).position is different for both browsers
[04:36:41] <zulu-gula> is there any way to get same position under those 2 browsers? or I need to detect browser and then get position of element?
[04:36:51] <ggwalle> in west panel, there is <ul> list, if resize it's should show x scrollbar
[04:36:51] <zulu-gula> separately for each browser
[04:38:25] <Cork> zulu-gula: the values from the position should be correct based on that browser
[04:38:29] <acr> Cork, Rockwood, ah ok it was just an option that i want to give :)
[04:40:32] <Rockwood> sure acr
[04:40:43] <acr> is there a possibility to check with jquery if an object was found?
[04:41:30] <pingec> Cork but why does body height even matter?
[04:41:36] <acr> smth like if($(".class") { // do smth } else { // do some other }
[04:41:37] <pingec> Im looking at width
[04:41:45] <pingec> and body's width is set
[04:41:59] <Cork> pingec: cause that is the element you can check scrollHeight on
[04:42:06] <Cork> document.documentElement you know?
[04:42:25] <Cork> pingec: sure, but the width isn't affected by it's content, for the same reason
[04:42:48] <pingec> Cork aaaah
[04:42:54] <pingec> I was doing it all wrong lol
[04:43:19] <Cork> position: absolute broke it all ya
[04:43:34] <pingec> Yes I got that, was just trying to understand why
[04:44:01] <Rockwood> i dont know
[04:44:55] <Rockwood> acr dont know
[04:45:13] <acr> rockwood found asolution
[04:45:54] <Rockwood> means ?
[04:46:06] <acr> this will work
[04:46:07] <acr> http://paste.schredder.me/1407/21036013/
[04:49:16] <Rockwood> i can php class object but not jquery
[04:49:32] <Rockwood> i can check php class object but dont jquery
[04:50:02] <acr> i just meant the CSS class of a specific DOM  element
[04:51:39] <Rockwood> 'wait google can help in this matter i ahve see
[04:53:13] <coldhead> so this is IRC huh
[04:55:39] <Cork> Rockwood: are talking about accessing jquery from php?
[04:55:52] <Rockwood> yes
[04:55:57] <Cork> you can't
[04:56:06] <Cork> php runs server side, and javascript runs in the browser
[04:56:24] <Cork> so jquery doesn't exist the php handlers the data
[04:56:34] <Rockwood> yes server side
[04:56:41] <coldhead> i can check php class object but dont jquery
[04:56:44] <Cork> php > html > net > browser > javascript > jquery
[04:57:06] <Cork> anything on the left side of the <net> can't access the right side, and vice versa
[04:57:16] <boytoy> alright noob time. On click, I need to find the closest ".find_me", then ".find_me_inside_find_me" and then execute show(); -- but what's wrong with my syntax? http://jsfiddle.net/A6Mj2/
[04:57:34] <coldhead> that's beautifully phrased, Cork
[04:58:07] <Cork> coldhead: then you give it a try if you prefer :)
[04:58:18] <Rockwood> Cork i wanna one more  thing transfer by dat jquery function
[04:58:30] <anton164> What would be a good way to make the background flash green, as when a user is successful, however not the whole background, but just like an inline-border?
[04:58:53] <Cork> Rockwood: you need to make a network call for the server to be able to give anything to javascript
[04:58:54] <anton164> And when I say background, I do mean the whole window
[04:59:13] <Cork> boytoy: you need to include the html structure you're working with for us to tell what you need
[04:59:19] <coldhead> for reals, Cork, i had never thought of it in those terms
[04:59:45] <Rockwood> like ?

[05:05:29] <Cork> updateDatepicker huh...
[05:05:35] <Cork> n3lthon: thx for the link
[05:08:37] <lemonsparrow> how to detect backspace key using jquery
[05:08:58] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/abesap/1/edit how do I show() all p.find_me_inside_find_me?
[05:08:59] <Cork> keyCode in the key* event
[05:09:11] <boytoy> Made the background myself in my little art studio ;)
[05:09:32] <Cork> boytoy: $('.find_me_inside_find_me').show() ?
[05:09:47] <Cork> boytoy: also careful with display: none;
[05:10:09] <Cork> it has a tendency to break things
[05:10:50] <boytoy> Cork: but it's gotta be each .find_me_inside_find_me that is inside a .find_me, so basically you can see I'm trying the same thing 3 different ways in that jsbin there.. just not sure about that first line in each of them..
[05:10:57] <lemonsparrow> Cork: $("#field").keypress(function(event){alert(event.which);});  once pressed backspace no alert coming..  like a=65
[05:11:05] <boytoy> yeah I just had a major fight with display: none; :D
[05:11:08] <boytoy> we almost broke up lol
[05:11:49] <Cork> boytoy: http://jsbin.com/eriluc/1/edit
[05:12:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: any idea ?
[05:12:52] <Cork> $("#field").keypress(function(event){alert(event.keyCode);});
[05:14:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: var e = window.event || event   var keyunicode =  e.keyCode;  alert(keyunicode);  once "backspace" is pressed no alerts are coming.. : i want to trap the backspace in my code
[05:14:32] <boytoy> Cork: but how do I phrase $(this).closest('div').find('.find_me') in order to put $('.find_me_inside_find_me').show(); inside it?
[05:15:06] <Cork> boytoy: right sorry forgot the original question
[05:15:13] <boytoy> i.e. do I do like function($(this).closest('div').find('.find_me')) or if($(this).closest('div').find('.find_me') == true) etc. in order to make it execute?
[05:15:29] <boytoy> cool i can probably do a better job at explaining it one sec
[05:15:49] <Cork> boytoy: that one is hard
[05:16:26] <Cork> oh, wait i though you wanted the child of it
[05:16:34] <Cork> so its just a nextAll
[05:16:40] <Cork> $(this).nextAll('.find_me').first()
[05:16:58] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/abesap/1/edit -- how do I properly execute show() inside $(this).closest('div').find('.find_me')?
[05:17:03] <Cork> or just $(this).next() if you are sure nothing will be inbetween
[05:17:33] <Cork> boytoy: closest from .main_link wont' ever find anything
[05:17:40] <Cork> as the a tag doens't have a div parent
[05:17:58] <Cork> you will have to look for simblings (next), not a parent
[05:17:59] <boytoy> sorry i forgot to add that in
[05:18:02] <Cork> ?.closest
[05:18:02] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[05:21:28] <boytoy> Cork: Updated: http://jsbin.com/abesap/1/edit
[05:22:04] <boytoy> not sure how to do $(this).closest('div').find('.find_me').function({, tried a buncha different syntaxes but
[05:22:07] <Cork> and well i still say $(this).nextAll('.find_me') is what you want
[05:22:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: var e = window.event || event              var keyunicode =  e.keyCode; 			 alert(keyunicode);   I want an alert when backspace is been pressed..
[05:22:46] <Cork> boytoy: though ya, $(this).closest('div').find('.find_me') should work too, it would look a bit deeper though
[05:23:12] <boytoy> Cork: the original goes quite deep to be honest
[05:23:28] <Cork> it checks all children of the wrapper
[05:23:59] <boytoy> Cork: but what im wondering is *how* to execute show() after $(this).closest('div').find('.find_me') -- you can see i tried a .function({ but that syntax is probably dead wrong right?
[05:24:47] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/MGz5w/
[05:25:00] <boytoy> also tried function($(this).closest('div').find('.find_me')) { ... }(); but nope
[05:25:29] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and one that actually prevents it http://jsfiddle.net/MGz5w/1/
[05:25:43] <Cork> boytoy: i don't see the problem
[05:25:59] <Cork> why doens't $(this).nextAll('.find_me').first() work?
[05:26:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[05:29:46] <boytoy> Cork: sure we can use that, but my problem is how to turn this into something that can be executed? its more of a basic jquery syntax issue.. $(this).nextAll('.find_me').first() { $('.find_me_inside_find_me').show(); }); aint valid right?
[05:30:41] <boytoy> Updated http://jsbin.com/abesap/2/edit

[06:19:45] <pashworth> Hi, I'm having a problem with load time on a site I'm trying to mobalise using JQuery mobile. I've needed to disable the ajax enabled feature due to the way the site already handles session information and uses the url to do so. But because of this each time I navigate to a new page its taking an extra 20 seconds. I think this is down to having to re load the javascript files each time. Is there a good way to cut this down?

[06:54:56] <natas77> hi guys i am looking for a way to create a one page scroll page like this : http://www.trionndesign.com/  soo wich plug-in dou you guys http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/suggest.html
[06:55:18] <natas77> suggest
[06:55:52] <natas77> i saw this  one but it dont work to me : http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll/index.html
[06:58:22] <stacktrace> in this method the hide will not execute:
[06:58:23] <stacktrace> $('#action').animate({'left':'580px' }, slow, function(){    $('#action').hide();});
[06:58:38] <stacktrace> same if i call the hide separately
[06:59:18] <c4ptnh00k> natas77 looks kinda like bootstrap
[07:01:21] <joobz> any idea how to achieve something like the scroll effect thes guys are using https://www.spotify.com/au/ ? kinda like that two layer effect, where 1 scroll is slower than the other
[07:02:08] <c4ptnh00k> stacktrace: you could use slide left and just give it a timmer if you are running jquery ui
[07:02:33] <natas77> c4ptnh00k: yes. dou you know other plug-ins?
[07:03:39] <stacktrace> got it
[07:03:41] <stacktrace> thx
[07:03:59] <c4ptnh00k> np
[07:04:30] <gabeodess> If I have $this = $('#recipes input:checkbox');  How can I then find "checked" items on that variable?
[07:04:42] <c4ptnh00k> joobz: alot of css and some creative html5 stuff will do it. Have not tried to make this happen with jquery
[07:04:46] <gabeodess> I tried .find(':checked') but to no avail
[07:05:26] <c4ptnh00k> natas77: Not too familiar with alot of other options but you can look up alternatives to bootstrap
[07:06:20] <gabeodess> natas77: what's your question?
[07:06:34] <c4ptnh00k> gabeodess: if($'elem').prop('checked', true)){do stuff}
[07:07:23] <natas77> gabeodess i am looking for a way to crete a one page scroll plug-in
[07:07:43] <natas77> gabeodess: like this one : http://www.trionndesign.com/
[07:13:19] <didiergm> hi are there any known issues with ajax request when the html page uses a cache manifest ? Currently with the cache manifest my ajax call are receiving an "error" TextStatus whilst they are working fine if I remove the cache manifest. First time I see this happening
[07:15:36] <c4ptnh00k> didiergm: I haven't a clue tbh. I can google though and this is what i found ajax request when the html page uses a cache manifest
[07:15:51] <c4ptnh00k> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8713814/should-html-5-cache-manifest-work-with-ajax-requests-too
[07:16:51] <didiergm> c4ptnh00k I googled too but could not find conclusive answers I'll read what you've found
[07:17:29] <c4ptnh00k> didiergm: Sorry I couldnt be of more help
[07:17:57] <psynor> dumb question.  if I am using load to load a form into a div for example, can I reference the elements of that form and use jquery on them?
[07:18:15] <didiergm> c4ptnH00k np, I was already reading that same page .... I have done it before w/o issues and here bang! none work ... me : puzzled
[07:24:31] <c4ptnh00k> psynor: Sorry I didnt see you msg till now, but yes you can as long as you do not try to access the elements untill after the .load()
[07:25:14] <silmarils> hello
[07:25:24] <c4ptnh00k> hi
[07:25:36] <silmarils> I have a SVG map with 3 countries, and I want that when you hover one country, one paragraph of my page is highlighted, do you know how can I do ?
[07:29:24] <psynor> c4ptnh00k: thanks!
[07:30:19] <c4ptnh00k> silmarils: not an easy way, but it goes pretty straight forward. you slice the map into elements and create .hover(function(){$('div.demo-container').text().highlight('my text');})
[07:30:32] <c4ptnh00k> psynor:np :P
[07:31:14] <silmarils> c4ptnh00k, in fact it is a svg file, so it is already "sliced"
[07:31:46] <silmarils> in fact, what I need to know is how to access to a specific part of the svg with the DOM ...
[07:34:06] <llaskin> anyone here using testswarm with jenkins?
[07:38:29] <c4ptnh00k> lol srry its still early here. but IN FACT thats what you should have asked lol the answer is... Im not sure I'd have to look on google
[07:39:01] <c4ptnh00k> llaskin: Sorry never heard of it
[07:39:26] <llaskin> i'm having issues with the jenkins plugin, and as such, was hoping that maybe someone using testswarm here might be using it with jenkins....its doubling the URL up causing it to be a bad URL
[07:40:13] <fbernier> Hey, I have a jquery library which binds events to particular elements once it's loaded. A client is trying to integrate it but he is using jQuery.noConflict() so it breaks the usage of my library. What are his possibilities?
[07:42:10] <c4ptnh00k> fbernier: Are you including a different version of jquery for your plugin?
[07:43:14] <fbernier> <c4ptnh00k> No I let the client integrate jQuery himself
[07:44:59] <c4ptnh00k> fbernier: noconflict() should just handle if theere are conflicting versions of jquery. it boils down to a scoping issue. but I dont know what problem your client is having with your library
[07:45:01] <myosotis> fbernier, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/ has multiple ways to solve your problem on it
[07:45:30] <fbernier> <c4ptnh00k> I think he's using it because of conflict with other libraries ...
[07:47:02] <fbernier> mysotis: I looked into it but the fact that the client has nothing to call to use the library except simply including it is where I don't really know what to suggest him ...
[07:47:03] <c4ptnh00k> fbernier: I just dont think it works that way, but I can be wrong. I know if you have two declarations of $ in an app you can specify which one you want to use with noConflict(true);
[07:48:35] <myosotis> I'm saying you should modify your library to work even if noconflict has been called.
[07:51:02] <fbernier> myosotis: By replacing every $ with jQuery ?
[07:51:26] <fbernier> this is standard stuff in libraries depending on jquery ?
[07:51:46] <myosotis> you can wrap all your code in 1 or 2 lines of code and not change anything
[07:51:48] <shoky> no, read through the link he gave you
[07:51:50] <myosotis> read the damn page I linked
[07:52:43] <myosotis> (function($) { PLACE YOUR LIBRARY CODE USING $ HERE})(jQuery);
[07:52:51] <fbernier> yeah just remembered that
[07:52:55] <fbernier> thanks
[07:53:06] <fbernier> so this is common thing to do in jquery libraries ?
[07:53:16] <c4ptnh00k> yes
[07:53:23] <fbernier> great then
[07:53:26] <fbernier> problem solved
[07:53:28] <fbernier> thanks!
[08:03:45] <intellix> is it possible to run code after an array of promises?
[08:03:59] <intellix> I'm doing $.when.apply(null, promises)
[08:05:39] <lamarus> what is the best way to make this not suck by removing the .live   http://jsfiddle.net/yshzy/
[08:05:47] <dcherman> intellix: that's correct
[08:06:21] <intellix> I guess I have to maintain state outside of the promises stuff and then do something at the end
[08:06:53] <intellix> like, amountLeft = things.length; amountLeft--; if (amountLeft === 0) { do thing afterwards }
[08:07:33] <intellix> I basically want to do one thing after ALL promises in an array are done
[08:09:10] <intellix> I can see 2x AJAX calls inside $.when() in the documentation but my amount of deferred's are dynamic so have to pass via array
[08:18:48] <BillCris_> intellix: $.when.apply( null, arrayOfDeferreds );
[08:19:17] <intellix> but always() gets called 4x if there are 4 deferreds
[08:19:25] <intellix> I just want it to happen at the end of checking all of them
[08:21:51] <BillCris_> $.when.apply( null, arr ).done(function(){ console.log('WE IS LOADED'); });
[08:22:03] <BillCris_> http://jsfiddle.net/xnqbv/ Quick demo.
[08:32:51] <intellix> mmm works‚Ä¶. wonder why mine doesn't then!
[08:38:03] <BillCris_> This project is going way too smoothly. I hope my family is OK.
[08:43:10] <true_techie> why cant i interpolate a variable here? $('#photos').prepend('<img src=' + img[index] + ' />');
[08:44:27] <shoky> true_techie: no quotes around the src attribute?
[08:45:47] <shoky> well i guess it's not mandatory. otherwise that looks fine
[08:46:19] <true_techie> gives unexpected string error $('#photos').prepend('<img src='" + img[index] + "' />');
[08:46:31] <thang> double quotes should be inside the single quotes
[08:47:04] <shoky> or just.. $('<img>').attr({src: img[index]})
[08:47:51] <shoky> .prependTo('#photos')
[08:48:56] <true_techie_> i got disconnected
[08:49:08] <true_techie_> i got disconnected
[08:49:10] <shoky> $('<img>').attr({src: img[index]}).prependTo('#photos')
[08:50:41] <true_techie_> well the img element was appended without the src attribute
[08:50:58] <shoky> `demo
[08:50:58] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:51:27] <BillCris_> true_techie_: Are you sure you want img[index] and not img.index? If img an array of img src's?
[08:51:34] <shoky> maybe you have a loop/closure issue with the index
[08:51:36] <BillCris_> s/If/is
[08:56:54] <M4d3L> is there a way to do return $(a).find("span.score").text().toUpperCase().localeCompare($(b).find("span.score").text().toUpperCase());   but for numerical value?

[08:59:24] <thang> im trying to attach a handler to an ajax loaded dom node, but window.onLoad isnt giving me any love. any suggestions?
[09:01:07] <shoky> thang: what does window.onload have to do with it.. suggestions for what?
[09:01:31] <sacho> thang, what are you trying to handle with this handler?
[09:04:34] <thang> shoky: well i cant attach a handler to something thats not there yet, so im putting it in window.onLoad (which iirc waits for the page to finish loading) to do so
[09:04:53] <thang> unless ive mixed things up..
[09:05:03] <shoky> thang: window.onload does not wait for any ajax to finish loading
[09:05:07] <shoky> you've mixed things up
[09:05:08] <thang> shiet
[09:05:14] <sacho> thang, what are you trying to do?
[09:05:20] <shoky> you might wanna check out event delegation. see ?on
[09:05:21] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:06:23] <thang> sacho: im using kendo treeview, and i want to attach click handlers to certain nodes that ive marked with a specific selector to update a hidden field in a form
[09:06:24] <shoky> e.g.  $('#container').on('click', '.classOfAjaxLoadedElement', function() { .... })
[09:07:34] <thang> ?paste
[09:07:34] <b-ot> thang: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:07:34] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:08:19] <thang> shoky: so i was trying something more akin to this before: http://fixee.org/paste/z0iy6o6/
[09:08:29] <sirspazzolot> selector help. I want to perform a function for every tbody with attribute isLoaded="true". do I do $('tbody[isloaded="true"]').each(function...); ?
[09:08:56] <[m]adman> p
[09:10:12] <shoky> thang: well as i said that's wrong.. try event delegation.  (also it's onload not onLoad)
[09:10:20] <thang> womp
[09:12:16] <shoky> sirspazzolot: that should work ya
[09:12:32] <thang> shoky: winner.
[09:12:47] <sirspazzolot> shoky: yeah, my issue was I had no timeout. thanks!

[09:14:43] <skptmnky> where are the xpertz?
[09:15:05] <myosotis> skptmnky, the experts are probably busy ignoring your non-questions
[09:15:15] <skptmnky> y
[09:15:22] <myosotis> ask something less superficial, and you're far more likely to get an answer
[09:15:24] <thang> *xpertz
[09:15:36] <myosotis> if I came back to talk everytime somebody said "HEY! anybody around?" I wouldn't get any work done
[09:15:54] <myosotis> I'm certain many others feel the same way
[09:16:04] <skptmnky> i need help loop through tables using js.............
[09:16:15] <skptmnky> -.-
[09:18:17] <thang> what have you tried?
[09:19:08] <skptmnky> for loop but it keeps repeating the columns -_-
[09:19:19] <thang> lets see it. ?paste
[09:19:31] <skptmnky> fine
[09:21:07] <skptmnky> http://pastebin.com/3LmiNG5K
[09:21:48] <skptmnky> this is my code, the stuff in "myCont" keeps repeating twice for the two columns instead of once for each column. WHY?!
[09:22:21] <Bloomberg> Guys me gaian!!
[09:22:25] <Bloomberg> again*
[09:24:13] <Bloomberg> If I need to receive a set of dates from php and I'm using the .post function, how can I to use the .each function for show me each msg separated?
[09:27:37] <BillCris_> Bloomberg: If you get an array back you'd do $.each( messages, function( index, message ){ console.log( message ); });
[09:27:40] <BillCris_> http://jsbin.com/evevow/2/edit quick little demo.
[09:28:31] <BillCris_> You could use this instead of message in the loop as well.
[09:29:27] <didiergm> ping c4ptnh00k
[09:29:51] <FunnyLookinHat> In jQ 1.9.1 - is there a way to bind a change event to radio buttons being selected / unselected?  Or are we still left with the .click() event ?
[09:30:12] <c4ptnh00k> didiergm: yes?
[09:30:54] <didiergm> c4ptnhc00k: not sure if you remember earlier question re html cache manifest and ajax
[09:31:09] <jugstah> coldhead: around?
[09:31:18] <c4ptnh00k> didiergm: you figure it out
[09:31:21] <c4ptnh00k> ?
[09:31:36] <didiergm> c4ptnhc00k: yep : trick is NEVER use $.getJSON
[09:31:41] <\monster\> hey guys, if I have a async call which returns HTML form which i than append and bind submit button ..now when submit is click is handled the form data it sees is the one that originally came from the async call, it doesn't see any changes made to it by the client  ..I think this has something to do with closures :)
[09:31:57] <c4ptnh00k> didiergm: lol cool ill remember that
[09:32:02] <BillCris_> FunnyLookinHat: Change has always worked from what I can remember.
[09:32:08] <didiergm> c4ptnhc00k use $.ajax in POST ($.getJSON is get by default)
[09:32:18] <FunnyLookinHat> BillCris_, It doesn't seem to fire though...  hold on, making a fiddle.
[09:32:29] <BillCris_> FunnyLookinHat: http://jsbin.com/inifum/1/edit did this real quick.
[09:32:51] <Bloomberg> BillCris_: anyway doing what you suggest me, doesn't works
[09:32:58] <FunnyLookinHat> BillCris_, yeah, and in Chrome that does nothing :)
[09:33:05] <FunnyLookinHat> oh wait yes it does
[09:33:07] <Bloomberg> Show me all data in the same receiving
[09:33:32] <didiergm> c4ptnch00k that's a piece of valid info, it is nowhere clearly explained - just mentioned in passing at best
[09:33:34] <BillCris_> I would need to see the result. I'm assuming your message is an array.
[09:34:12] <Bloomberg> [11:33:58.607] 0 unodostres unodostres
[09:35:09] <BillCris_> That looks like a string...?
[09:35:26] <BillCris_> working too much in the dark here. Need more informaiton.
[09:36:47] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/alefuj/1/edit
[09:37:31] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/wSiTf2Hy
[09:37:45] <Bloomberg> There is the array from php and js script!!
[09:40:10] <BillCris_> Bloomberg: This would just return "OneTwoThree", do we wan to be able to loop through One, Two then Three?
[09:42:40] <Bloomberg> I want that for each one data show me one result
[09:43:03] <Bloomberg> for example if I instead of console.log() i do an alert()
[09:43:10] <Bloomberg> and show me three alerts differetns
[09:43:53] <BillCriswell> Ok, a few things.
[09:44:16] <BillCriswell> Why are you using .post? I think you want to be using .get.
[09:44:43] <Bloomberg> Is that I'm doing a task module
[09:44:52] <BillCriswell> You can just return JSON, instead of looping through each element in $data just do echo json_encode($data);
[09:45:13] <Bloomberg> So, you enter to you account and go to task module and this will tell you if you have works
[09:45:31] <Bloomberg> So for each one work in data base show you one alert
[09:45:39] <Bloomberg> I'm working with notify
[09:45:39] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Yeah.
[09:45:47] <BillCriswell> I don't know what that is.
[09:47:13] <Bloomberg> http://pinesframework.org/pnotify/
[09:47:15] <Bloomberg> is this
[09:47:24] <Bloomberg> Is a plugin for show the notification of the better way
[09:47:41] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: This isn't really related to your issue.
[09:47:57] <BillCriswell> You want an ajax request to return an array of things.
[09:48:14] <Bloomberg> yes
[09:48:24] <Bloomberg> But One thing for oe result
[09:48:30] <Bloomberg> Understand me?
[09:48:36] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:48:48] <Bloomberg> I dont want in the same notification show me all things
[09:49:02] <Bloomberg> I want one notification for each one thing
[09:49:07] <Bloomberg> How can I get it?
[09:54:07] <\monster\> arr was using .html() instead of .val()
[09:55:06] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: What do you suggest me?
[09:55:22] <BillCriswell> I said all I could.
[09:55:24] <rindolf> Hi all.
[09:55:55] <BillCriswell> if the ajax request gets: echo json_decode( $phpArray );
[09:56:02] <BillCriswell> then in the JavaScript you'd do...

[10:05:27] <c4ptnh00k> best practice question(I am changing the css of a nav button based on what page I am on. Should I make a small script on each page or one large script on my layout page?
[10:05:30] <c4ptnh00k> )
[10:07:40] <c4ptnh00k> I am thinking the small script on each page would perform better, but I do not have strange wizard powers like shoky
[10:08:03] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: I like to put a class on my body element for sitations like that, then I can do .weird-page .button { color: aqua; }
[10:08:25] <BillCriswell> I wouldn't use JavaScript for something like that.
[10:09:35] <BillCriswell> FOOD TIMES
[10:09:52] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: I did add a selector to the elem, but i want to actually add a class to the elem. I have a nav bar and I want to add .active to the li item based on url
[10:10:03] <c4ptnh00k> ok cya l8r man
[10:14:58] <zfly9> So I'm trying to set up a fiddle to ask for help but I can't even get the js to work haha http://jsfiddle.net/ZyNMc/ any ideas? the strip of images are supposed to scroll right upon scroll (kinda paralax)
[10:17:34] <shoky> zfly9: that plugin (or that version of the plugin) doesn't support jquery 1.9+
[10:18:21] <zfly9> ah thanks
[10:19:34] <zfly9> ok so I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/ZyNMc/2/ using scollorama for a paralx effect... It's working like I want but not sure why it drops off at the end and doesn't just scroll up after its done sliding to the left..
[10:24:39] <shoky> zfly9: i don't know how to use that plugin, but looking at its code, it's doing really nasty stuff, treating the global jQuery (or $) as if it were its own object
[10:25:26] <zfly9> shoky, I'm trying to get a similar effect of http://wildbluetech.com/
[10:25:37] <shoky> for example it's adding a 'settings' property to $
[10:25:42] <shoky> so now you've got $.settings
[10:25:44] <shoky> wtf
[10:26:53] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: You can do body.about a.about { font-weight: bold; } to mark being active
[10:26:55] <shoky> $.scrollorama = function(options) {  var scrollorama = this
[10:26:57] <shoky> so wrong
[10:27:59] <pythonsnake>  var row = $('<tr class="template-download fade"><i class="z"/></tr>')
[10:28:11] <pythonsnake> how do I select .z in $row?
[10:28:41] <shoky> .find('.z')
[10:28:50] <pythonsnake> thx
[10:29:06] <shoky> or..  var z = $('<i class="z"/>'); var row = $('<tr>').append(z);
[10:29:44] <Rainb> How do you add info to the clipboard when copying?
[10:30:49] <BillCriswell> Rainb: I think flash is the safest bet as of now sadly.
[10:31:26] <BillCriswell> Rainb: https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboard seems to be the go to.
[10:31:30] <Rainb> Uhhm I wonder how come Google Docs does it and it doesn't load flash.. at all
[10:31:58] <pythonsnake> (a ? b:c)
[10:32:08] <pythonsnake> if c is something like '' is that neat?
[10:32:14] <BillCriswell> Rainb: You sure it doesn't?
[10:32:35] <Rainb> I deactivated plugins on chrome, does that count?
[10:32:43] <VSiskos> jeremy sorry about that.  I had updated textual and didn't reopen it
[10:33:18] <BillCriswell> Rainb: I'd imagine. I was genuinely interested. Would like a flashless approach.
[10:33:35] <shoky> pythonsnake:  neat?
[10:34:03] <pythonsnake> shoky: like (a ? 'test' : '')
[10:34:08] <pythonsnake> is it something you guys do?
[10:34:21] <Rainb> Well, check this out.. Open google Docs, insert an Equation, copy it, then see your clipboard
[10:34:32] <shoky> pythonsnake: don't see why not
[10:34:56] <pythonsnake> ok thx
[10:35:32] <Rainb> pythonsnake http://help.hipchat.com/forums/138883-suggestions/suggestions/2765921-ability-to-edit-messages-after-sending for s/tyop/typo
[10:35:53] <Rainb> some IRC clients allows you to "edit" the messages
[10:36:38] <shoky> ...
[10:36:39] <zfly9> So I understand the plugin isn't following the rules... but can anyone tell me why it does what its supposed to do, then jumps down? http://jsfiddle.net/ZyNMc/3/
[10:38:05] <BillCriswell> Rainb: Not sure I'm following these. Also not really the greatest with a spreadsheet lol
[10:38:21] <BillCriswell> I tried =SUM(A1,A2)
[10:39:14] <shoky> Rainb: when i try to copy... i get a popup: Copying and pasting requires the free Google Drive web app. This lets us access your clipboard so you can cut, copy and paste.
[10:39:29] <Rainb> Well, try with Documents ("Google Word")
[10:39:36] <shoky> Rainb: so that's how it works..
[10:39:51] <BillCriswell> shoky: That's pretty damn interesting.
[10:39:53] <Rainb> I don't have the drive web app.. I think..
[10:40:05] <Rainb> Maybe because this is chromium
[10:40:14] <Rainb> Then that explains it
[10:41:33] <BillCriswell> I wonder what the big deal is about just letting the clipboard be write only.
[10:41:52] <BillCriswell> I'd imagine that wouldn't be unsafe?
[10:42:40] <Rainb> Clipboard is read only actually
[10:42:50] <Rainb> like when you "paste"
[10:44:01] <Rainb> Now I need to find an online editor
[10:44:14] <Rainb> I mean an editor
[10:45:56] <jugstah> notepad++
[10:55:52] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/kjybX/7/ - can anyone tell me how I can refactor the code to only allow one to be toggled at a time?
[10:56:17] <jugstah> ie: if i touch another item, the previous item will close
[10:56:52] <Rainb> Is there any possible way to import latex to google Docs
[10:58:43] <myosotis> latex2*, then import into google docs?
[10:58:47] <Rainb> jugstah: well, you can just, use the same event where you open an item to check any previous items open, and "close" them
[10:59:14] <myosotis> I see latex2html, latex2rtf in the ubuntu repos base on my 5 seconds of research...
[10:59:16] <Rainb> myosotis:  yeah
[10:59:38] <Rainb> No I mean using the google docs "Equations" thigy
[11:00:18] <jugstah> Rainb- with toggle?
[11:01:18] <Rainb> jugstah: uh, what do you mean?
[11:01:30] <Rainb> jugstah: toggle, to close them?
[11:01:46] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/kjybX/7/
[11:01:57] <jugstah> easier to show than to explain
[11:02:57] <jugstah> errr, that code shd have .click, not .hover
[11:05:02] <rindolf> Rainb: there's xhmlatex
[11:05:08] <rindolf> Rainb: for converting LaTeX to XHTML.
[11:05:21] <Rainb> rindolf: Alright, thank you.
[11:06:14] <fivetanley> Is there anybody at jqcon I can talk about measuring performance with? Ideally in some automated fashion.
[11:33:37] <Bloomberg> Guys!!
[11:33:40] <Bloomberg> nice day

[11:35:43] <Bloomberg> I need show me one notification for each one object in the array
[11:36:04] <Bloomberg> Now is showing one notification with all objects inside
[11:37:25] <nsanden> does anyone have experience with bootstrap wizard https://github.com/VinceG/twitter-bootstrap-wizard#code-examples - according to this, i should be able to use $('#rootwizard').bootstrapWizard('next'); but nothing happens, no console errors, nothing.
[11:39:01] <andres21> anybody here used google charts api before?
[11:40:11] <themic8> I am trying to setup a dialog box, it needs to have the html in the js file and not call a div on the page.  Anyone do this before?
[11:41:00] <Bloomberg> themic8: Test the fancybox.net plugin
[11:41:16] <Bloomberg> http://fancybox.net/
[11:41:48] <themic8> Bloomberg: Thanks I'll give it a shot
[11:42:21] <Bloomberg> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[11:42:23] <Bloomberg> This also
[11:45:35] <themic8> Bloomberg: Can I create a div/text in my js file with  $("#myDialogText").text('this text for the dialog?
[11:46:38] <Bloomberg> What do you nede?
[11:47:36] <themic8> I'm trying to put the div in the javascript file that the dialog would call from the page
[11:49:18] <Bloomberg> do you need to do some with ajax?
[11:49:39] <themic8> My goal is to keep everything in the javascript file
[11:49:53] <themic8> I could almost use alert()
[11:50:09] <themic8> but I need the alert to time out, so then I must use a dialog box
[11:51:24] <themic8> If I didn't need the alert to time out I would have been fine just using the alert()
[11:52:12] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/Y6ubD/
[11:52:34] <Bloomberg> You can use that!
[11:52:47] <themic8> Thanks
[11:52:55] <themic8> Ill see what I can do
[11:53:21] <Bloomberg> Ok
[11:53:27] <Bloomberg> I hope that works for you!!

[11:55:50] <Bloomberg> jedimind: can do you help me?
[11:55:52] <Bloomberg> plz
[11:56:17] <jedimind> nope
[11:57:09] <jedimind> sorry
[12:02:28] <overrider_> I am trying to build a confirmation dialog thingy, and for some reason my callback gets called once for however many times i click my button. http://pastebin.com/HeWvUwE9 Thanks for any insight. I think its because i am attaching an event handler for each time i click, but no idea how to get rid off - tried a lot of things
[12:07:15] <defaultro> how do I refer to this? <input type="radio" name="user_role" value="Operator"/>
[12:07:47] <myosotis> jQuery('input[name=user_role]'); is one way
[12:08:35] <BillCriswell> I'm having way to much fun with placeholder text.
[12:08:40] <defaultro> thanks myosotis
[12:20:19] <gandul> won't this code add a class to its parent li ?
[12:20:21] <gandul> http://pastie.org/8043748
[12:21:33] <Gho5t> should yes
[12:21:36] <Gho5t> show us the html
[12:22:06] <NoiseEee> gandul: why aren't you using css for that?
[12:22:15] <jedimind> huzzah
[12:22:45] <NoiseEee> gandul: and it looks like the parent would actually be an li, does it not?
[12:22:54] <gandul> yes
[12:23:13] <gandul> i want to keep the parent menu highlighted when hoevered on submenu items
[12:23:41] <gandul> so i want to add a class to its parent li..
[12:23:55] <jedimind> why dont you do it without js ?
[12:24:07] <jedimind> i mean you shouldnt really be using js these days for a dropdown menu
[12:24:13] <SinnerNyx> Is there some way to use .on with non-standard DOM elements/events? For example I'm using the embedded youtube player and I'm wondering if there is some way through regular jquery to listen for the onStateChanged event?
[12:24:15] <gandul> usign css ?
[12:24:21] <gandul> what would i do ?
[12:24:33] <gandul> #menu ul li ul:hover > #menu ul li :S
[12:24:34] <jedimind> li:hover > a, li a:hover { something }
[12:24:50] <gandul> thats not what i want
[12:24:54] <jedimind> so you have the same state for hover on the aanchor as the li itself when the nested ul is triggered
[12:25:00] <gandul> i want the parent menu item hightlighted
[12:25:09] <jedimind> which is what li:hover a does
[12:26:04] <Gho5t> hover over children === hover over parent
[12:26:51] <gandul> alright i know that but i my question is why that code isnt working :)
[12:27:09] <jedimind> http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/CjV8C/
[12:27:17] <jedimind> there's a 1 minute example for you
[12:28:26] <gandul> i thought i was in jquery channel, my question in why that doesn't work anyways nvm huh lol
[12:28:51] <NoiseEee> gandul: show a case on jsfiddle and we can examine
[12:29:19] <jedimind> its a jquery channel but blindly giving you a "solution" to something that is the wrong approach is probably not in your best interest
[12:29:28] <jedimind> sometimes the best solution is no jquery at all :)
[12:31:06] <defaultro> how do I include value="Operator to @$(':input[name=user_role]').prop('disabled', true)
[12:31:46] <Gho5t> gandul: http://jsfiddle.net/zZbRF/
[12:32:37] <Gho5t> defaultro: what
[12:32:39] <defaultro> how do I include value="Operator to @$(':input[name=user_role] :input[value=Operator]').prop('disabled', true)
[12:32:42] <defaultro> will that work?
[12:33:24] <Gho5t> depends on what you're trying to do
[12:33:27] <defaultro> html code is <input type="radio" name="user_role" value="Operator"/>
[12:33:44] <defaultro> i only include name=user_role, other radio buttons gets disabled too
[12:34:02] <defaultro> that's why i like to add value=Operator so only one radio button gets disabled. But i don't know if my format was right
[12:34:04] <Gho5t> $(':input[name=user_role] [value=Operator]')
[12:34:11] <defaultro> cool!! :)
[12:34:13] <defaultro> thanks, trying it now
[12:35:13] <defaultro> it didn't work
[12:35:26] <defaultro> i was still able to check the radio button
[12:37:12] <Gho5t> defaultro: http://jsfiddle.net/DLNqa/2/
[12:37:17] <defaultro> k
[12:37:36] <defaultro> was it because i had spaces between ][
[12:37:43] <Gho5t> yes
[12:38:17] <defaultro> worked!!!!!!! :D
[12:38:21] <defaultro> thanks so much Gho5t
[12:55:50] <FireRogue> hello! I was wondering if theres a way to simplify a DOM using jQuery to strip all attributes and such. (<div class="foo">text</div> -> <div>text</div>)
[12:56:11] <jugstah> .removeclass()
[12:56:24] <FireRogue> but also all the other attributes
[12:56:37] <FireRogue> everything. i just want the actual elements and their contents
[12:56:57] <jugstah> try .removeAttr()?
[12:57:35] <jugstah> $('div').removeAttr('*');
[12:58:03] <defaultro> so I used .prop('disabled', true). How do I prevent users from modifying it in Firebug?
[12:58:51] <NoiseEee> defaultro: you don't / can't
[12:59:34] <FireRogue> jugstah: returned an invalid char exception
[13:03:10] <defaultro> oh, NoiseEee :(
[13:03:30] <defaultro> what is the real world approach to it? Remove it from our template?
[13:04:20] <NoiseEee> i suppose, it depends on what your needs are
[13:04:31] <NoiseEee> you can always choose to ignore it on the backend for whatever reason
[13:12:48] <malorie> can someone recommend me a customizable lightbox plugin?
[13:14:42] <NoiseEee> arent they all?
[13:15:03] <malorie> lightbox2 doesn't seem to be customizable very easily, for example
[13:15:21] <malorie> and I don't have any experiences with any of the available clones
[13:15:22] <NoiseEee> well what does 'customizable' mean to you?
[13:15:27] <graphettion> malorie: http://codegeekz.com/best-jquery-lightbox-plugins-for-developers/
[13:15:36] <malorie> styling, mostly
[13:15:39] <jugstah> different strokes for different folks
[13:15:40] <graphettion> Yeah, NoiseEee has a point. It's whatever tailors to your needs.
[13:15:47] <myosotis> with some simple css knowledge I've found that it's just as easy to create your own lightbox whenever you need to use one as it is to use a pre-built one
[13:16:13] <myosotis> or use the jQuery ui modal dialog if I'm already using jqueryui
[13:16:30] <NoiseEee> malorie: you should be able to manipulate/change or add on your own styles fairly easily?
[13:16:33] <graphettion> Unless you want to make an excuse to download a bunch of unneeded styles and markup.
[13:16:36] <graphettion> ;)
[13:16:39] <SinnerNyx> Is there some way to use .on with non-standard DOM elements/events? For example I'm using the embedded youtube player and I'm wondering if there is some way through regular jquery to listen for the onStateChanged event?
[13:16:44] <jugstah> i use fancybox whenever i can, familiarity breeds contempt.
[13:16:56] <graphettion> (example: prototype and no time)
[13:17:23] <malorie> NoiseEee: it's possible, for sure. but not fairly easily. so I'm looking for alternatives
[13:18:32] <malorie> jugstah: how hard is it to make your own .css for fancybox?
[13:19:37] <jugstah> no idea, malorie. whats hard for you might be easy for another.
[13:20:10] <jugstah> try it..
[13:20:20] <malorie> ok :-)
[13:20:43] <FireRogue> I wrote a while loop to do what i needed
[13:23:32] <jugstah> mind you, im no jquery ninja :-)
[13:25:40] <hugo_moss> how do i attach an event handler to a button, where the button is not loaded until a remote url is injected into a modal, and this is after the dom is ready?
[13:26:52] <myosotis> you attach an event handler to an element above your target in the dom hierarchy that *is* going to be there
[13:26:58] <NoiseEee> $(someParentOfButtonThatExistsAtPageLoad).on('click','button.theClassNameIfDesired',function(){})
[13:27:04] <myosotis> jQuery(document).on('click', 'target-element-selector', function() {});
[13:28:43] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/kjybX/17/ - this works great except when I click on the .bubble_lg, it doesnt do anything.. any ideas?
[13:30:06] <hugo_moss> i can use the 'change' event
[13:30:12] <hugo_moss> .on('change')
[13:30:21] <NoiseEee> hugo_moss: buttons don't change.
[13:30:33] <hugo_moss> but the injected html does inside a modal
[13:30:42] <hugo_moss> thats when the button is added
[13:30:44] <NoiseEee> hugo_moss: that's now what the 'change' event is about.
[13:30:55] <NoiseEee> your question has been answered hugo_moss!
[13:31:02] <NoiseEee> hugo_moss:  $(someParentOfButtonThatExistsAtPageLoad).on('click','button.theClassNameIfDesired',function(){})
[13:31:20] <hugo_moss> oh
[13:31:22] <hugo_moss> cool
[13:31:23] <hugo_moss> thanks
[13:31:48] <hugo_moss> thanks sir
[13:32:10] <SinnerNyx> In my case the "on" function doesn't work. How would I bind to statechanged in a cross-browser compatible way? http://jsfiddle.net/PffTP/

[13:33:19] <jugstah> glad i was able to help
[13:36:14] <Wescotte> Anyone here know how to build a POST for a Google Fusion Tables query? I'm able to perform a SELECT statement and get the results but when I change the query to INSERT or UPDATE it says it can't process these by GET but I chagned type: "POST" so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong...
[13:37:34] <SinnerNyx> Sorry, the "on" function that doesn't work for me is on line 26 of the linked javascript section. How would I bind an eventlistener on the 'statechanged' event of an embedded youtube video player? http://jsfiddle.net/PffTP/2/
[13:38:01] <Wescotte> Or.. How can I output exactly what my POST is sending so I can compare it to a working version I get from https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/fusiontables/v1/fusiontables.query.sql
[13:38:27] <andres21> anybody here uses highcharts?
[13:39:28] <hugo_moss> worked like a charm noisee
[13:39:31] <hugo_moss> thanks
[13:43:19] <jugstah> are there other jquery groups on other networks other than on freenode?
[13:44:12] <SinnerNyx> jugstah: I imagine so, but this is the "official" one
[13:46:07] <jugstah> cool... just wondered... having a little issue with my jquery that im certain would take one of you jquery-fiends 5 seconds to answer
[13:46:08] <jugstah> :-)
[13:48:50] <shoky> jugstah: you'll need to state it if you want help ;p
[13:49:42] <jugstah> shoky- i'll re-state.
[13:49:57] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/kjybX/17/
[13:50:22] <jugstah> if I click and "show".. the "showing" element when clicked doesn't "hide"
[13:51:10] <digitalmediaguy> Does anyone have a code example for $.get with a url and a datatype?
[13:51:23] <digitalmediaguy> trying to figure out the darn syntax
[13:51:36] <digitalmediaguy> none of the examples I found have a datatype example
[13:51:56] <shoky> jugstah: you're adding a click handler on $(this).find('.bubble_lg')   every time the li is clicked
[13:52:38] <shoky> jugstah: also  $(this) inside that nested click handler refers to the .bubble_lg element, not the li. so you can't do .find('.bubble_lg') on it
[13:53:13] <digitalmediaguy> http://pastebin.com/M0xiyc6c
[13:53:24] <digitalmediaguy> is this how I would set it to jsonp ?
[13:53:32] <eddiemonge> if i have a static site, whats the best/good way to handle sessions when talking to a rest api? specifically looking to prevent csrf
[13:54:23] <jugstah> hmm
[13:54:51] <eddiemonge> digitalmediaguy: yes but jsonp needs to be in quotes
[13:56:46] <digitalmediaguy> so what I am really trying to solve is an error that says https://mysite.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[13:56:53] <shoky> jugstah: also your html has:   <pBOX2</p>
[13:57:16] <digitalmediaguy> I read that setting jsonp as the dataType might fix it‚Ä¶ apparently not ;-?
[13:57:34] <shoky> digitalmediaguy:  the server has to support jsonp for it to work
[13:57:45] <digitalmediaguy> any other suggestions?
[13:58:23] <shoky> digitalmediaguy: if the server doesn't support jsonp or CORS then there's not much you can do except make your own server-side proxy
[13:58:54] <digitalmediaguy> roger
[13:59:05] <jugstah> got the typo ok
[13:59:17] <eddiemonge> digitalmediaguy: is it not your server?

[14:01:25] <GabrielR> Have an ajax related problem.  I'm using the Postscribe library to load ads. Simulates document write and uses javascript to inject the ad into the page. When ithas finished injectung the new html into the page it calls my function.  The problem looking for a child elemnt immediately jquery can't find it.
[14:01:51] <GabrielR> $('#pooop img")  return hull.  But if I use a timeout to wait a couple of seconds, jquery finds it
[14:02:46] <SinnerNyx> The "on" function on line 26 doesn't work for me. How would I bind an eventlistener on the 'statechanged' event of an embedded youtube video player? http://jsfiddle.net/PffTP/2/
[14:02:49] <GabrielR> Any idea how to either inspect this live data that hasn't been process by the dom yet?  Or, a way to set a listener on a div so when the html contents of that element change, it triggers my code?
[14:03:03] <NoiseEee> GabrielR: sounds like you're not using a callback?
[14:03:37] <GabrielR> NoiseEee:  it does have a cal back.  The problem is Postscribe doesn't use jquery and it's a close library, so I can modify it
[14:04:10] <GabrielR> the callback execuites when the html injection finished. It doesn't wait for the browser to load them
[14:04:59] <NoiseEee> GabrielR: so you might be done to using a timeout
[14:05:56] <GabrielR> yea, I was trying that but it's no good.  If the connection is too slow it'll fail.   I may have to loop a timeout.  So keep checking once a second until it loads
[14:08:39] <GabrielR> oh ho!  This guy wrote a little plugin that watches for changes to page elements in the dom.  kind of like the jquery change() function, but works on anything

[14:10:50] <jugstah> have a great weekend,f olks.
[14:11:54] <dabear> GabrielR: maybe livequery could work better for you. also, it doesn't use setinterval
[14:12:16] <GabrielR> oohh, livequery.  Don't know that one. Thanks I'll check it out.
[14:14:08] <GabrielR> dabear:   hmm, hasn't been updated since 2009
[14:15:16] <dabear> GabrielR: newer version here: http://plugins.jquery.com/livequery/
[14:16:34] <GabrielR> dabear:  thanks. I was searching for livequery not live query.
[14:19:00] <eddiemonge> sounds more like angulars two way data binding
[14:19:30] <Wescotte> Converting my XHR to jquery... $.ajax({ url: url, type: "POST", ....}) is showing up as GET in console->network.. Any ideas why?
[14:19:58] <shoky> Wescotte: what's the ....?
[14:20:05] <shoky> Wescotte: and what's the url
[14:20:32] <eddiemonge> Wescotte: whats the full code?
[14:23:46] <Wescotte> http://pastebin.ca/2398999 <--- Here is the block. I removed my tableID and key values but otherwise it's a copy/paste from my code
[14:24:25] <shoky> Wescotte: JSONP is always a GET request
[14:24:42] <shoky> Wescotte: JSONP means a <script> element is injected into the page
[14:24:57] <shoky> and <script>'s are fetched using GET
[14:25:22] <shoky> also.. that url is.. odd ;]
[14:26:26] <Wescotte> shoky: how is it odd?
[14:26:48] <shoky> it has spaces in it.. and SQL in it. :(
[14:27:14] <shoky> but that's irrelevant to the jsonp anyways
[14:27:57] <eddiemonge> Wescotte: please tell me that string isnt read directly into a query
[14:28:11] <eddiemonge> but its on googleapis so thats weird
[14:29:09] <Wescotte> shoky: That's how Google Fusion API works I guess...  I can't find any other way to do it.
[14:29:52] <shoky> Wescotte: yeah i see that https://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v1/sql-reference    weird shit
[14:30:03] <Wescotte> eddiemonge: I don't follow...
[14:32:41] <dorgan> is there a way to turn off other handlers for a given element, and then say turn them back on
[14:33:06] <shoky> ?off
[14:33:08] <bot-t> shoky, .off() | jQuery API Documentation - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[14:33:29] <dorgan> I've tried a one() handler with a e.stopImmediatePropagation but that doesnt seem to be working
[14:34:15] <dorgan> mean i need to highjack what a button is doing, but only on the first click
[14:34:44] <dorgan> is there a way to do that?
[14:35:39] <shoky> do what, exactly?
[14:35:44] <dorgan> hmm actually i am thinkink of hiding the original button and putting a new one in and then using trigger
[14:38:09] <Wescotte> shoky: thanks! removing JSONP resolved my issue.
[14:39:13] <FireRogue> I need to wrap one element inside another (<li><div><!-- stuff --></div></li> -> <li><a><div><!-- stuff --></div></a></li>)

[14:39:41] <FireRogue> well that was easy :P
[14:40:25] <tw2113> shoky had to think for a whole 5 seconds to come up with the answer
[14:41:12] <FireRogue> I'm sorry... I've been working on this for far too long, and people in other channels that were relevant at different parts of this project were being assholes, so im not really up for much right now
[14:41:13] <shoky> think what i could achieve if i think for 30
[14:41:56] <tw2113> FireRogue, i'm on your side
[14:42:03] <tw2113> just also highly sarcastic :)
[14:42:16] <shoky> other channels... pfft
[14:42:20] <blindMoe> hehe
[14:42:23] <FireRogue> over the internet its sometimes difficult to tell the difference
[14:42:23] <blindMoe> nice conversation to come back to
[14:43:00] <FireRogue> I was staring at this for forever and it just refused to work. i was linking to a non-<a> id, so the browser opened a new page because technically it's not an anchor
[14:43:38] <FireRogue> so now i have to wrap every single div i'd ever have to link to in an <a> in order to properly jump around the page
[14:43:39] <blindMoe> happy friday everyone
[14:43:52] <blindMoe> hrmm well that went in the wrong channel but I guess it applies here as well
[14:44:07] <shoky> seems to be friday here too

[15:43:58] <BlaDe^> hi guys, I feel this is a dumb question however: http://pastie.org/private/9akiglhku8iapmpyu3cv2w
[15:44:08] <BlaDe^> datatype is json but it's sending formdata username=&password=
[15:44:59] <systemfault> BlaDe^: jQuery doesn't know how to send json properly, it always uses form data
[15:45:19] <systemfault> BlaDe^: You can still do it by setting the contentType and setting processData to false, IIRC
[15:45:43] <systemfault> BlaDe^: But you'll need to stringify the objet to JSON yourself‚Ä¶ using JSON.stringify(theObject)
[15:46:07] <BlaDe^> I see, that's kinda lame
[16:00:42] <crunchbang> jquery is good
[16:15:02] <delinquentme> $.each is moar of an operation for KV pairs than for an array right?
[16:18:00] <systemfault> delinquentme: both
[16:18:49] <systemfault> $.each([1,2,3,4], function(){ var value = this;  });    $.each({foo: 1, bar: 2}, function(key, value) {});
[16:18:55] <delinquentme> merits of using .indexOf() vrs $.inArray  ??
[16:19:16] <delinquentme> not " jquery for jquery sake"
[16:19:20] <systemfault> delinquentme: indexOf doesn't work on shitty browsers.
[16:19:27] <systemfault> Like ie7 and ie8
[16:19:28] <delinquentme> oic
[16:19:30] <delinquentme> +1
[16:20:07] <systemfault> When you see functionalities that duplicates existing ones in jQuery.. it's usually because of old browsers
[16:20:31] <delinquentme> im assuming systemfault that .indexOf() would be fastar though?
[16:20:42] <systemfault> It's native, so of course.
[16:21:05] <systemfault> jQuery is probably clever enough to call .indexOf on implementations that has it.
[16:22:15] <Rejected> I'm trying to use an AJAX call to fetch the content of a div in another page and display it in the current page. The problem is, the content of the div I'm selecting isn't getting returned to the calling page. Here's the code: http://pastie.org/private/9adfoepwc3za05ijcysaqq. Also, I'm extremely noob with jQuery, mind you, so excuse any obvious mistake that I might be doing.
[16:22:44] <systemfault> delinquentme: Array.prototype.forEach == $.each, Array.prototype.map = $.map, JSON.parse = $.parseJSON, Array.prototype.filter = $.grep‚Ä¶. etc.. etc..
[16:30:22] <Rejected> http://pastie.org/private/zaplbkzggtvwnkr6cv76eq here's the actual code I have now, misplaced a .find for a .filter in the previous one
[16:39:28] <shoky> Rejected: what're you trying to do, and why are you doing it like that?  also.. what's the problem?
[16:46:28] <delinquentme> can $.inArray be used to search for an input array ... within an array of arrays?
[16:47:45] <shoky> delinquentme: by reference, sure
[16:48:38] <delinquentme> shoky, I dont follow?
[16:49:11] <systemfault> delinquentme: That means no except in one case.
[16:49:28] <shoky> delinquentme:  only if the input array is actually in the array of arrays
[16:49:42] <shoky> the input array itself, not another array which happens to be identical
[16:49:51] <tomivs> How to apply a script to each classes but one at a time?
[16:49:58] <shoky> that is.. === should be true for them
[16:50:26] <systemfault> tomivs: Only one thing can happen at the same time in JS...
[16:50:41] <systemfault> Ah‚Ä¶ nvm
[16:50:42] <shoky> delinquentme: and..  var a = [1,2]; var b = [1,2];   here a !== b
[16:50:56] <systemfault> tomivs: Well, is there a way to discriminate it?
[16:51:56] <delinquentme> http://jsfiddle.net/a63nD/
[16:51:56] <tomivs> systemfault, http://jsfiddle.net/sjsPw/
[16:52:16] <delinquentme> shoky, I think it is ... check it out: v
[16:52:17] <delinquentme> http://jsfiddle.net/a63nD/
[16:52:25] <shoky> delinquentme:  right. asdf is not the same array as the one you put in dingo
[16:52:35] <shoky> delinquentme: they just happen to be "identical"
[16:52:52] <shoky> delinquentme: $.inArray/indexOf  won't help you here
[16:53:07] <shoky> delinquentme:  only here  http://jsfiddle.net/a63nD/1/
[16:53:34] <delinquentme> wat.
[16:53:36] <systemfault> tomivs: You want CSS if you simply need mouseover
[16:53:59] <delinquentme> what if I want to evaluate not as the obj id but instead the values of say each index of the array
[16:54:05] <shoky> ?js var a = [1,2,3], b = [1,2,3];   a === b
[16:54:08] <bot-t1> shoky: false
[16:54:10] <shoky> delinquentme ^
[16:54:26] <delinquentme> ?js var a = [1,2,3], b = [1,2,3];   a == b
[16:54:26] <bot-t1> delinquentme: false
[16:54:33] <shoky> ?js var a = [1,2,3], b = a;   a === b
[16:54:33] <bot-t1> shoky: true
[16:54:35] <delinquentme> bot-t1 you are wrong!
[16:54:44] <shoky> he's not ;p
[16:54:46] * delinquentme lebleh
[16:55:25] <delinquentme> sooo like how do search for ["alme","hoops"] within [[]]
[16:55:39] <delinquentme> *surely* theres a codebase out there for dis noe?
[16:56:21] <shoky> delinquentme: you'd have to loop through the array and compare each item in it
[16:56:25] <tomivs> systemfault, I want: onmouse over "element": change color of letters
[16:56:39] <delinquentme> shoky, this is sooo manual!
[16:57:24] <shoky> delinquentme: only until you've written a function which does it for any 2 arrays. then you can use it and it works "automatically"
[16:57:29] <tomivs> systemfault, is implossible in CSS
[16:58:09] <shoky> delinquentme: and yes i'm sure you can find code that does it already and use it without manually writing up your own
[16:58:37] <delinquentme> underscore js does single level elements
[17:06:04] <sodapop> how can i scroll a modal to bottom automatically and not the background page
[17:15:04] <RandalSchwartz> in an old UI tabs widget, I used: fx: [{ opacity: 'hide' }, {opacity: 'show'}],
[17:15:08] <RandalSchwartz> what's the modern equivalent?
[17:15:24] <RandalSchwartz> something with show:, hide:
[17:15:27] <RandalSchwartz> but I can't quite make it out
[17:16:17] <mr-iop> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-show
[17:16:27] <mr-iop> RandalSchwartz
[17:16:37] <RandalSchwartz> I see that.  trying to figure out how to map this to that
[17:17:17] <RandalSchwartz> ahh.  maybe just a duration
[17:17:27] <RandalSchwartz> as in show: 1, hide: 1 ?
[17:17:48] <RandalSchwartz> all I wanted was a fade in/out
[17:20:50] <sodapop> can i avoid page jump when i load new content in a div with html()?
[17:21:55] <delinquentme> shoky this inArray operation makes me mad
[17:21:59] <RandalSchwartz> Ahh yes, that does it
[17:22:25] <RandalSchwartz> actually... show: true, hide: true makes it use the default fade... what I already had

[18:37:35] <tw2113> yeah, they're too good for js

[20:22:53] <shoky> andres21:  you don't have a 'val' property in your "json", for starters..

[20:35:27] <sorbo_> tried setTimeout and .delay(), no dice so far
[20:53:38] <shoky> sorbo_: it's a css transition, you can just change the duration in css
[21:07:49] <sorbo_> shoky: gave that a shot, but not quite what I'm looking for. I guess a better question is: how can I force the modal to wait 5 seconds before opening after its link is clicked?
[21:08:05] <sorbo_> that's what I was monkeying around with setTimeout and delay() for
[21:08:06] <b-lew> is there a way to say after the first 2 items wrap the next 4 with a div?
[21:10:25] <Eviltwin> b-lew: .slice(...).wrapAll(...)
[21:10:46] <b-lew> ah slice ‚Ä¶ lets google that :) thanks!
[21:14:11] <Eviltwin> b-lew: http://jsfiddle.net/CngUk/
[21:14:26] <Eviltwin> b-lew: see http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[21:14:54] <b-lew> yep checking it out now.
[21:14:59] <b-lew> thank you!
[21:17:34] <b-lew> Eviltwin: is there a way to keep wrapping every 4 elements after the 1st 4? until it stops?
[21:17:51] <b-lew> need to create a loop i think
[21:19:48] <Eviltwin> b-lew: That needs a loop for sure
[21:20:15] <Eviltwin> It should be pretty simple. Want to take a crack at it yourself first?
[21:21:14] <b-lew> yea Trying it now.
[21:24:44] <andres21> shoky:  thanks for the help and sorry for the delay.. do you know if theres a way to pass a string in the status?
[21:27:08] <b-lew> hummm I'm having an issue wrapping my head around this one. http://jsfiddle.net/anWmF/
[21:27:43] <Eviltwin> You have .slice(i, i+2) which means it's selecting two elements there
[21:27:46] <Eviltwin> Is that what you want?
[21:28:22] <shoky> andres21: not sure what you mean
[21:28:28] <b-lew> no I want to slice it after the first 2 then every 4th element I want it to wrap a div around it.
[21:28:40] <Eviltwin> b-lew: Give you a hint
[21:28:46] <b-lew> :)
[21:28:47] <Eviltwin> You'll want to change what i starts at then
[21:29:25] <andres21> shoky:  http://jsfiddle.net/SREcf/22/
[21:29:37] <Eviltwin> And you're going to want .slice(i, i+4)
[21:29:41] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/anWmF/1/
[21:29:47] <b-lew> :)
[21:29:52] <b-lew> right?
[21:29:57] <b-lew> wow thats sweet
[21:30:15] <shoky> andres21: that doesn't make any sense.. how do you expect to get a graph without any numbers..?
[21:31:22] <shoky> andres21: oh i see, repeating statuses. no idea, never used that plugin
[21:31:37] <andres21> shoky:  yes
[21:31:56] <andres21> thats why i was wondering how to pass a string instead a value
[21:32:11] <andres21> shoky:  you use any particular chart library?
[21:32:34] <shoky> andres21: you could pretty easily build up an array with the proper numbers from your statuses
[21:32:50] <shoky> andres21: not really, haven't needed any yet
[21:34:01] <b-lew> Thanks Eviltwin. Works great!
[21:34:04] <andres21> shoky:  actually i recieve the numbers in the json but the idea is to convert each number in a status like "Completed" etc
[21:40:34] <shoky> andres21: not really sure what output you're looking for.. here's something http://jsfiddle.net/SREcf/23/
[21:41:59] <andres21> shoky:  that really make sense only is not showing the services labels
[21:42:40] <shoky> where should they show.. and how come you have a service that's both In Progress and also Completed..
[21:46:02] <shoky> anyways if you understand both of my fiddles that should be enough to get you going on however you want it to look
[21:46:06] <andres21> shoky:  in the tooltip i guess there should be a way to show both services completed
[21:46:18] <andres21> shoky:  ill find that out
[21:46:19] <shoky> you guess there should be a way..
[21:50:33] <andres21> shoky:  thanks for the help by the way
[21:51:50] <shoky> np
[22:05:10] <andres21> shoky:  just a last question.. given this example.. is it possible to change the status of the json  with a switch statement or something like that?

[23:54:12] <zeromodulus> does the order in which you include a javascript file matter?
[23:54:49] <Eviltwin> zeromodulus: It controls the order in which they're executed
[23:54:54] <Eviltwin> So for example
[23:55:13] <zeromodulus> i.e. if you reference b in a.js and a.js loads before b.js, would b in a.js be undefined?
[23:55:23] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:55:33] <zeromodulus> ah, okay.
