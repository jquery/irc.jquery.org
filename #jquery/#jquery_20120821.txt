[00:13:23] <jalexandru> hi, I need help with .focus() I need to give an input text box focus but when I do it with .focus() the cursor jumps in front of the text inside of the textbox in firefox, I need the cursor to be at the end of the text so the user can erase the text with ctrl+backspace anybody have any solutions???
[00:27:48] <Asone> yo
[00:29:07] <ak> how can i check, if some object's prototype has a property?
[00:39:31] <mllie> hello
[00:39:49] <Clex> ak: obj.prop !== undefined
[00:40:32] <mllie> how do I select all li:s that has a direct-child div?
[00:42:02] <Clex> mllie: $("li").has("div")
[00:46:41] <mllie> Clex: doesn't that get li:s with div that is not first-level child?
[00:48:52] <tw2113> $('li > div')
[00:49:34] <Clex> That gets all <li> which have a direct <div> child I believe.
[00:49:46] <mllie> tw2113: but that is not has? li:has(> div) maybe?
[00:50:02] <tw2113> The expression $('div:has(p)') matches a <div> if a <p> exists anywhere among its descendants, not just as a direct child.
[00:50:06] <Clex> tw2113: this hoever selects children.
[00:50:48] <tw2113> which made me find http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[00:53:37] <guy> How to remove elected elements and get them in a new set?
[00:54:28] <guy> Like, if I have "<tr /><tr /><tr class="a" /><tr class="a" /><tr />", I want to remove the tr.a and have a variable that holds the removed elements.
[00:54:32] <tw2113> i'd loop through the set and assign the ones you want to create to a new array
[00:56:20] <LordThumper> guy: var a = $("tr.a"); $("tr.a").remove();
[00:57:06] <dialman> How about .detach()? That will return the detached elements and you can do what you like with them
[00:57:08] <guy> That would not work.
[00:57:30] <guy> I just did. var a = $("tr.a").clone(); $("tr.a").remove();
[00:57:39] <LordThumper> or just var a = $("tr.a")
[00:57:42] <LordThumper> or just var a = $("tr.a").remove() *
[00:58:02] <Clex> guy: appendTo
[00:58:52] <guy> It is actually this question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12049858/how-to-move-a-row-to-the-top-of-the-table/12049941
[00:59:48] <guy> but now I am completely lost...
[00:59:49] <guy> data.filter('tr.ay-sort-top').remove();
[00:59:54] <LordThumper> Yeah, did you try prependTo ?
[01:00:05] <guy> doesn't remove the <tr> but console.log(data.filter('tr.ay-sort-top')) finds it
[01:00:16] <LordThumper> $("tr.a")
[01:00:21] <LordThumper> That selects your rows
[01:00:33] <LordThumper> So $("#tableid tr.a")
[01:00:43] <LordThumper> $("#tableid tr.a").prependTo("#tableid")
[01:01:03] <LordThumper> That moves your rows to the top of the table
[01:01:27] <guy> LordThumper: Ok, we are not on the same page. I am talking about one data selector, you are talking about different scenario
[01:01:40] <guy> This is the code though https://dev.anuary.com/394fde3c-fa43-594f-9e67-58578a7f24ba/public/js/jquery.ay-table-sort.js
[01:01:47] <guy> see line data.filter('tr.ay-sort-top').remove();
[01:02:50] <LordThumper> Well then just replace the selector, it is pretty obvious
[01:03:14] <guy> ..
[01:03:31] <LordThumper> $(data).filter("tr.ay-sort-top").prependTo("#tableid")
[01:04:05] <LordThumper> As data is a jQuery object just:
[01:04:18] <LordThumper> data.filter("tr.ay-sort-top").prependTo("#tableid")
[01:09:23] <LordThumper> guy: .remove() doesn't work if element is not in DOM
[01:09:45] <guy> what about insertBefore?
[01:10:24] <guy> Thank you. That was the catch. LordThumper.
[01:11:07] <letweet> http://jsfiddle.net/JFw3J/1/            <<< have I done my hover wrong?
[01:13:17] <LordThumper> guy: Yes it should work
[01:13:18] <LordThumper> Np
[01:19:46] <jmaister> letweet: You have img#tooltip, but you are trying to show the tooltip on an anchor.
[01:20:35] <bigLanky> yeah
[01:20:42] <bigLanky> just tkae out img and it works
[01:23:00] <letweet> hahaha thanks jmaister that's what happens when you adapt code...
[01:23:50] <Guest2409> Hello, I have a problem using before()/after() functions. I want to add a row before another, $(old).before(new_), when I do it through the chrome console it works fine but with my script it add the new row at the top of the table. I cannot understand with its working in console and not in my script. If someone has a clue.
[01:28:20] <letweet> jmaister, the code works fine in jsfiddle, now I've updated, but when I try on my page, I get "Unexpected token ILLEGAL" on the very last line in the jquery
[01:30:27] <Mento> Hey guys, I want to animate a group of DIV's by a value I get. E.G. my value = 55%. Than i want a .boom-10 to animate till .boom-60 by the steps of .boom-10/20/30/40/50 ... not sure if any gets it... but heres what I mean: http://jsfiddle.net/fQcwQ/2/
[01:33:45] <letweet> http://jsfiddle.net/JFw3J/3/          <<< this isn't working now :(
[01:35:17] <letweet> basically all I'm looking to do here is show the tooltip on mousein and hide it again onmouseout
[01:39:32] <nail_> letweet: remove your script tag in the jsfiddle
[01:42:31] <hlve> hey guys, anyone awakes?
[01:45:03] <letweet> nail_, once again I derp :/ ... but why does it work in jsfiddle and not on my page?
[01:45:46] <letweet> hmmm might actually be a problem with my reference to the library
[01:46:50] <letweet> or not...
[01:47:47] <hlve> my issue is probably simple. i'm trying to make my .each fires off only on a tags that have an href that includes jpg, gif, png, or jpeg.
[01:47:48] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/gTFuN/1/
[01:47:50] <hlve> o_o
[01:49:10] <Clex> hlve: try a regex.
[01:49:23] <hlve> it's a greasemonkey script so it's a little tricky. lol.
[01:50:21] <nail_> letweet: is it wrapped in a $(document).ready() on your page?
[01:50:37] <letweet> nail_, no... it should be?
[01:50:38] <hlve> got it. kinda.
[01:51:03] <nail_> letweet: yes
[01:51:48] <dipser> ".media-preview[href*=png]" ?
[01:52:06] <hlve> have that, but how would I make it apply to png, gif, jpeg, and jpg?
[01:52:12] <hlve> would I need 4 different regexes?
[01:52:53] <juha_>  ".media-preview[href*=png], .media-preview[href*=gif],.media-preview[href*=jpg],.media-preview[href*=jpeg]" maybe?
[01:53:12] <jmaister> letweet: check this out http://jsfiddle.net/JFw3J/6/
[01:54:09] <hlve> ah that did it
[01:54:11] <hlve> thanks juha_ :)
[01:55:05] <jmaister> letweet: or even: http://jsfiddle.net/JFw3J/8/
[01:55:33] <juha_> hlve: no problems
[01:56:06] <letweet> wrapping it in $(document).ready() didn't help :/
[01:56:47] <letweet> the jquery is fine, but it won't load on my page for some reason :/
[01:56:56] <jmaister> check the console for errors
[01:57:26] <tocka> mornign
[01:57:28] <letweet> jmaister, Uncaught syntax error Unexpected token ILLEGAL .. Chrome highlights the last line in the jquery
[01:57:34] <tocka> how can I add inline styling to a div element?
[01:58:01] <jmaister> tocka: why would you want to do that?
[01:58:04] <Guest2409> clear: both ?
[01:58:05] <letweet> tocka, use .attr
[01:58:25] <tocka> jmaister slider is blocking the view of a dropdown
[01:58:46] <jmaister> damn slider >:|
[01:58:55] <letweet> tocka, I assume this is what you mean by "addin inline styling"? -> $(".class").attr("style", "display: block; height: 100px;");
[01:59:07] <tocka> yep
[01:59:09] <tocka> thanks <3
[01:59:20] <letweet> :)
[01:59:41] <letweet> imho though, it's not great practice...
[02:00:31] <tocka> as long as it works I'm fine with it :0
[02:00:35] <jmaister> letweet: http://stackoverflow.com/q/5733275/927408
[02:00:37] <tocka> its just a temp solution
[02:02:12] <letweet> jmaister, found the same, but not sure what to do if it's a rogue artifact somewhere...
[02:03:10] <letweet> tocka, what you could do is $(".class").css("display", "block"); $(".class").css("height", "100px"); ... just as a better alternative
[02:04:12] <_fury> Hi, how can i find certain strings on a page? For instance i want to find the string "teststring" in this:
[02:04:25] <_fury> <p>teststring</p>
[02:05:39] <jmaister> letweet: You could use find and replace on some common unsupported characters such as U+200B, U+200C, U+200D, U+200E, U+00AD, U+2060, U+FEFF, U+2061 and U+115F
[02:05:54] <jmaister> Start with highlighting them
[02:06:07] <jmaister> U+200B is probably most likely
[02:07:24] <letweet> does visual studio write those?
[02:07:34] <_fury> sorry for the question. I can do that using contains...
[02:09:17] <jmaister> letweet: I have no idea what kind of crazy stuff visual studio can do
[02:09:28] <letweet> jmaister, you think it could be coz of the paste from jsfiddle?
[02:10:52] <jmaister> that isn't implausible
[02:15:24] <letweet> jmaister and yet, when I deleted the copied code out of jsfiddle and retyped it all, it works...
[02:15:27] <letweet> weird huh
[02:15:44] <letweet> on, isn't implausible... so I guess I found the problem :D
[02:16:27] <jmaister> classic problem
[02:16:50] <jmaister> And you even got a better script
[02:19:43] <Shambat> I have a question about jQuery Flot. What is the option for giving backgound shadow to some areas of the graph?
[02:20:50] <letweet> yup jmaister, I did :) thanks for that
[02:23:53] <xdjuj__> hi :)
[02:24:08] <xdjuj__> I've a problem of DOM with jQuery/Ajax
[02:25:13] <xdjuj__> In a jQuery Droppable, on drop function, I'm using jQuery.getJSON to get some content and generate some HTML that I append to an article
[02:25:34] <xdjuj__> In that HTML, I generate a <a class='delete' … />
[02:25:59] <xdjuj__> This .delete should be triggered by my delete() function
[02:26:08] <xdjuj__> But that's not the case
[02:26:24] <xdjuj__> jQuery(document).on('click','.delete', function(e) {
[02:26:35] <xdjuj__> I'm using on, but not working
[02:26:42] <xdjuj__> Have I missed something ?
[02:29:03] <Clex> Why not $('.delete.').click(function() {}) ?
[02:29:11] <Clex> *.delete sorry
[02:30:45] <xdjuj__> Because I've a DOM problem :)
[02:31:07] <xdjuj__> .on normally should do live+bind
[02:31:27] <xdjuj__> My delete() function is working fine
[02:31:37] <xdjuj__> On all elements .delete present on the HTML source
[02:31:55] <xdjuj__> But not working on my new ".delete" generated with Ajax/jQuery
[02:32:17] <xdjuj__> That's why I'm looking for a DOM problem :)

[03:20:53] <code_ph0y> hey guys .. I have a question
[03:21:33] <code_ph0y> when using ajax ... when using the done() function can you hook a function up and it will load more javascript?
[03:21:42] <code_ph0y> if you get what I mean?
[03:21:52] <code_ph0y> I have an example of what am trying to do
[03:22:14] <code_ph0y> I have done it before with mootools but I can't seem to do it with jquery?
[03:23:31] <xdjuj__> Not sure to understand code_ph0y :)
[03:24:05] <code_ph0y> two secs bud I have an example
[03:24:13] <code_ph0y> http://pastebin.com/h07XX8Ck
[03:24:20] <code_ph0y> thats what am trying to do
[03:24:41] <code_ph0y> should I put the response_functions in complete?
[03:27:30] <xdjuj__> I would do that yes, but I'm not sure :)
[03:27:46] <code_ph0y> nice bud i'll try that then
[03:27:57] <code_ph0y> i'll also try an eval or somethingt
[03:29:26] <veleiro> Can someone assist me with getting the value of an attribute with javascript of a second decendent element? (grandchild element):  <div id="slide1" class="slide"><p><span title="1">.  I've tried to get the "1" like this: document.getElementById("slide"+newcounter).getElementsByTagName("span").getAttribute("title");       But I have no idea what i'm doing :(
[03:29:45] <code_ph0y> yyyaaaaaaaas!
[03:29:45] <code_ph0y> :D
[03:29:50] <xdjuj__> :)
[03:30:03] <xdjuj__> You should have try it before :p It was simple to copy/paste :p
[03:30:16] <code_ph0y> yeah bud lol
[03:31:08] <code_ph0y> thought I would ask the experts I think that code should work btw I had an error before hand and I didn't refresh so it wasn't allowing the js to be loaded
[03:31:12] <xdjuj__> veleiro you've missed a #
[03:31:20] <code_ph0y> but atleast it works :D
[03:31:38] <xdjuj__> veleiro something like
[03:31:43] <xdjuj__> document.getElementById("#slide"+newcounter).getElementsByTagName("span").getAttribute("title");
[03:31:45] <code_ph0y> veleiro: :S
[03:31:54] <code_ph0y> are you using jquery?
[03:31:56] <xdjuj__> Hum in jQuery maybe veleiro ? :)
[03:32:26] <veleiro> I dont know how to start using jquery in my script, although i have jquery libraries loaded
[03:32:31] <xdjuj__> jQuery("#slide1").chlidren("span").attr("title");
[03:34:09] <veleiro> xdjuj__  that seemed to work, although alert returned "undefined" and not 1?
[03:34:09] <code_ph0y> gonna have to get back to this hope you get it sorted veleiro ... and thanks xdjuj__!
[03:34:18] <xdjuj__> code_ph0y maybe you should add an : event.preventDefault(); in your click function, to prevent the normal action ?
[03:34:24] <veleiro> thank you
[03:34:36] <xdjuj__> veleiro so that's not working :p
[03:34:48] <veleiro> darn
[03:35:16] <xdjuj__> veleiro try this
[03:35:18] <veleiro> i forgot to mention
[03:35:25] <veleiro> it should only get the FIRST span child
[03:35:32] <code_ph0y> veleiro: you might wanna sort your html
[03:35:38] <veleiro> so it probably grabbed many
[03:35:39] <xdjuj__> jQuery("#slide1").children("p span").attr("title");
[03:35:39] <code_ph0y> it looks like there is a p tag
[03:35:43] <xdjuj__> Or maybe find
[03:35:48] <xdjuj__> jQuery("#slide1").find("span").attr("title");
[03:36:32] <veleiro> BEAUTIFUL
[03:36:37] <veleiro> got it, thanks xdjuj__
[03:36:53] <xdjuj__> veleiro => The .children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a single level down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels to select descendant elements (grandchildren, etc.) as well.

[03:37:36] <hirsty> Hi all im having issues with my jquery datepicker, i cannot really give code as it is a commercial product :D but i ccan say the issue i am having is the datepciker will not view with the input box, the element in question is  such as this in css div > table > tbody > tr > td > div > form > input
[03:37:43] <veleiro> perfect, thanks
[03:37:59] <veleiro> makes sense
[03:38:30] <hirsty> using jQuery 1.6
[03:41:40] <adifah> hi everybody, i have a question regarding animations: when closing a dialog it should transfer and minimize to a specific element (already realized using the beforeClose event, with a duration of 1sec), but now there is the requirement that also the opacity has to change. The clue is, that the opacity shouldn't start changing at the same time but after 0.5s
[03:47:44] <ravenzz> ?delay @ adifah
[03:47:45] <bot-t> adifah, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[03:49:49] <LordThumper> Does anyone know how to define a static jQuery plugin?
[03:50:02] <LordThumper> That would be called like so: $.plugin()
[03:50:38] <LordThumper> instead of $.fn.plugin = function () { }
[03:51:38] <xec> LordThumper: couldn't you just do $.plugin = function() {}
[03:52:39] <LordThumper> Ah that' right, thanks
[03:53:11] <LordThumper> that's*
[03:54:51] <adifah> ravenzz: big thx for the hint, i will have a look
[03:55:15] <sunbeam> I need a good calendar, that where I can black out (select) multiple dates with
[03:55:18] <sunbeam> Any advices
[03:56:53] <Clex> sunbeam: the classic one is the Jquery UI datepicker.
[03:57:16] <sunbeam> and i want to give each second (even) date another style
[03:57:19] <sunbeam> is that also possible?
[03:57:33] <sunbeam> Yes the datepicker inline used might be an option
[03:57:34] <adifah> ravenzz: but delay only effects items in queue, so i have to create two animations with disabled queue? because otherwise they will be performed one after the other with a delay between?
[04:00:22] <sjeijk> hi guys how do make an if statement where i want to check if a div is empty?

[04:07:20] <xec> sjeijk: you could do .is(":empty") as well
[04:08:13] <Deviad> I don't know after the submit button has been pressed how I can execute some other code to change the color of the wrong compiled fields back to their initial status.
[04:09:29] <sjeijk> thanks dec, that actually works better for me since somehow the method above gave back wrong result :)
[04:09:34] <sjeijk> xec*
[04:09:35] <Clex> Deviad: if ($('#email').val() == '') { $('#email').css('backgroundColor', '#FF0000'); } else { $('#email').css('backgroundColor', '...'); } etc.

[04:14:40] <bot-t> Hatem2012, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:14:59] <Hatem2012> ok
[04:16:30] <Hatem2012> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12053521/how-to-iterate-with-fade-out
[04:16:30] <Hatem2012> the question is there
[04:17:48] <veleiro> how can I check if an element exists, and if it doesnt-- open a link?    if (("#slide"+number) == null) window.location= "next.html";  ?
[04:18:07] <Hatem2012> it exists
[04:18:12] <Hatem2012> i check them
[04:18:41] <xec> veleiro: you can check the .length of the collection
[04:18:48] <Hatem2012> ok
[04:19:13] <Hatem2012> 2
[04:19:16] <xec> veleiro: like if ($("#slide12").length) { ... }
[04:19:29] <xec> Hatem2012: are you new to IRC?
[04:19:35] <Hatem2012> yep
[04:20:10] <xec> Hatem2012: ok. this is a room with 850 clients connected at the moment - not every message is for you ;)
[04:20:48] <Hatem2012> ok, sorry
[04:21:15] <xec> Hatem2012: also, if you posted your question to stackoverflow, you are likely to get a decent answer there, just give it some time. if you don't you can try to improve the wording of your question, it looks a bit vague to me, i'm not quite sure what you're after
[04:21:35] <veleiro> beautiful! thanks xec
[04:22:48] <xec> veleiro: of course, what you wanted was the opposite -- you can just negate it with ! or check if it is 0
[04:23:57] <veleiro> yep, i used else
[04:27:02] <Deviad> Clex: I tried your suggestion but it does not work, because once the user has made a mistake and pressed submit the program returns false and does not pass the values to the .php file.
[04:27:36] <Clex> Deviad: you are supposed to return false only if there's an error.
[04:27:57] <Christer_> Hi all, Does anyone of you know why using $.slideUp() on a tablerow just makes it hide almost instantly instead of actually sliding it up ?
[04:28:41] <Deviad> Clex: but if I don't use return false in there then the browser goes to the .php file
[04:29:39] <Clex> Deviad: well that's the point if everything is correct, no?
[04:31:33] <Deviad> Clex: what I want to do is after the user has made a mistake and the box has been colored with red, then when he focuses on that 'text' the color has to change back to what it was.
[04:32:14] <Deviad> and this happens after the dialog box has been popped up and the wrong fields marked.
[04:33:35] <AlexC_> G'morning
[04:33:46] <AlexC_> Have templates been implemented into the core, or did it never go in?
[04:34:03] <Clex> Deviad: then check the "change" callbackl.
[04:34:18] <Deviad> so probably I need a while(true) {$('#subscribeform').submit(function() {...}); if {} else {}}
[04:34:20] <Christer_> Could anyone have a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/Christer/JTRKY/ - Why doesnt it slide?
[04:35:15] <Clex> Deviad: a "while (true)"? I really don't think so.
[04:35:25] <Deviad> otherwise nothing after the return false is executed and just the $('#subscribeform').submit(function() {...}); keeps working.
[04:35:29] <Clex> Use $('#subscribeform').change()
[04:35:44] <Clex> To get a callback called when a change is made.
[04:37:05] <wltoriginal> Hi all.
[04:37:26] <ekpyrotic> Guys, I can't seem to add a class to the containing ul (see last .appendTo( ul )): http://pastebin.com/j0NK5GbX
[04:38:12] <wltoriginal> Is asking the server for data insecure? Can json that is returned from the server and inserted into my webpage by my javascript be 'dangerous'?
[04:39:50] <Christer_> ekpyrotic: try using quotes around.
[04:40:12] <Christer_> oh wait
[04:40:13] <Christer_> sorry
[04:40:17] <Christer_> didnt see that functio var.
[04:44:46] <iivvoo> hi
[04:45:37] <iivvoo> I'm using jquery 1.4.1 and using .load() to load a fragment. The url I use is relative, e.g. on https://foo.org/group/1/ I load("description") to effectively load https://foo.org/group/1/description
[04:45:55] <iivvoo> but I have the impression it's loading from http: not https. on chrome
[04:46:03] <iivvoo> has anyone seen this before?
[04:47:50] <sjeijk> hi all i'm working on http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/wizard.html and I'm confused why the wizard works the first time, but not the second time… I'm guessing that the edit button which starts the wizard unbinds its function when I update the column with results. Can some1 confirm this?
[04:51:27] <ekpyrotic> Any ideas how I can add a class to the bottom ul: http://pastebin.com/j0NK5GbX
[04:52:27] <Solow> Is there a prettier way to do this: var body = $('body'); body.css('padding-top', (parseInt(body.css('padding-top')) + 20) + 'px');
[04:56:33] <xec> Solow: you can add to the padding with "+=20"
[04:56:48] <Solow> xec: I tried that, but that didn't work.
[04:58:03] <xec> Solow: http://jsfiddle.net/HxXcr/
[04:58:15] <Solow> odd.
[04:58:17] <xec> Solow: when inspecting i see 40px padding-top on <body>
[04:59:15] <xec> Solow: i think it was added in a semi-recent version though, are you running an old jquery version?
[04:59:38] <Solow> xec: No, I did +=20px in stead of 20.
[04:59:43] <Solow> Works now.
[04:59:43] <xec> aha :)
[04:59:54] <Solow> silly me
[05:01:27] <Solow> Is it just me or are users weird people? I had a "loading indicator" on my page which hid everything until I was done loading everything. Problem was that this added about 120ms of rendering time because it depended on some dynamic data, so I removed it. Though they really want the loading indicator because it's "pretty".
[05:02:00] <Solow> (so terminology wise, "rendering time" is wrong. I should have said loading time)
[05:14:18] <kai> hey folks
[05:15:06] <guy> Is there any magic to convert array of arrays to array of objects? given that array (that needs to be converted to an object) always have the same value sequencen that references to date and quantity? eg. [[new Date(), 10], [new Date(), 10]] needs to become [{date: new Date(), quantity: 10}]
[05:15:29] <faraway> Solow: users are "weird"
[05:15:36] <kai> guy: you can use map, I guess
[05:16:28] <kai> I'm trying to keep a jqueryui.sortable within a jqueryui.sortable, and it seems like drop events are propagated to the outer sortable as well
[05:16:30] <guy> Poor cross browser support. Well. Will need to iterate the whole data set then.
[05:17:03] <blackspotwiggins> guy, how would you do it without iterating?
[05:17:30] <guy> blackspotwiggins: I meant using for() rahter than some dedicated internal JS function
[05:17:41] <blackspotwiggins> map?
[05:17:47] <kai> guy: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/ ?
[05:17:56] <blackspotwiggins> it still iterates, even if internally
[05:18:00] <kai> blackspotwiggins: that's what I suggested
[05:18:24] <faraway> Solow: on the other hand programmers are weird cause when they use pc's they do (for the normal users point of view) to magical things ;)
[05:20:07] <Solow> faraway: I guess you're right. The real challenge is making something "dumb" enough to call it user friendly. :p
[05:20:49] <kai> anyway, is there something like "greedy" for sortables?
[05:22:39] <faraway> Solow: not dump enough but fit the way the users acts … it doesn't need to fit his expectation, but it should make the user feel comfortable.
[05:23:23] <Solow> faraway: Understandable. How do you do that? just perform user tests right?
[05:25:23] <faraway> Solow: in many situations there is no way around tests. but you need to take care that you don't do to much tests with the same user otherwise he knows what is happening and so he is "burned"
[05:27:59] <faraway> Solow: other things like the 3 seconds rule, that you can know without user studies :D
[05:28:26] <Solow> faraway: 3 second rules?
[05:30:36] <faraway> Solow: if a page takes longer then 3 seconds to load and there is no real reason why the user wants to visit the page it is likely that he will close the browser window again
[05:31:07] <blackspotwiggins> faraway, must suck for most of mobile browser users
[05:32:44] <Solow> faraway: I actually try to stay under 500ms (rendering included). To my knowledge the real limit is 1 second, after which a user loses interest (loses their flow of thought)
[05:32:48] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: that's a real problem
[05:33:15] <blackspotwiggins> until LTE, it's not going to improve much
[05:33:47] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: for websites users learned that they could load slow
[05:34:08] <Solow> faraway: But because I work with requireJS, I can usually give the user a very fast response. A message will tell them that the content is being setup, and while they're reading I'm already done.
[05:35:13] <blackspotwiggins> mobile performance is hard
[05:35:30] <blackspotwiggins> either too many requests or preloading too much stuff
[05:36:09] <faraway> blackspotwiggins, Solow: well i should be a little bit more clear about the 3 secs
[05:36:25] <faraway> you have about 3 secs to catch the user, then he is willed to wait a little bit longer
[05:36:47] <Solow> or she, you sexist.
[05:36:50] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[05:36:55] <blackspotwiggins> you should give some feedback asap
[05:37:02] <Solow> You think girls don't know how the internet works?
[05:37:08] <Solow> :p
[05:37:26] <faraway> :P
[05:37:36] <Solow> faraway: I understand. I just googled it.
[05:37:39] <faraway> users don't know how internet works
[05:37:55] <Solow> faraway: You basically mean "http://www.future-ink.com/blog/1-web-design-mistake-ignoring-the-%E2%80%9C3-second-rule%E2%80%9D/" this right
[05:39:22] <faraway> Solow: basicly yes .. there are some other effects
[05:40:15] <Solow> faraway, Such as?
[05:40:33] <faraway> Solow: if the page is loading and the user has no feedback that something is going on it could happen that he does a reload, waits, does a reload again, and so on :D there are really strange behaviors
[05:40:42] <faraway> Solow: yes
[05:42:13] <faraway> Solow: to tell the correct background and to say it exactly  i need to look it up again what i learned in usability engineering.
[05:42:32] <Solow> faraway: Oh but that's fairly logical if you ask me.
[05:42:39] <Solow> You don't need a training to know that :p
[05:43:16] <faraway> Solow: hehe .. ;)  well there where informations about what to display to catch the user and how to do it
[05:43:31] <faraway> Solow: who many links the user will follow
[05:44:31] <fdv> any datatables gurus around? is there a way to specify "complex headers" (i.e., multiple rows of grouped headers) with aoColumns so that you don't have to create the table in the DOM first?
[05:44:41] <faraway> Solow: hotpoints/area and how user reads ….
[05:44:57] <Solow> faraway: Like the "F" research
[05:45:11] <Solow> faraway: And the "outstanding figures in a flat landscape"
[05:45:31] <Solow> I know them :p
[05:45:38] <faraway> Solow: something like that
[05:46:07] <faraway> Solow: or the more "highlights" are the less importent they get.
[05:46:14] <Solow> Obviously
[05:46:25] <faraway> Solow: like customers "make this bold, and this red, and this should have an arrow"
[05:46:42] <Solow> It's like a shitload of traffic signs. They all require your attention but you end up driving off of a cliff because you're to busy reading the signs.
[05:47:17] <faraway> Solow: or you have 10 and you don't know which is the important one
[05:48:02] <faraway> Solow: it's nothing special but often you forget it or you don't realize that you did that mistake
[05:48:33] <faraway> Solow: or you are so used to you page that you won't realize it even if you would search for it
[05:48:48] <Solow> faraway: That's why I ask random people to test my products. It's usually mouth to mouth advertising where I give them a couple euro's for their attention.
[05:49:11] <Solow> true. Getting used to something is dangerous when working on usability
[05:50:11] <faraway> Solow: definitely
[05:50:42] <faraway> Solow: the good thing on usability is you talk with many people you have never known before :D
[05:51:08] <mikehaas763> Good Morning. Can someone take a look at the following fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/M98MX/
[05:51:18] <Solow> gross dude
[05:51:30] <mikehaas763> It is really short but I have a problem where when I click a row my modal dialog overlay does not show until there is a 2nd click
[05:51:42] <mikehaas763> I am using jquery tools
[05:51:59] <Solow> mikehaas763: http://jsfiddle.net/M98MX/1/
[05:52:17] <Solow> You forgot a });
[05:52:24] <ak> is there something in jquery like defer in underscore.js? (_.defer() )
[05:52:50] <Solow> ak: Like jquery deferred?
[05:53:06] <guy> How far would I be from telling a truth if I told my client that "Flash is (ActionScript) is dead."
[05:53:10] <guy> -is
[05:53:31] <Solow> guy: really really far.
[05:53:36] <ak> Solow: is it working the same way? :O
[05:53:37] <blackspotwiggins> it's not really dead
[05:53:38] <guy> I am being asked to justify my decision to use JS over AS for the project.
[05:53:42] <blackspotwiggins> until zombo.com goes out
[05:53:42] <Solow> guy: But you can give him / her the disadvantages
[05:53:47] <ak> deferred is for ajax calls only ot nort?
[05:53:49] <Solow> ak: not sure. Take a look: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[05:54:00] <Solow> ak: nope
[05:54:08] <blackspotwiggins> guy, browsers run that natively, thats a good enough reason IMO
[05:54:08] <faraway> guy: well … http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/
[05:54:20] <Trisox> any one knows best way to load in jquery mobile with modernizr / yep nope for
[05:54:38] <Solow> guy: Then tell them about mobile compatibility, vulnerabilities, performance, relying on a flash installation etc
[05:55:03] <blackspotwiggins> the best argument is going to be - its not gonna work on ipads
[05:55:08] <faraway> guy: so if adobe works on a tool for a flash replacement, then they also know it is dead ;)
[05:55:10] <kai> oh well, I give up. I guess people will have to delete one instance when dropping stuff into a nested sortable
[05:55:11] <blackspotwiggins> PHBs go nuts about that :P
[05:55:52] <mikehaas763> Solow, sorry I did actually have the }); I just forgot to include it in the fiddle
[05:57:47] <Solow> mikehaas763: Oh. ok :) Then I don't know. Have you tried adding the ready around it? to make sure the lookups work
[06:02:51] <Solow> If I pass a function "this", is it by reference?
[06:02:54] <mikehaas763> Yep I tried wrapping it in the ready method. No luck I found a problem someone else had with fancybox requiring two clicks at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6510194/why-does-fancybox-require-two-clicks-activate so I'm trying to decipher that
[06:07:35] <Solow> nm. answer is yes.
[06:13:11] <ak> i got here a form element, if it's container is hidden, and i try to trigger the click event on it, i get some error, if it's container is visible, and trigger the click event on it, it works...
[06:13:32] <brettfrable> best way to do that
[06:13:33] <ak> does this make any sense?
[06:13:37] <brettfrable> is ad a click event
[06:13:41] <brettfrable> and make a class
[06:13:51] <brettfrable> .visible - and .invisible
[06:13:57] <brettfrable> do display: block for visible
[06:14:05] <brettfrable> and display: hidden for invisible
[06:14:09] <ak> brettfrable: no i want something diferent here..
[06:14:14] <ak> ;)
[06:14:16] <brettfrable> on the click event - add class Visible
[06:15:14] <ak> i want to trigger (like $('#mycheckbox').trigger('click');) while it's container element is hidden...
[06:15:59] <ak> and the function that get's triggered just gives some error...
[06:16:11] <ak> but if the container is visible, it works
[06:19:27] <kai> oh, great
[06:19:56] <kai> fixed my problem by using min-height rather than padding to get a decent height for my drop area
[06:20:13] <faraway> ak: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/Z3MNL/3/  ?
[06:21:44] <kai> hm, in chrome, at least...
[06:21:56] <ak> faraway: i'm working on a jsfiddle now, 2 min...
[06:28:20] <WebGate> Hi ! i have i little question about syntax
[06:28:28] <WebGate> How to say, with the good syntax
[06:28:42] <WebGate> if $('#MyImage').height('Xpx'){ $('MyDiv').height = ('Xpx')};
[06:29:18] <NodeX> height() accepts an integer
[06:29:43] <WebGate> Can you be clever ?
[06:29:51] <NodeX> ???
[06:29:57] <pachet> NodeX can be very clever
[06:30:18] <NodeX> if($("#MyImage").height()>=SomeNumber) { $("MyDiv").height(200); }
[06:30:23] <NodeX> like that ?
[06:30:23] <pachet> maybe he meant 'clearer'
[06:30:27] <NodeX> oh lol
[06:30:29] <WebGate> yes ...s orry
[06:30:30] <NodeX> lmfai
[06:30:32] <NodeX> o
[06:30:33] <WebGate> misstype
[06:31:01] <pachet> WebGate: yeah, just pass in an integer to .height(), as NodeX said
[06:31:06] <WebGate> if($("#MyImage").height()>=SomeNumber) { $("MyDiv").height(SomeNumber); }
[06:31:15] <pachet> if you need to be more anatomical about how you're specifying those values, use .css
[06:31:24] <pachet> eg .css({ height : '40em' })
[06:32:09] <NodeX> ^^
[06:33:27] * hlveheart cheers.
[06:33:29] <hlveheart> BOOTSTRAP UPDATE YAY
[06:39:26] <sadtaco> Huh.  Didn't think this would work for some reason ".class:not(:empty):last" get the last of that class which isn't empty. jQuery sure is helpful.
[06:47:06] <subdesign> how to grab textarea content if i add it dynamically and fill it from db. logging the textarea i get only the text from db, not the modified one

[06:51:37] <niix> any one know why js object (FullCalendar.js) is posting times +4 hours, (i.e. Event says 8 am to 12 pm, but posts as 12 to 16)
[06:51:56] <faraway> developer1987: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/r7Zaf/
[06:52:50] <developer1987> thanks faraway: that really worked for me ;)
[06:56:18] <subdesign> what is the "live"s parameter that triggers a fade in, when php puts an error message div on site?
[06:56:52] <subdesign> event not parameter
[06:56:57] <faraway_> niix: my guess would be timezone.
[06:57:41] <niix> faraway_: yeah it's strange because it was posting fine before but all of a sudden I have the offset time - any idea how to change it? My computer is setup fine
[06:58:09] <faraway_> niix: you get the event times form you server ?
[06:58:48] <niix> faraway_: it's a local server
[06:59:06] <faraway_> faraway_: you should check it there something changed
[06:59:22] <faraway_> niix: ^^  damn i need to go now :D
[06:59:40] <niix> http://oi46.tinypic.com/jfzot1.jpg , posts as "startHour":"2012-08-22T13:00:00.000Z","endHour":"2012-08-22T16:00:00.000Z"
[07:00:37] <faraway_> niix: good look in finding the problem. i would guess the date you get from you server changed somehow if it worked before, differnt formating or something like that
[07:00:45] <dangerousdave> how do i access html 5 data attributes using jquery?

[07:03:31] <subdesign> ok whats the best event for checking if there a specific class appears in the dom?
[07:04:06] <freazy> hi, can someone help me by my css problem? i try to implement the footer-stick-alt but it shows up a scrollbar.

[07:04:07] <freazy> http://jsfiddle.net/Zr82J/
[07:04:37] <subdesign> quicksilver, and if I dynamically add this div with jquery?
[07:05:03] <quicksilver> subdesign: I don't understand what you are asking.
[07:05:04] <subdesign> no page refresh
[07:05:07] <xdjuj> I've exactly the same question than subdesign
[07:05:22] <quicksilver> subdesign: that code I just pasted will always work to gheck if a class appears
[07:05:27] <quicksilver> but I don't know what you mean by 'event'
[07:05:43] <xdjuj> No that's not the same question so :)
[07:05:43] <subdesign> event for live or on
[07:05:45] <quicksilver> do you mean, you want certain code to run immediately that a particular class appears
[07:06:01] <subdesign> quicksilver, yes
[07:06:06] <quicksilver> the answer is you can't.
[07:06:12] <xdjuj> quicksilver I think I have a concrete exemple
[07:06:16] <xdjuj> Damned
[07:06:22] <quicksilver> there are no (reliable, cross-browse) events fired when DOM elements are added or changed.
[07:06:22] <xdjuj> Can we reload the DOM ?
[07:06:30] <quicksilver> you don't need to reload the DOM
[07:06:30] <subdesign> hm
[07:06:32] <quicksilver> why would you?
[07:06:48] <quicksilver> whenever you run the code if ($('.classname').length > 0)  it will return the correct answer
[07:06:49] <xdjuj> quicksilver I have an event on .delete
[07:06:51] <quicksilver> nothing needs to be 'reloaded'
[07:06:57] <subdesign> checking..
[07:07:01] <quicksilver> but there is no event automatically notifying you
[07:07:06] <xdjuj> It works fine for those already in the source code
[07:07:14] <quicksilver> what works fine?
[07:07:21] <quicksilver> you can show me what you're actually trying to do?
[07:07:27] <xdjuj> If I had another .delete with jQuery in Ajax
[07:07:43] <MrDup> Hi
[07:07:44] <xdjuj> That one is not trigger
[07:07:59] <MrDup> May I ask you a question about the validationEngine plugin ?
[07:08:22] <quicksilver> "If I had another .delete with jQuery in Ajax" <- I'm afraid I do not understand what you are asking.
[07:08:31] <quicksilver> "That one is not trigger" <- what is not triggered?
[07:08:44] <quicksilver> What do you see? What do you expect to see? What do you want to happen? What happens instead?
[07:09:00] <quicksilver> perhaps you can write a small example in jsfiddle
[07:09:08] <quicksilver> I'm pretty sure there is an easy answer and you are asking the wrong questions.
[07:09:28] <MrDup> quicksilver: you're talking about my question ?
[07:10:09] <xdjuj> quicksilver I have this
[07:10:10] <xdjuj> http://jquery.pastebin.fr/23884
[07:10:22] <xdjuj> 1) Loading function "supprimer" (delete)
[07:10:34] <xdjuj> Working fine on all .supprimer in the source code
[07:11:23] <xdjuj> Then, I have droppable, at drop, I use JSON to get some content, and generate another .supprimer (in order to be able to delete this new content if I want)
[07:11:24] <quicksilver> xdjuj: and then it doesn't work on .supprimers added later?
[07:11:37] <xdjuj> And that, is not working, this one is not working
[07:11:40] <xdjuj> Yes
[07:11:48] <quicksilver> that's because you are using on wrongly.
[07:11:53] <xdjuj> This new ".supprimer" is not triggered by jQuery
[07:11:59] <xdjuj> Ha ok ! :)
[07:12:16] <MrDup> xdjuj: tu peux lire mes messages ?
[07:12:26] <dangerousdave> This line is not working for me, can i use "this" in this way? var dialog = $(this).data("data-dialog");
[07:12:30] <xdjuj> MrDup bah oui :)
[07:12:41] <xdjuj> Mais je vois pas de messages privés :)
[07:12:42] <quicksilver> MrDup: yes, I know nothing about the validation plugin but if you don't post your question no one will answer it.
[07:12:43] <MrDup> xdjuj: nan mais c'est pas evident, j'ai l'impression de parler dans le vide.
[07:13:02] <MrDup> quicksilver: I asked if I can. ;)
[07:13:03] <MrDup> So
[07:13:32] <xdjuj> So what about validationEngine plugin MrDup :)
[07:13:35] <quicksilver> xdjuj: you should read teh whole documentation to "on" to http://api.jquery.com/on/ but the short answer is you need to $(document).on("click",".supprimer", function() ... )
[07:13:44] * hlveheart slaps quicksilver around a bit with a large trout
[07:13:47] * hlveheart hides
[07:13:47] <quicksilver> especially the section on the documentation on delegation.
[07:14:04] <MrDup> I use validation engine in 3 forms in my document. But for an unknown reason, it doesn't work on the last one.
[07:14:20] <xdjuj> Hum quicksilver
[07:14:21] <xdjuj> $(document).on("click",".supprimer", function() ... )
[07:14:29] <xdjuj> That's exactly what I have done no ?
[07:14:35] <quicksilver> xdjuj: oh.
[07:14:35] <xdjuj> jQuery(document).on('click','.supprimer', function(e) {
[07:14:40] <MrDup> It seems to be the 'attach' call that doesnt work, but I don't know why
[07:14:44] <quicksilver> xdjuj: sorry I didn't actually look at your code now.
[07:14:56] <quicksilver> xdjuj: until just now, I mean :) I just guessed from what you are saying.
[07:15:06] <MrDup> It doesn't fire any event of Sucess or Failure.
[07:15:07] <xdjuj> héhé ok :)
[07:15:19] <xdjuj> Only on the last event MrDup ?
[07:15:22] <quicksilver> xdjuj: but I would point out that 'supprimer()' won't be called at all if there aren't any .supprimers in the document at load time.
[07:15:30] <quicksilver> if(jQuery('.supprimer').length){ initSupprimer = supprimer(); }
[07:15:45] <quicksilver> you should surely *always* call supprimer() in case some are added later.
[07:15:49] <xdjuj> Hum great idea ! I'll have a look :)
[07:15:53] <MrDup> xdjuj: I do the attachement on document.ready.
[07:16:02] <Solow> I'm using requireJS and jquery. I'm trying to create some markup (I'm afraid it has to be done dynamically). I don't want to have the markup in my js (for obvious reasons) but I also don't want to use jquery template. What alternatives do I have left? Load in the markup dynamically?
[07:16:35] <MrDup> I try to place an alert before calling attach and in onSuccess and onFailure callbacks.
[07:16:41] <MrDup> But nothing happens.
[07:16:44] <xdjuj> Damned ! quicksilver thanx a lot !! :) You're right !! :)
[07:16:46] <xdjuj> Great !
[07:16:56] * dangerousdave This line is not working for me, can i use "this" in this way?var dialog = $(this).data("data-dialog");
[07:17:05] <pachet> Solow: just pull in html via ajax?
[07:17:39] <Solow> pachet: So, load it in dynamically. Should I use the "requireJs text!" plugin? it looks promising.
[07:17:43] <j28> @Solow a lot of people like http://handlebarsjs.com/ there are quite a few templating engines out there.
[07:18:16] <pachet> Solow: yeah, it's not bad
[07:18:18] <Solow> j28: I don't like templating engines.
[07:18:24] <pachet> if you're already leveraging require it's probably not a bad idea
[07:18:33] <freazy> hi, i have a little css problem. can someone help me to clear the footer from the content? http://jsfiddle.net/Zr82J/3/ pls help
[07:18:47] <MrDup> http://jquery.pastebin.fr/23885 <= this doesn't display anything but "PAF" in alert box.
[07:19:41] <mikehaas763> Hi. I am using jquery tools overlay. I discovered that I had the "in page" script for the overlay right before the "content" div and the same script right before the </body> tag. It all worked fine. However once I removed the first script that was right before the content div it required me to click twice before the overlay would show. Any ideas why this is happening?
[07:19:53] <MrDup> I checked my scripts to be linked, and my 2 other forms are running well.
[07:20:23] <xdjuj> MrDup why didn't you use a CLASS to trigger those actions ?
[07:20:41] <xdjuj> $("form.maClasseQuiDeclenche").validationEngine('attach'
[07:20:56] <xdjuj> In order to have the same action for all ?
[07:21:13] <xdjuj> Then what are telling Firebug console ? Is there an error triggered ?
[07:21:16] <MrDup> because my forms are identified by Id. ^^
[07:21:33] <quicksilver> dangerousdave: that's valid syntax. But whether it does what you want depends what 'this' is.
[07:21:45] <xdjuj> Yes :) But if you use a class, you're able to have a generique function and re-use it at any time :)
[07:21:48] <quicksilver> dangerousdave: do you really mean .data("data-dialog") and not just .data("dialog") ?
[07:21:50] <MrDup> And as I sayd below, it works with two other forms in the same document
[07:22:04] <quicksilver> MrDup: without seeing the whole thing it's very hard to tell.
[07:22:08] <quicksilver> MrDup: maybe you used that ID more than once
[07:22:22] <xdjuj> Sure, but with one only class/function you're SURE that there's no mistakes anywhere else :)
[07:22:46] <MrDup> quicksilver: I don't see other element with this one in my rendered document.
[07:23:08] <MrDup> xdjuj: I'm gonna try it
[07:23:28] <xdjuj> And you JS will be more compact with only one function ;-)
[07:23:30] <dangerousdave> quicksilver: i think my code is bollocks actually, I have a link with the attribute data-dialog="login_dialog", and I want to use this attribute to access an element on the page with "login_dialog" value as an id
[07:23:42] <zatan> hey how can I set some sleep time on this function(data) {          $(get_dom).html(data); }) I want to wait until html effect is finished
[07:24:30] <Cork> zatan: what do you mean by  "html effect"?
[07:24:36] <xdjuj> dangerousdave something like : target = jQuery(this).data(dialog); jQuery(target).whateverYouWant();
[07:24:41] <MrDup> Just a last question before I try this : is the event document.ready fired everytime the document is modified ? Including a modification of only a div in my document ?
[07:24:43] <quicksilver> dangerousdave: that would be just .data("dialog") yes.
[07:24:49] <xdjuj> Sorry dangerousdave maybe
[07:24:58] <Cork> MrDup: no
[07:25:00] <xdjuj> dangerousdave something like : target = jQuery(this).data(dialog); jQuery("#"+target).whateverYouWant();
[07:25:23] <dangerousdave> quicksilver: ah yes, i do mean "dialog" and not "data-dialog"
[07:25:29] <Cork> MrDup: its called on DOMContentLoaded or .load if the other doesn't exist
[07:25:31] <xdjuj> MrDup no but you can use .on or live or thinks like that
[07:25:40] <dangerousdave> xdjuj: trying now, thanks!
[07:26:08] <xdjuj> MrDup exactly like in my example (pastebin)
[07:28:32] <zatan> Cork,  after callign $.get and gettings sucess results I am doing $(dom).html(data) its takes some time to rendering, and I want to show ajax spinner
[07:29:22] <Cork> zatan: setTimeout(function() { $(spinner).hide(); }, 1000);
[07:30:22] <xdjuj> Or maybe it's better to add the spinner before, and then delete it with the return success ? :)
[07:30:33] <xdjuj> In order to have the wright time of display
[07:30:42] <xdjuj> -time +duration
[07:30:54] <MrDup> Ok, just a precision : my third form (the one that doesn't work) is in a html file loaded via the load method.
[07:31:03] <Cork> xdjuj: the add should be before the ajax call yes
[07:31:06] <mikehaas763> Can someone look at this fiddle and tell me why it is taking two clicks on a <tr> to display the jquery tools overlay?
[07:31:07] <Cork> but the hide needs to be in a timer if the rendering is what takes time
[07:31:12] <mikehaas763> http://jsfiddle.net/XLGYZ/1/
[07:31:20] <MrDup> So the ready event is not fired when it's loaded.
[07:31:51] <xdjuj> MrDup so you must use ".on" or ".live" or ".bind"
[07:32:03] <xdjuj> That's exactly my pastebin MrDup ;-)
[07:32:04] <jedimind> anyone know of any quick methods to get position().right ?
[07:32:07] <jedimind> instead of just top / left
[07:32:15] <xdjuj> Tiens pour toi => http://chez-syl.fr/2012/02/les-evenements-sur-des-elements-charges-en-ajax/
[07:32:16] <Cork> xdjuj: ready has nothing to do with content modification
[07:32:24] <xdjuj> MrDup => http://chez-syl.fr/2011/12/comment-traduire-gestionnaires-evenements-avec-le-nouveau-on/
[07:33:07] <zatan> Cork,  cheers works like charm :)
[07:33:21] <Cork> jedimind: position().left + $(this).outerWidth(true)
[07:33:43] <quicksilver> MrDup, xdjuj : as I said before, there is no reliable crossbrowser event fired when the dom is modified, elements are added, or anything like that.
[07:33:49] <jedimind> that gives me ... left offset + width... not the right offset
[07:33:52] <quicksilver> which is why .on() uses a different approach.
[07:33:57] <Cork> hmm might actually be outerWidth() else it would take the margin into consideratio
[07:34:01] <jedimind> i suppose i could then subtract that from the width of the container
[07:34:05] <jedimind> that seems silly
[07:34:11] <Cork> jedimind: there is no right offset
[07:34:25] <Cork> offset is to the left side of the element
[07:36:53] <MrDup> http://jquery.pastebin.fr/23886 <= Here is my html source : When this one is loaded (load method), I can see an alert saying "PAF", but it seems to stop here, the 'attach' method next to "alert("PAF");" does not display any of success or failure alert.
[07:37:13] <MrDup> Anything in the console log.
[07:37:35] <Trisox> what is the best swipe detection lib out there that works with cloned elements so paged binded? now using jquery mobile.. for test this works but adds a lot of extra elements to the page i dont need or want
[07:37:46] <Trisox> i need to detect left and right swiping
[07:37:48] <MrDup> No error about a method not found or a undefined object.
[07:37:53] <ML74> Could someone help me with a problem I'm having with the cloud-zoom plugin: http://www.cookstop.co.uk/products/fish-tweezers/. It just doesn't seem to be working at all.
[07:39:09] <tocka> is it possible to make a HTTP DELETE request with jQuery?
[07:39:28] <styxlt> da what?
[07:39:43] <MrDup> What do you mean by "HTTP DELETE request" ?
[07:39:49] <tocka> nvm found it
[07:40:00] <tocka> I mean this
[07:40:00] <tocka> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2153917/how-to-send-a-put-delete-request-in-jquery
[07:40:01] <styxlt> would you mind sharing it?
[07:41:12] <quicksilver> MrDup: DELETE is a possible HTTP verb, like GET and POST.
[07:41:22] <MrDup> quicksilver: ok. =)
[07:41:35] <tocka> don't forget PUT!
[07:41:35] <quicksilver> http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html
[07:41:48] <MrDup> quicksilver: did you see something I missed in my code ?
[07:41:52] <quicksilver> MrDup: no.
[07:41:58] <quicksilver> MrDup: that tiny fragment is useless to me.
[07:42:16] <quicksilver> if you want someone to help you find out what is broken you need either (1) demonstrate a short broken example on jsfiddle
[07:42:19] <MrDup> The second is not enough too ?
[07:42:25] <quicksilver> or (2) give access to uyour real page.
[07:42:34] <quicksilver> MrDup: yes, the second one is useless to me.
[07:42:36] <xdjuj> MrDup maybe the "trick" would be to exceture validationEngine in a <script> balise just after you add it to the DOM :)
[07:42:43] <quicksilver> A tiny fragment of html and javascript
[07:42:51] <quicksilver> which I cannot run or experiment with
[07:43:35] <MrDup> quicksilver: it uses CodeIgniter, Smarty and a mysql DB,...
[07:43:43] <MrDup> I can't give you anything more. :/
[07:43:47] <Cork> mikehaas763: from what i can tell its something in .overlay that fails
[07:43:58] <Cork> mikehaas763: everything up to that point works
[07:44:02] <MrDup> xdjuj: let's try it again. ^^
[07:44:55] <Cork> mikehaas763: ah, what does .load() do there?
[07:45:22] <mikehaas763> Cork, thanks for looking ya that's what I determined. .load() according to http://jquerytools.org/documentation/overlay/ "Opens the overlay"
[07:46:49] <Cork> mikehaas763: http://jsfiddle.net/XLGYZ/5/
[07:47:06] <sk3pt1c> can i have jquery do a .remove() on a div but not on a div inside that div?
[07:47:06] <Cork> mikehaas763: apperently its a bug in overlay
[07:47:29] <Guest20560> hello
[07:47:43] <Guest20560> how come this works in firefox and chrome but not ie
[07:47:44] <Cork> sk3pt1c: what should happen to the div inside when its parent is removed?
[07:47:49] <mikehaas763> ah ok so you just put the "load: true" in the overlay() method right?
[07:47:51] <Guest20560> http://jsfiddle.net/zcg26/
[07:47:53] <dangerousdave> xdjuj: worked a treat, thanks
[07:47:57] <Guest20560> can u help?
[07:48:03] <xdjuj> dangerousdave great :)
[07:48:05] <mikehaas763> Cork, how did you find that bug? Or did you just accidentally figure it out?
[07:48:05] <quicksilver> MrDup: then, strip out all that irrelevant rubbish and put a small example on jsfiddle which does the same thing
[07:48:14] <quicksilver> MrDup: and if that has the same problem, we'll fix it.
[07:48:19] <Cork> mikehaas763: and removed the .load() yes
[07:48:27] <quicksilver> MrDup: if it doesn't have the same problem, examine what you stripped out and part of that was the probme,
[07:48:31] <Guest20560> help
[07:48:33] <Guest20560> http://jsfiddle.net/zcg26/
[07:48:39] <Guest20560> why doesnt this work with ie?
[07:48:55] <xdjuj> quicksilver the only difference (big one :p) is that this form is loaded in Ajax
[07:49:25] <Cork> mikehaas763: simple exclution, the new text was put in the dom so the even ran, and if i removed load compleatly it never worked
[07:49:27] <quicksilver> ?unwrap @ sk3pt1c
[07:49:28] <bot-t> sk3pt1c, .unwrap(): Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM, leaving the matched elements in their place. http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[07:49:47] <Cork> mikehaas763: so i simply toled it to load instantly and it worked
[07:50:04] <xdjuj> Guest20560 you should use INPUT TYPE => submit OR <button>
[07:50:13] <mikehaas763> Cork, except now it only load the overlay on the first click :(
[07:50:19] <Guest20560> um
[07:50:23] <mikehaas763> It won't load a second overlay
[07:50:40] <Cork> uh...
[07:51:06] <Guest20560> what are u takl;ing baout
[07:51:20] <sk3pt1c> Cork: i basically don't want remove to unbind and disassociate jquery with the elements
[07:51:21] <Guest20560> will u tell me why it wont work in ie?
[07:51:27] <Cork> mikehaas763: so combind them :)
[07:51:32] <mikehaas763> Cork, leaving the load() at the end make it work
[07:51:37] <Cork> yup :)
[07:52:07] <sk3pt1c> Cork: because i have some social buttons that break when that happens (because the slideshow i'm using .removes each caption to show the next one)
[07:52:15] <Cork> Guest20560: first, please don't use inline js, its a really messy way to write your page
[07:52:17] <Cork> Guest20560: use modern event listners instead
[07:53:03] <Cork> sk3pt1c: so do this:
[07:53:22] <Cork> 1. create a new div var new_parent = $('<div/>');
[07:53:35] <Cork> 2. then append all the elements you want to "save" to it
[07:53:57] <Cork> 3. replace the old div with a the new one
[07:54:56] <Cork> so in code var new_parent = $('<div/>'); new_parent.append($(div).find('.save-me'); $(div).replaceWith(new_parent);
[07:54:58] <MrDup> xdjuj: doesn't work too.
[07:55:16] <codepython777> $(".emailslist").on("click", "a.list-emailships", function(e) { # How do i make this so that it acts like url ("/emails.html") was clicked?
[07:55:18] <MrDup> quicksilver: I think I will see that tomorrow, it's not urgent.
[07:55:24] <Cork> * new_parent.append($(div).find('.save-me'));
[07:55:33] <MrDup> Maybe I'll see something I'm to tired to see. ^^
[07:55:47] <codepython777> do i do window.location= emails.html; ?
[07:55:52] <sk3pt1c> Cork: if i do a .detach() on the div whose associations i want to keep before the slideshow does a .remove on its parent, do i save the associations?
[07:56:19] <Misha|Work> hey guys
[07:56:20] <Cork> Guest20560: at least older ie's uses native window option elements so it doesn't fully see options as normal elements
[07:56:53] <Misha|Work> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#empty-lists
[07:56:55] <Cork> sk3pt1c: depends on where the events ( i suspect thats what you mean with assosiations) are attached
[07:57:08] <Misha|Work> I'm using this feature of jquery ui
[07:57:13] <Misha|Work> I have three litss
[07:57:21] <Misha|Work> and I need to get each list all the li's positions
[07:57:31] <Misha|Work> any idea how I'm doing it?
[07:57:36] <Cork> Guest20560: sorry native select elements, not native options element :)
[07:59:02] <Cork> codepython777: you can't
[07:59:18] <Cork> codepython777: browsers intentionally break that connection
[07:59:26] <sunbeam> I need a good calendar, that where I can black out (select) multiple dates with
[07:59:32] <sunbeam> Any advices
[07:59:57] <Cork> codepython777: you can tell the browser to load the url as the current page, but not emulate that the link was clicked
[08:00:06] <Cork> codepython777: and yes loading is window.location = this.href
[08:00:17] <sk3pt1c> Cork: (bear in mind i'm a virtual noob) i have links in a div inside the caption of each image and i have scripts associated with them outside of the slideshow altogether. these links draw on the scripts to properly display links for twitter, pinterest and facebook. but, from what i gather, since the slideshow is calling a .remove() on a caption to show the next one, the events/associations
[08:00:17] <sk3pt1c> break and the buttons don't display properly. the only one of them that works (no idea why) is the pinterest button.
[08:01:30] <sk3pt1c> Cork: so, in my limited knowledge, i thought maybe i could replace .remove() with .detach() ?
[08:01:52] <Cork> sk3pt1c: sounds like you should prob find a slideshow that doesn't destroy the dom element
[08:02:10] <Cork> sk3pt1c: yes detatch won't destry dom listners
[08:02:14] <xdjuj> codepython777 => window.open( jQuery(this).attr('href') ); e.preventDefault();
[08:02:52] <sk3pt1c> Cork: yeah, i know, but my boss likes this specific one and i can't seem to find another one similar that can support pages of thumbnails too
[08:03:39] <Cork> xdjuj: open will open a popup or a new tab though, and that might not be what he wants
[08:04:23] <sk3pt1c> Cork: so my best bet is to play around with .detach() ?
[08:05:19] <Cork> sk3pt1c: what i'm affraid about is that the slideshow clones the original dom element and uses the clone in the slideshow
[08:06:09] <Cork> sk3pt1c: if so then this won't really help
[08:06:09] <Cork> and if you use detatch you need to reattach it where it needs to be else its destroied just as well
[08:06:43] <Misha|Work> how can I get with jquery get the element position id?
[08:06:54] <Misha|Work> lets say I have like 10 div's on my wrap div
[08:06:59] <sk3pt1c> Cork: how do i reattach? find where it does it and .attach() ?
[08:07:04] <Misha|Work> I want to get each div position number
[08:07:09] <Misha|Work> how can I do it?
[08:07:13] <codepython777> xdjuj: I was going for window.location = "/asdad"; whats the difference between your solution and this one?
[08:07:18] <pachet> i'm not sure what you mean by position number
[08:07:23] <pachet> Misha|Work: but have a look at .index()
[08:07:26] <pachet> ?.index()
[08:07:26] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[08:07:38] <Misha|Work> thanks I'll check it
[08:07:48] <Misha|Work> does jquery ui sortable has index?
[08:08:11] <codepython777> xdjuj: mine is working for sure

[08:13:30] <ML74> Could someone help me with a problem I'm having with the cloud-zoom plugin: http://www.cookstop.co.uk/products/fish-tweezers/. It just doesn't seem to be working at all.
[08:16:21] <pachet> pppaul: or $('.foo').get(0)

[08:16:52] <sk3pt1c> Cork: did you see the script?
[08:16:54] <pachet> advantage with .get() is that you can pull out the whole array of elements if you call it without an argument
[08:20:06] <sk3pt1c> pachet: maybe you could help? Cork seems unresponsive :)
[08:20:22] <Progster> what an easy/quick way of adding a distinct way of selecting one of either two forms on a page (right now I just use a simple toggle of disable on the input elements of either form depending on where the user cliks), and validating the items of the selected form when the user tries to click submit?

[08:22:15] <Cork> sk3pt1c: its way to complex to grasp with out sitting down with it
[08:23:58] <sk3pt1c> Cork: thanks, but i guess it's kind of way out of my league. maybe i could try to strip out any extraneous stuff and try to figure out the basics...

[08:27:52] <fission6> anyone here using session.js
[08:29:22] <fission6> im curious why a cookie isn't set for using html5 location but for fallback methods it is https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L272
[08:34:19] <darkfrog> you can only look up a tag that has been added to the DOM, right?  I can't create a tag, assign an ID, and then look it up, right?
[08:34:49] <NoiseEee> correct, but you can certainly reference it by assigning it to a variable
[08:35:07] <NoiseEee> var p = $('#newTag').html('i am new');   console.log(p);
[08:36:56] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: I've not used jQuery for DOM manipulation much, can you tell me what I'm doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/QQg9t/
[08:37:29] <darkfrog> oops...sorry, document.body fixed it. :o
[08:38:01] <Pistos> I am calling $.get(...) to get an HTML fragment.  Inside the frament, there is a subfragment that I want to extract out, and inject elsewhere in the DOM.  I have tried all manner of detach(), clone(), remove(), replaceWith(), insertBefore() and on and on, but I only get various undesirable results like:
[08:38:24] <fission6> im not blind right, https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L272 is not setting the cookie like the other location methods right
[08:38:31] <Pistos> the subfrag stays with the ajax frag; the replaceWith target disappears, but the subfrag doesn't replace it.
[08:39:11] <Pistos> Are there particular pitfalls with replaceWith I need to be aware of?  Is it wrong to be trying to get the fragment by using $(raw_html_returned_from_ajax) ?
[08:40:30] <MrDup> quicksilver, xdjuj : a collegue found the problem. I had to search into the plugin source but it's ok : In my second example, my form tag was directly under my table tag. My collegue told me "It's not really ok with W3C ".
[08:41:04] <MrDup> Effectively, that's why it didn't find() anything when searching in childs of my form.
[08:41:47] <sunbeam> what do I need to download for jquery datepicker?
[08:41:50] <fission6> is there a way i can call / utilize set_cookie in this code https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L350 from outside the session.js code?
[08:42:01] <xdjuj> MrDup there's other "no w3c things" in your code :)
[08:42:25] <MrDup> xdjuj: yeah, no doubt about this, but I'm a beginner and this is not my code.
[08:42:50] <xdjuj> For example you can't have a link without a <a> :)
[08:43:31] <MrDup> xdjuj: about W3C things, do you know if the chrome's audit is a good tool to clear this ?
[08:45:44] <darkfrog> is there a temporary place I can hide an element on the DOM so it won't be rendered?  I know I can make a hidden floating div and add things to it, but was hoping for an "off-screen" style built-in feature. :)
[08:45:46] <fission6> MrDup: whats chrome's audit?
[08:46:02] <fission6> darkfrog: .hide();
[08:46:22] <darkfrog> fission6: I'm aware of that, but I still have to add it to the dom
[08:46:36] <NoiseEee> just don't add it to the dom
[08:47:10] <NoiseEee> var p = $('<p>').html('A new paragraph element, just sitting around');
[08:47:21] <fission6> darkfrog: dont add it to the dom until you have it as you want it
[08:47:54] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: server-driven changes are coming in via AJAX and creating and adding to the DOM are separate entries...this means I either need to add support for referencing via local variable or looking up via the DOM.  If the item has already been added it will only be on the DOM not in a variable.
[08:48:08] <fission6> NoiseEee: any ideas if i can call set_cookie from a js block outside of session.js ? https://github.com/fission6/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L350
[08:48:34] <NoiseEee> fission6: sorry never used it
[08:48:42] <fission6> darkfrog: you may want to look at something like backbone.js and subscribe to data changes
[08:49:00] <fission6> NoiseEee: i guess its just more of a jquery / js question if i can access that function form outside session.js
[08:49:03] <fission6> does that make sense?
[08:50:25] <ajpiano> fission6: no, you can't
[08:50:39] <fission6> ok thats what i thought.
[08:50:41] <ajpiano> it's kept private inside of that scope intentionally, from what i can tell
[08:50:42] <MrDup> fission6: a tab in development tools of chrome
[08:51:34] <fission6> ajpiano: do you know why the code doesn't set the html5 location in a cookie but does for fallback methods? https://github.com/fission6/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L272
[08:51:38] <fission6> any theories?
[08:52:05] <ajpiano> nope
[08:52:11] <fission6> yea i dont either
[08:52:18] <fission6> i have theories but wish it did
[08:52:26] <darkfrog> fission6: it would appear that backbone.js is more for rich clients with very little logic on the servers.  My scenario is the reverse...I have nearly all the logic on the server and it is being pushed to change the client.
[08:52:42] <fission6> MrDup: is there anything built into chrome to do w3 dom checking?
[08:52:51] <fission6> i wish there was something like that in audit
[08:54:10] <Progster> is there a way to attach an event on an element when a specific attribute is changed?
[09:02:41] <gianiaz> hi, I'm playing with cycle jquery plugin from malsup. Do you now if there's a way to create a pager with thumbnails?^
[09:03:47] <dialman> Progster: Any element, or a specific one?
[09:11:59] <Solow> Naming convention question... If I have a function which is the toolbar "object" (var toolbar = function() { /* ... */ };) how should I then call the "instance" ? because var toolbar = new toolbar(); is going to cause problems.
[09:12:37] <ryanneufeld> Solow: Toolbar = function() {}; var toolbar = new Toolbar()
[09:13:08] <Solow> ryanneufeld: That's the naming convention? Because that is AWESOME.
[09:13:20] <Solow> Keeps me close to php
[09:13:21] <ryanneufeld> Solow: it's a common one
[09:13:28] <ryanneufeld> across many OOP languages
[09:13:33] <Solow> wicked.
[09:13:38] <Solow> Thanks
[09:13:41] <ryanneufeld> np
[09:19:12] <pppaul> i want to remove all attributes from my node
[09:19:22] <pppaul> is there a simple way to do this in jquery?
[09:22:54] <pppaul> you guys all out to lunch?
[09:23:30] <EyePulp> usually
[09:24:59] <pppaul> :D
[09:24:59] <sunbeam> what do I need to download for jquery datepicker?
[09:26:06] <pppaul> jquery
[09:37:48] <xdjuj> sunbeam
[09:37:52] <xdjuj> jQuery UI
[09:38:10] <TimothyA> what's the best way to make a form submit after I have sent an AJAX request to check if the values put in are correct?
[09:39:13] <TimothyA> copying the entity and filling it with the data on submission seems a bit clunky to me
[09:40:49] <xdjuj> TimothyA I'm not sure to understand
[09:40:50] <TimothyA> setting a form attribute and calling submit() again?
[09:43:26] <NoiseEee> why is an ajax request determining if values are 'correct'?
[09:43:38] <NoiseEee> why not just a form submission with some brief validation via JS only?
[09:44:03] <NoiseEee> you can have your xhr request send back 'hey, its a good form!!' and I can *still* alter the contents before submitting it to the backend
[09:44:24] <vladyn> hola guys, any idea for good encoder for html5 video formats (mac) .ogg, .mpg4, .webm
[09:44:40] <vladyn> no flash with nice degradation
[09:46:22] <TimothyA> NoiseEee: .....
[09:46:37] <TimothyA> NoiseEee: I can disable javascript and STILL alter the contents before submitting it to the backend
[09:46:55] <TimothyA> the thing is that the javascript ajax validation I'm doing is the exact same as the backend validation I'm doing
[09:46:58] <NoiseEee> TimothyA: no offense, but "what's the best way to make a form submit after I have sent an AJAX request to check if the values put in are correct?" is a very strange question.
[09:47:04] <TimothyA> so no duplicate code in 2 different languages
[09:47:11] <NoiseEee> TimothyA: then keep it on the backend
[09:47:15] <TimothyA> ...
[09:47:17] <NoiseEee> TimothyA: front side validation is convenience only.
[09:47:22] <TimothyA> which it is
[09:47:40] <TimothyA> if I can just tack it on with 10 lines to use the backend validation, so much better
[09:47:45] <TimothyA> keeping everything in a single place
[09:47:46] <Ziggy`> I have an live event (.on) for mouseenter, can I somehow trigger a mouseenter myself for this kind of event? $('.element').trigger('hover'); and $('.element').hover(); nor anything else I've tried works.
[09:47:50] <Ziggy`> an/a
[09:47:56] <TimothyA> I can tolerate the extra requests
[09:48:32] <TimothyA> NoiseEee: but there are some additional validation rules which are impossible to do with javascript, if not downright illegal and insecure
[09:48:37] <Ziggy`> Is there any way to trigger live events with jQuery 1.7?
[09:48:51] <TimothyA> such as matching someone's telephone address with an address
[09:48:59] <TimothyA> you're not going to do that in pure javascript
[09:53:07] <HyperXSystems> Ziggy: trigger should work, just make sure to use the same string in the method as you did on the bind
[09:55:35] <Progster> what would be a good way of allowing a user to select two different forms for two different ways of submitting information? i initially coded this as enabling/disabling the inputs in each form, but the problem is that disabled elements don't propagate click events, so this doesn't work unless I'm clicking right outside of the disabled elements. I just need a good visual cue for the user, but
[09:55:35] <Progster> it would also be nice if elements were disabled so they get a clear sense of which input mechanism they're using
[09:56:54] <NoiseEee> Progster: you can try working with 'readonly' instead of disable, and style appropriately
[09:57:09] <NoiseEee> iirc readonly will propagate events, get submitted in forms, etc
[09:57:40] <Progster> the thing is, I'm using h5validate, so I assume I'll have to enclose each logical form in it's own form and validate accordingly
[09:57:59] <Progster> I think that the issue with this is that html5 validation will kick in if something is readonly. It doesn't kick in if an element is disabled
[09:58:12] <illoomn8> http://codepad.org/G4vejPQt can anyone tell me why the first definition works but the second does not?
[09:58:26] <Progster> and I'm using h5validate
[10:01:40] <vitorr> hi! I have two ajax requests being sent on the SAME event (onblur of a textfield), with two completely different callbacks. Apparently the success callback of the second one is being executed for BOTH requests, no matter the order the requests are, and things get fucked up. I don't know if it is a bad practice (more than one ajax call on the same js event), but is there any known issue on this
[10:01:40] <vitorr> subject?
[10:02:47] <NoiseEee> illoomn8: its how JS works.  in second statement, "test(0)" is being executed immediately, once that line is read
[10:03:46] <vitorr> I'm using 1.4.4 btw
[10:05:26] <Ziggy`> Using done: and complete: with .ajax, it seems complete get's called before done: has finished executing, What can I do to be assured that done has finished executing everything?

[10:18:31] <Guest1625> el and yourotherel what is? Aamir
[10:18:54] <Aamir> Guest1625:  the elements to which you are binding your events
[10:19:21] <Aamir> so all I get from your question is that you want to use same function on two different events
[10:19:32] <Aamir> so this is how you can find same function to two events
[10:19:37] <BucketofTruth> so i've made a couple functions i call in header.php to handle maintaining scripts.. does this make sense to people, or do others have a different approach? https://gist.github.com/3417483

[11:24:02] <Guest1625> i dont have used the bind
[11:24:03] <SirMatt> When your done, may I ask something NodeX
[11:24:09] <Guest1625> but
[11:24:16] <Guest1625> i have try with that
[11:24:19] <NodeX> SirMatt : just ask dude ;)
[11:24:27] <Guest1625> but not work
[11:24:36] <SirMatt> oh ok, one second
[11:24:39] <Guest1625> can you help me with that?
[11:25:17] <NodeX> Guest1625 : I am asking do you want to bind to both keypress and submit?
[11:25:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> does anyone know how ot include just the jquery datepicker? I already made a custom library, but it's not included...
[11:25:37] <Guest1625> yes
[11:26:14] <NodeX> you need to use bind() and you can use more than one name
[11:26:44] <NodeX> for example ... $("#test, form").bind('keypress submit',function(event){....});
[11:26:54] <BinaryKitten> please use .on
[11:27:13] <Guest1625> i will show you what i have do
[11:27:46] <NodeX> or that
[11:27:54] <Guest1625> http://jsfiddle.net/nYDsf/8/
[11:28:02] <Guest1625> is that correctly?
[11:28:30] <wenzhixue> anyone used facebook javascript api with backbone js ? i have a urgent question ...
[11:29:00] <SirMatt> I have 2 li's and when there clicked on I want the ul in that li to appear and when something but the ul in the li thats showing to make the ul in the li thats showing to disappear or hide
[11:29:30] <NodeX> SirMatt : that kinda makes no sense, can you put together a jsfiddle?
[11:30:03] <SirMatt> yeah I'm working on making it a little nicer
[11:30:13] <wenzhixue> anyone used facebook javascript api with backbone js ? i have a urgent question ...
[11:30:38] <Guest1625> NodeX it is correctly this http://jsfiddle.net/nYDsf/8/
[11:30:39] <Guest1625> ?
[11:30:53] <NodeX> More like this
[11:30:54] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/nYDsf/9/
[11:31:43] <BinaryKitten> actually Guest13539 you're not far off
[11:31:59] <NodeX> [19:26:53] <BinaryKitten> please use .on
[11:32:00] <NodeX> LOL
[11:32:12] <NodeX> change youre mind again ?
[11:32:17] <NodeX> your*
[11:33:40] <BinaryKitten> NodeX?
[11:33:46] <SirMatt> http://jsfiddle.net/EmAFK/
[11:33:52] <BinaryKitten> Guest13539: http://jsfiddle.net/nYDsf/12/
[11:33:52] <NodeX> you said "please use on"
[11:34:03] <BinaryKitten> yes, please .on   not .bind
[11:34:03] <NodeX> then he uses bind and you agreew with it
[11:34:10] <NodeX> slightly confusing no?
[11:34:13] <BinaryKitten> i saiod that he's not far off
[11:34:26] <wenzhixue> anyone can help me a little about facebook javascript api and backbone js... i have a problem to call the api... i just can't get any response.. here is my index.html http://pastebin.com/QSB4Rxw2
[11:34:29] <NodeX> and you missed the point
[11:34:39] <NodeX> he wanted to bind to submit and to keypress
[11:34:47] <NodeX> (form submit)
[11:34:50] <shiftingcontrol> what does $('a', text) actually means if I google this I get .text(), if replace text with blah I get some other relevant blah content nothing matches this semantics
[11:34:56] <BinaryKitten> wenzhixue sorry wrong channel
[11:35:12] <BinaryKitten> NodeX but from the code, there is 2 different constraints
[11:35:27] <Milos> yes
[11:35:31] <NodeX> yes but it doesnt show how to bind to 2 different elements
[11:35:33] <Milos> I was going to mention this as well
[11:36:05] <NodeX> SirMatt : you can stop the propogation if you need to
[11:36:09] <NodeX> is that what you're after?
[11:36:42] <nerk> good day, i am getting $.getJSON returning errors about origin policy.. after investigating the call, it doesn't seem to be generating the random callback param.  call looks like $.getJSON(hostVar + '/somepage.go?name=' + name + '&start='+startDate+'&jsoncallback=?', function(data) { //do stuff }); jsoncallback gets passed as ?\
[11:36:50] <Guest1625> thanks all
[11:36:54] <Milos> propagation btw, not propo
[11:36:58] <nerk> any ideas why that would be?
[11:37:05] <NodeX> Cool story spelling nazi :P
[11:37:13] <Milos> I'm also a grammar nazi
[11:37:19] <NodeX> awesome
[11:37:22] <NoiseEee> im just a good ol' regular nazi nazi
[11:37:22] <Milos> I have VERY cool stories :)
[11:38:25] <BinaryKitten> Milos, put them in teh microwave. That should warm them up a little
[11:38:37] <SirMatt> I think so, I found some code that had that but I wasn't sure what it did, but I saw a problem kinda, I think that code was seperate and didn't have "this" in it so if I had one of the things showing it would still be showing when I click on the other one I think
[11:38:38] <Milos> what, my stories?
[11:38:47] <Milos> oh.
[11:38:49] <Milos> I get it.
[11:38:54] <Guest1625> but i but nothing of this its work with submit method?
[11:38:54] <Milos> "cool" stories.
[11:39:21] <Milos> I'm afraid you're going to have to learn English a bit more.
[11:39:21] <niix> ok I found a way to loop over my events from my db https://gist.github.com/3418208, now the issue is if there is more than one event then it won't work because there is not for loop that is generating the whole JS event thing, is this something I can do in the template language or would I do it on the front end with JS?
[11:40:02] <BinaryKitten> niix is that a jQuery issue?
[11:40:14] <niix> potentially :-]
[11:40:42] <dgs_> i'm having issues with an ajaxStart event on a form. I have multiple forms on the page, and am attaching an event via $('form').ajaxStart(e){…}  - I would expect that to fire once for the form is currently been submitted, but instead as soon as any form submits it's fires simultaneously for each form on the page.  What should be the expected behaviour here? Firing once, or firing multiple times?  https://gist.github.com/3418191 <-- actual code
[11:40:49] <SirMatt> NodeX, do you understand what I'm saying?
[11:41:08] <Milos> dgs_, 'form' selects every form
[11:41:22] <BinaryKitten> dgs_ also ajaxStart is for ALL ajax starts
[11:41:34] <BinaryKitten> not just ajaxStarts on that element
[11:41:36] <Guest1625> NodeX none of that code work with live validation and submit press
[11:42:04] <Milos> Guest1625, has anything worked for you in the past 3 hours?
[11:42:30] <dgs_> milos:  I need to use $('form')  (i think) as  I want to attach the event to all forms … (i just don't want them all to fire at the same time)
[11:42:46] <Milos> dgs_, I see. In that case, BinaryKitten has the reason.
[11:42:58] <Guest1625> what question is this
[11:43:18] <Milos> The one I just asked.
[11:44:33] <fission6> anyone have a good geolocation with fallback script
[11:45:45] <buddyq> jrockjiggz: can you help once more? I want to wrap each "node" as well with another <span class="second-word">. You can see what I want to wrap if you open the console.
[11:45:56] <dgs_> agh, i think I see. I didn't realise that their were global / local events
[11:46:11] <dgs_> hmm, that was meant for Milos and BinaryKitten  :p
[11:46:23] <Milos> :)
[11:46:23] <SirMatt> I still need some help please.
[11:47:08] <nerk> does anyone know any reason why $.getJSON will not convert &callback=? to the randomized callback name?  just passes through as &callback=?
[11:47:38] <buddyq> console.log(node) produces output in brackets. What type of object is that?
[11:47:46] <buddyq> [" output1"]
[11:47:53] <ak> nerk pass it as part of the url, not as parameter would be my gues
[11:47:59] <SirMatt> http://jsfiddle.net/EmAFK/
[11:47:59] <nerk> console.log(typeof node)
[11:48:01] <Milos> SirMatt, you haven't really asked a question, and the paste you've shown doesn't explain what you want.
[11:48:02] <nerk> but array
[11:48:22] <nerk> ak, it is passed as part of the url.
[11:48:23] <buddyq> says object
[11:48:32] <dgs_> i've swapped out ajaxStart for beforeSend (which according to the docs seems to be the local event I need to use). However $('form').beforeSend{…} raises an error: Object [object Object] has no method 'beforeSend'
[11:48:36] <Milos> I'm looking at the paste and it says "Look Here". Alright, I'm looking.
[11:48:49] <ak> nerk: can you provide a jsfiddle then please, i can take a look at it...
[11:48:51] <dgs_> can I only attach that event to certain types of objects?
[11:48:54] <nerk> ak: $.getJSON(hostVar + '/somepage.go?name=' + name + '&start='+startDate+'&jcallback=?', function(data) { //do stuff });
[11:49:08] <nerk> err.. and it's callback
[11:49:10] <nerk> not jcallback
[11:50:17] <buddyq> So i node an array object? Typeof gives object as result. but prints [" output1"] for example. SO how can I wrap "output1" with a <span>?
[11:50:41] <ak> nerk: i got some idea...
[11:51:02] <hlveheart> idea, or ideas plural?
[11:51:03] <hlveheart> o_O
[11:51:11] <Milos> O_o
[11:51:31] <hlveheart> o.O
[11:51:36] <Milos> O.o
[11:51:40] <hlveheart> i got a case of the tooooosdays
[11:51:54] <Milos> Me too. Also, I'm hungry.
[11:52:03] <hlveheart> I'm sick as a dog. I retardedly stayed up all night
[11:52:03] <ak> $.getJSON('/somepage.go?callback=?', {name: name, start: startDate}, function()...) <- nerk
[11:52:30] <Milos> Go to bed now! Then have soup in the morning.
[11:52:53] <nerk> ak
[11:52:55] <nerk> funny
[11:53:00] <nerk> I just suggested that to the developer
[11:53:01] <nerk> lol
[11:53:15] <nerk> might do it
[11:53:28] <nerk> cuz I think it may be related to the url being encoded vs. not
[11:53:44] <ak> btw, try to use $.ajax() always...
[11:54:25] <ak> i think it forces you a bit, to make better code... or not... :)
[11:55:28] <MaxymiserTE> Hi. Is there a way to truncate a div to limit it to 29 words then append an ellipsis to it?
[11:55:46] <MaxymiserTE> The divs content is coming from an ajax request
[11:55:54] <ak> there is :)
[11:55:56] <ColKurtz> MaxymiserTE, yes i've seen such a plugin
[11:56:10] <ColKurtz> I believe from the maker of CarouFredSel
[11:56:21] <MaxymiserTE> Is it standard jquery?
[11:56:27] <MaxymiserTE> or just javascript?
[11:56:43] <MaxymiserTE> i can only add scripts, not add external files
[11:56:56] <the_jeebster> hi guys, I'm listening to window scrolling with the jquery .scroll() function
[11:57:02] <ColKurtz> I'm sorry, what do you mean MaxymiserTE ?
[11:57:04] <ColKurtz> It's a jQuery plugin
[11:57:04] <the_jeebster> is there a way to end listening to scroll?
[11:57:12] <ak> to truncate plain js is better, to append stuff jquery is nice to have
[11:57:14] <MaxymiserTE> is that the only way to do it?
[11:57:30] <ColKurtz> I'm sure there are lots of ways to do it
[11:57:37] <ColKurtz> I was just offering up an easy solution I had seen before.
[11:58:30] <ColKurtz> the_jeebster, I've seen a blog post from Ben Alman regarding techniques for throttling the resize & scroll events
[11:58:34] <ColKurtz> could be relevant
[11:58:53] <the_jeebster> ColKurtz: can I just perform $(window).unbind("scroll");
[11:58:58] <ColKurtz> actually, the_jeebster, if you have somethin
[11:59:01] <ColKurtz> yeah I was just gonna say that
[11:59:01] <ColKurtz> lol
[11:59:18] <the_jeebster> cool, thanks for the heads up
[12:02:14] <buddyq> Hey guys here is jsfiddle of my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/9AXvN/449/
[12:02:30] <buddyq> I am trying to put spans around each word with its own class.
[12:04:00] <buddyq> if you check your console, you'll see that it prints what I want to wrap in a span with "second-word"
[12:04:16] <ak> buddyq: hmm
[12:04:36] <ak> what do you want here again? what is own class
[12:05:09] <buddyq> Basically I want to take wrap the two words in <h4><a>.
[12:05:23] <buddyq> They will be limited to a 2 word title for this particular place.
[12:05:40] <buddyq> but I need to style the two words differently so I need the classes.
[12:06:58] <ak> so there are 2 world: Home insurance -> you want <span class="home">Home</span><span class="insurance">Insurance</span>
[12:07:06] <ak> right buddyq ?
[12:07:20] <buddyq> yes
[12:07:32] <NoiseEee> also buddyq, you know that you can target that second word via CSS without a class around it specifically?
[12:07:38] <buddyq> could be class="word1" word2 for all I care.
[12:07:46] <ak> should it always be the word as a class, or more like "first" and "second" ?
[12:07:53] <nerk> ak: why should I always use $.ajax?
[12:08:04] <buddyq> first second word just fine
[12:08:10] <ak> nerk: it forces you to know what you are doing :)
[12:08:14] <nerk> due to $.getJSON shady method of continually head tag injection?
[12:08:26] <buddyq> position rule is going to be used in css for the second word.
[12:08:39] <ak> buddyq: i take a look ...
[12:08:45] <buddyq> k
[12:09:04] <nerk> ak: I have never had trouble with $.getJSON before.
[12:09:17] <clop> if I had a server slowly printing plain-text update messages, and I wanted to display them in the browser in a <pre> tag as they were generated, would jquery's ajax stuff be able to do that?
[12:09:51] <nerk> but, I should start using $.ajax as it now fully supports cross domain calls
[12:10:05] <codepython777> http://pbin.be/show/784/ -- can anyone tell me how to solve this access problem?
[12:10:32] <nerk> when I started using $.getJSON it was the only way to retrieve data cross domain with jquery ajax.
[12:10:57] <nerk> what is it.. since 1.6.x they added cross domain flags to $.ajax?
[12:15:13] <nirvanaout11> can somebody help me out please
[12:15:14] <nirvanaout11> curvyCorners(settingsObj, DOMObj1[, DOMObj2[, DOMObj3[, DOMObjN]]]);
[12:15:16] <ColKurtz> uh getJSON shouldn't work unless you're using JSONP, or have CORS enabled
[12:15:17] <lduros> hi, does anyone know of a plugin that takes the value of a <p> tag or other element and convert the element to an input (with the value set as text) on focus/click?
[12:15:20] <ColKurtz> cross domain that is
[12:15:25] <lduros> I guess I could come up with my own little piece of code
[12:15:28] <lduros> not very difficult
[12:15:31] <ColKurtz> lduros, sounds easy enough
[12:15:44] <lduros> yeh, the time to explain is basically the same as writing it
[12:15:45] <lduros> haha
[12:15:57] <nirvanaout11> hello
[12:16:07] <nirvanaout11> somebody knows java here? please help
[12:16:08] <nirvanaout11> curvyCorners(settingsObj, DOMObj1[, DOMObj2[, DOMObj3[, DOMObjN]]]);
[12:16:13] <nirvanaout11> how to use this
[12:16:24] <lduros> you mean javascript?
[12:16:38] <nirvanaout11> i am not even sure what it is written in, sorry
[12:16:44] <nirvanaout11> i guess it is javascript yes
[12:17:02] <lduros> it's a little weird that you have [, next to each other
[12:17:28] <ak> buddyq: still here? :)
[12:17:36] <buddyq> yes
[12:17:42] <nirvanaout11> i tried to use it like this   but does not work
[12:17:42] <ak> http://jsfiddle.net/Tje9a/7/

[12:18:26] <buddyq> Holy moley.... nice and consice!
[12:18:30] <buddyq> spelled wrong
[12:18:51] <ak> this should work for any numbers of word and stuff
[12:18:57] <ak> words*

[12:19:21] <nirvanaout11> but dont know how to use it for multiple divs or #ids
[12:19:39] <ak> nerk: getjson, and every other "ajax" like function is only some alias to $.ajax(), it only invokes more function calls..
[12:19:44] <nirvanaout11> is there a better script you can use than curvy corners?
[12:20:29] <nirvanaout11> can somebody help me out here?
[12:20:36] <zettazete> Hey guys, I've been banging my head over this for the past hour. I am working with wordpress plugins, and I know my programming is really crappy but could someone help me out? The Jquery UI draggable isn't working properly. http://pastebin.com/ZzbeD48b Thank you in advance.
[12:21:08] <zettazete> I'm assuming I have some syntax error that firebug isn't telling me about.
[12:21:57] <ak> zettazete: try to get only the js from your code, and put it on jsfiddle, i can help you then...
[12:22:12] <ColKurtz> nirvanaout11, I would simply use CSS3's border-radius
[12:22:30] <ColKurtz> combine with the CSS3 PIE for IE support
[12:24:57] <codepython777> anyone can help me with a selector: http://pbin.be/show/784/
[12:25:57] <zettazete> ak: http://jsfiddle.net/wduRM/ it looks so simple now. However I still don't spot the issue.
[12:26:41] <ak> one sec
[12:27:11] <codepython777> I think i got it down to one element
[12:27:12] <ak> codepython777: $(this).closest('tr').find('td b')
[12:28:05] <codepython777> ak: thanks.
[12:29:32] <codepython777> Ak: for some reason it selects multiple elements. (header <b> tags are also selected.)
[12:30:11] <ak> ah in the example are no other b tags :)
[12:30:31] <ak> but i would add some class to that email container for some easy selection
[12:30:35] <codepython777> there is another row on top of the table which uses b tags
[12:30:53] <ak> can you add a class to the email row?
[12:32:02] <ak> zettazete: http://jsfiddle.net/yxabr/3/
[12:33:37] <zettazete> ak, so basically I have to include the css portion?
[12:34:11] <ak> no, i just made it to make it a bit greener, it should work without it
[12:34:27] <ak> also you only need the first line of the javascript
[12:34:28] <codepython777> ak: done , thanks
[12:34:41] <zettazete> Ah ok. Thanks I'll expirement a bit more. (Yea, I didn't cut enough of my js off.)
[12:46:23] <zettazete> ak, ok its identical in my wordpress plugin and its not working at all. :/
[12:46:51] <ak> well you need to include jquery and jquery ui stuff...
[12:47:00] <ak> with css and all that
[12:47:51] <zettazete> ak, which I have it working on another page without any trouble. However that is with it programmed right into a page.
[12:48:56] <ak> well something is missing somewhere, maybe check the output in chrome console...
[12:51:03] <zettazete> "[cycle] terminating; too few slides: 0 " that mean anything?
[12:51:38] <xckpd7> let's say I have a variable... is there any way programmatically to target that variable by generating it based on strings
[12:52:06] <tw2113> you don't have 2+ slides zettazete
[12:52:21] <tw2113> so it just shows the 1
[12:52:28] <tw2113> and stops the rest of the script
[12:52:37] <xckpd7> like let's say I have fooNice and blahNice. Let's say I want to programatically target either. Once I figure out which one I want to target, can I build the variable I want to target? for example chosen + Nice
[12:52:43] <zettazete> Ah, so basically my script isn't working because I don't have enough slides?
[12:52:51] <tw2113> most likely, yes
[12:52:52] <xckpd7> var chosen + 'Nice' = blah
[12:53:09] <tw2113> add a 2nd one and see if magic happens
[12:53:25] <rmill> if cycle is spitting that out
[12:53:27] <ak> xckpd7: if you make a var, it will be a property of the window object, so you could use: window[chosen + 'Nice']
[12:53:28] <rmill> it's most certainly working
[12:53:41] * tw2113 has enough experience with jquery cycle to know this much
[12:53:44] <rmill> you either a) don't have it targeting the right el or b) don't have enough slides
[12:54:17] <alexd08> hi
[12:54:22] <zettazete> tw2113, I just start jquery just a couple of days ago. I do not fully understand cycles.
[12:54:23] <rmill> HAI!
[12:54:31] <tw2113> it's a plugin :)
[12:54:37] <tw2113> </captainobvious>
[12:54:47] <PhanLord> is there a bug with jquery 1.8 and chrome ? im getting Object [object Window] has no method trigger
[12:54:48] <alexd08> has anyone tried integrating jquery-ui's autocomplete widget with Emberjs?
[12:55:31] <zettazete> so wait, why would I be getting this error when I'm not using it? Does the jQuery ui use it?

[12:59:34] <zettazete> tw2113, I don't get it. I'm not even using the cycles plugin?
[12:59:52] <rmill> dlam: I found a thing: http://static.gamesradar.com/19452/js/clacking.js
[13:00:18] <dlam> LOL LOL
[13:00:24] <dlam> rmill wins
[13:00:29] <dlam> ahahhahahahahah
[13:00:35] <rmill> this looks... weird.
[13:00:58] <sunbeam> is it possible to use your own html with jquery datepicker?
[13:01:09] <rmill> function addLink(selector, label, addtext) { clinks_to_clack.push(new clink(selector, label, addtext)); };
[13:01:24] * rmill wishes he had some clinks to clack
[13:01:54] <dlam> =\
[13:02:19] <rmill> sunbeam: you can style UI to your hearts content.
[13:02:21] <dlam> looks like it rewrites links to go to google analytics or something
[13:02:44] <rmill> dlam: all I know is, it looks weak.
[13:02:55] <rmill> addLink() addLink() addLink()
[13:04:21] <zettazete> Can anybody explain why I"m getting this "[cycle] terminating; too few slides: 0" When I"m not even using the cycles plugin?
[13:05:36] <tubbo> hi, i'm getting this error when i make a POST request using ajaxSubmit... "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://development.api.elocal.com/lead. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[13:05:43] <tubbo> that header is set to "*" on the server
[13:05:50] <tubbo> how am i setting an origin of 'null'?
[13:06:01] <Nirvana> can somebody help me with the code?
[13:06:03] <rmill> zettazete: do you have a live link?
[13:06:18] <rmill> zettazete: you can query me if you don't want the whole world to see it...
[13:06:39] <sunbeam> rmill: any idea how?
[13:06:40] <zettazete> Eh, I don't care if other people see it. http://csigaming.tv/livestream/
[13:06:40] <ak> what code Nirvana ?
[13:06:55] <Nirvana> javascript
[13:07:08] <ak> >.<
[13:07:31] <Nirvana> curvyCorners(settingsObj, DOMObj1[, DOMObj2[, DOMObj3[, . . . [, DOMObjN]]]]);
[13:07:31] <rmill> http://rmill.ca/_/facepalm.jpg
[13:07:40] <Nirvana> what does it mean
[13:07:45] <Nirvana> http://www.curvycorners.net/instructions/
[13:08:06] <rmill> It means, "put curvy corners here"
[13:08:06] <zettazete> rmill, yay I made a stupid mistake! :D
[13:08:13] <vitorr> (again) I have two ajax requests being sent on the SAME event (onblur of a textfield), with two completely different callbacks. Apparently the success callback of the second one is being executed for BOTH requests, no matter the order the requests are, and things get fucked up. I don't know if it is a bad practice (more than one ajax call on the same js event), but is there any known issue on
[13:08:13] <vitorr> this subject?
[13:08:19] <rmill> zettazete: WOOT
[13:08:34] <zettazete> rmill, however, it still shows that error. -.-
[13:09:07] <rmill> zettazete: kinda hard to debug without a link :(
[13:09:25] <zettazete> rmill, http://csigaming.tv/livestream/
[13:09:44] <zettazete> however, if you go the Page link the header. you can see the desired result.
[13:10:11] <zettazete> Livestream is the plugin intergration and the Page is me testing the code.
[13:11:28] <rmill> zettazete: frontend.js:8
[13:11:29] <Nirvana> ak ? any help?
[13:11:34] <rmill> line 8
[13:11:48] <rmill> Nirvana: what's there to understand?
[13:12:07] <Nirvana> how to use this curvyCorners(settingsObj, DOMObj1[, DOMObj2[, DOMObj3[, . . . [, DOMObjN]]]]);
[13:12:13] <Nirvana> with multiple divs
[13:12:50] <NoiseEee> vitorr: so you're saying that an event fires two XHR requests... why *wouldn't* the success callback be fired for both requests???
[13:12:51] <rmill> Nirvana: if you can't comprehend documentation -__-
[13:13:07] <tw2113> rmill, zettazete function e() {
[13:13:08] <tw2113> if (window.console && console.log) console.log("[cycle] " + Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, " "))
[13:13:08] <tw2113> }
[13:13:22] <tw2113> line 724 unminimized
[13:13:27] <Nirvana> i cant mill
[13:13:56] <Nirvana> this is what i have only for one div
[13:13:56] <Nirvana> var divObj = document.getElementById("myDiv");
[13:13:57] <Nirvana>    curvyCorners(settings, ".zone-content");
[13:14:08] <Nirvana> but i need to set it up for several divs on the site
[13:14:20] <tw2113> looks like livetv bundle or whatever checks for it?
[13:14:47] <rmill> Nirvana: why are you even using this?
[13:14:54] <rmill> css border radius is good
[13:16:14] <rmill> Nirvana: http://caniuse.com/#feat=border-radius
[13:16:21] <rmill> works pretty much everywhere.
[13:16:25] <Nirvana> not supported in IE
[13:16:33] <Nirvana> i know border radious
[13:16:34] <rmill> The universe doesn't care.
[13:16:37] <vitorr> NoiseEee yes, that's the problem. The same (last fired or first to response) callback is executed for both
[13:16:54] <Nirvana> it will look horrible in IE +rmill
[13:16:59] <tw2113> IE-dinoversion can have square corners, imho
[13:17:08] <vitorr> NoiseEee if I set async=false, it will work (each request will execute it's respective callback)
[13:17:13] <NoiseEee> vitorr: but of course it does.  you have two XHR calls going out, they are BOTH going to have success callbacks.
[13:17:14] <rmill> ya - I think most people are fine with the fallback
[13:17:15] <rmill> vs
[13:17:22] <rmill> shady JS to make rounded corners.
[13:17:27] <NoiseEee> vitorr: is your real question 'how can i just issue a single XHR request?'
[13:17:39] <NoiseEee> http://css3please.com/ @ Nirvana
[13:17:48] <rmill> NoiseEee: he wants two
[13:17:54] <NoiseEee> NOT TWO
[13:17:59] <rmill> he just wants to juggle them.
[13:18:54] <zettazete> rmill, so you said there was an error at line 8?
[13:19:06] <rmill> zettazete: not an error
[13:19:16] <vitorr> NoiseEee each XHR call has it's callback right?
[13:19:17] <rmill> that's just where the cycle stuff is being executed.
[13:19:34] <NoiseEee> vitorr: right, but you said that two XHRs are being fired at once.
[13:19:54] <rmill> vitorr: you just want to kick something off after _both_ XHR's are finished/successful, rite?
[13:20:10] <zettazete> Ah rmill, well I don't need it so. Now to figure out everything! :D Thanks.
[13:20:16] <vitorr> hmm
[13:20:25] <rmill> just have a count (if you know there's two, and you're always going to have two...)
[13:20:40] <tw2113> line 724 rmill zettazete
[13:20:46] <tw2113> unminimized :P
[13:21:33] <rmill> tw2113: unminiFIED FTFY
[13:21:53] <vitorr> if I have like onblur="ajaxRequestOne();ajaxRequestTwo();" and each of these methods make a XHR call, this counts as 'at once'?
[13:22:19] <tw2113> brain fried
[13:22:26] <rmill> tw2113: :)
[13:22:26] <zettazete> Alright I removed the cycle execution. I'm still not getting anything in the console.
[13:22:52] <tw2113> really that was a console log that didn't need to be worried about
[13:23:05] <NoiseEee> vitorr: yes.
[13:23:10] <NoiseEee> vitorr: both are immediately executed.
[13:23:15] <vitorr> hm
[13:23:30] <zettazete> Ah, well still nothing on my draggable content. So I"m removing things as they come. XD
[13:23:31] <rmill> ?ajax101
[13:23:32] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[13:23:40] <rmill> TROLOLO
[13:23:45] <vitorr> NoiseEee well, that I sure didn't know about :P
[13:26:08] <xarxer> is it possible to select all links which are not surrounded by <p> (at any level)?
[13:26:14] <vitorr> NoiseEee so if I do multi XHR calls on the same event, the callback of the last one in sequence will prevail?
[13:26:33] <PhanLord> anyway to get info if any jquery-ui dialog is currently open ?
[13:26:55] <NoiseEee> vitorr: no, they will both fire their callbacks... but the order cannot be depended upon.  sometimes the second will finish before the first...
[13:27:37] <ajpiano> PhanLord: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#method-isOpen
[13:27:41] <gustehn1> hey got some json decoding problems. anyone up for some questions?
[13:27:47] <NoiseEee> vitorr: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ "Callback Function Queues"
[13:28:10] <PhanLord> ajpiano thats only if i know which exact dialog to check for
[13:28:29] <ajpiano> you don't know which dialog you want to check is open?
[13:28:37] <PhanLord> no i dont
[13:28:37] <vitorr> NoiseEee hum
[13:29:01] <PhanLord> just need to know if anyone is open
[13:29:11] <NoiseEee> vitorr: you can also fire off xhr2 as the callback of xhr1
[13:29:12] <PhanLord> BTW modal dialogs for sure
[13:29:23] <vitorr> NoiseEee yes, that's the first solution that came to mind
[13:29:33] <vitorr> NoiseEee i'm not worried about ordering of callbacks execution
[13:29:34] <ajpiano> PhanLord: you can do a bunch of things
[13:29:48] <NoiseEee> vitorr: but in that case.... xhr1 should just probably do the thing that xhr2 does anyways
[13:29:49] <gustehn1> I get this [{"key":"testkey1","id":"test23"},{"key":"testkey","test":"test1"}] for example from server and the variable is called data. I try to do data.key[0] and I dont get testkey1 back. I get nothing
[13:29:51] <vitorr> NoiseEee problem is that always the second callback is executed for BOTH of the requests
[13:30:01] <ajpiano> PhanLord: for instance, $(".ui-dialog").filter(":visible').length would probably do the trick
[13:30:58] <PhanLord> thx
[13:31:03] <PhanLord> that will do it
[13:31:46] <vitorr> NoiseEee but that happens only when it has two or more calls on the same js event, it seems.. I've made many tests (using the same API we developed) on multiple elements and different events, always the right callback was executed, but it was always one request per event
[13:34:26] <NoiseEee> vitorr: i think there are illusions at play.  i can't see why the success callback on xhr2 would be fired on xhr1 unless you've used the same variable names.... my bet is that you're just seeing xhr2's callback happen because it successfully completed alongside/before/after xhr1
[13:36:13] <vitorr> NoiseEee yeah i know it may look like that but it isn't.. I'm aware of the asynchronous aspect of the request :P
[13:36:32] <peterschmidler> Shouldn't $(document).ready be fired before $(window).load function, because in IE10 it is the opposite
[13:39:17] <vitorr> NoiseEee we made a test here changing the order of the calls.. and then the callback of the second one (which was the first one previously) was executed twice. And then removing the second call, the callback of the first one was correctly executed
[13:39:24] <vitorr> NoiseEee i'm confused as fuck
[13:39:27] <EnginA> is there any well known well abstracted library, guidelines, best practices, frameworks to handle back/forward buttons in a totally ajax driven page
[13:40:15] <ajpiano> vitorr: it's getting to the point where you should probably show a reduced test case or example
[13:40:25] <ajpiano> instead of just playing telephone with us and your code :p
[13:40:45] <vitorr> guess you're right
[13:40:48] <vitorr> :|
[13:40:57] <ajpiano> EnginA: there are many so called "routing" frameworks
[13:41:11] <rmill> I made a thingy anyway vitorr: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/Z9NvR/
[13:41:12] <ajpiano> there's jQuery.bbq, history.js, sammy.js, backbone.js's router, etc.
[13:42:02] <rmill> anyway, kind of a dumb example.
[13:42:23] <vitorr> hm
[13:42:57] <sunbeam> how can i change in the jquery ui datepicker that it doesn't show like August 2012 but only August?
[13:43:07] <EnginA> ajpiano: any recommendations ?
[13:43:13] <ajpiano> i just gave you 4
[13:43:14] <ajpiano> ...
[13:43:29] <EnginA> any prefernces...
[13:43:41] <ajpiano> i use backbone cause i write apps in backbone
[13:43:48] <EnginA> ok
[13:44:43] <vitorr> rmill hm that example of yours tells me when both of them are executed, is that right?
[13:45:01] <rmill> vitorr: also, ignore parseURL thingy
[13:45:05] <rmill> vitorr: ya
[13:45:06] <vitorr> hah ok
[13:45:24] <vitorr> rmill yeah I can figure that out.. but that's not really the issue here :(
[13:45:24] <rmill> just trying to demo how you can like, count XHR's, if you need to wait for more than one before doing a thing...
[13:45:30] <vitorr> yes
[13:45:53] <EnginA> ajpiano: i didn't know of this backbone thing
[13:46:11] <ajpiano> now you do
[13:47:46] <peterschmidler> Why is the window load function not executed here? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/hrlit
[13:49:36] <sk3pt1c> hello, can someone help me with a script?
[13:49:48] <rmill> ?ask @ sk3pt1c
[13:49:49] <bot-t> sk3pt1c, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:49:58] <ak> peterschmidler: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:50:39] <sk3pt1c> oh btw, any idea how i can reset my password if i've registered my nickname and can't remember it?
[13:51:02] <rmill> /msg nickserv help
[13:51:03] <b-ot> rmill, NO U!
[13:51:05] <peterschmidler> ak: Didn't find the answer to my question in there...
[13:51:33] <rmill> what's the question?
[13:51:40] <rmill> lol, welcome to #freenode
[13:51:50] <ak> peterschmidler: Description: Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element.
[13:53:01] <peterschmidler> ak: I assumed the $(window).load(function(){ ... } would be executed after all assets have been loaded.
[13:53:14] <ak> no
[13:53:23] <ak> load is loading stuff from the web...
[13:54:03] <johnkpaul> ak: there are two separate loads in jquery
[13:54:06] <johnkpaul> ak: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:54:07] <jita> Is there a plugin to append get query string to the url without actually reloading the page ?
[13:54:20] <sk3pt1c> rmill: i can't find a way to reset my password :/
[13:54:53] <ak> peterschmidler: is using the load function in the example i think
[13:55:05] <sk3pt1c> rmill: also, i have this script that calls a .remove() for a slideshow caption which kills my social media buttons for the next slides
[13:55:06] <ajpiano> sk3pt1c: /msg nickserv help or ask in #freenode , this is #jquery :)
[13:55:26] <sk3pt1c> rmill: what alternative to .remove() do i have?
[13:56:46] <ak> or maybe i'm just wrong
[14:00:07] <sk3pt1c> so, can anyone help with my script problem?
[14:00:31] <ajpiano> sk3pt1c: you don't need an "alternative to remove" you have to understand what's going on
[14:00:52] <ajpiano> are your social media button's actions attached with jQuery? are those elements being removed at some point?
[14:02:08] <EnginA> ajpiano: haha, today, i was thinking of building such a framework, but what I had in mind was a strongly-typed model, so that views would CRUD views would be automatically generated
[14:02:22] <EnginA> I'M just not that ahead in the docs and backbone also does something like that.
[14:02:45] <ajpiano> by default it maps CRUD on models to REST params
[14:03:18] <sk3pt1c> the buttons are inside the caption div, there's two a links for twitter and pinterest, twitter has a script i've pasted elsewhere in the code and pinterest a link to an external script, then there's facebook that has its little div and code pasted in the page elsewhere. what happens is that when the slideshow first loads, all three buttons show properly, but when you click on "next image" for example, only the pinterest one renders
[14:03:18] <sk3pt1c> properly, the twitter one shows just text and facebook disappears altogether
[14:03:19] <xckpd7> question: why does $.ajax automatically append this ?callback thing to the end of the url? is there anyway to turn that off?
[14:03:27] <EnginA> ajpiano: I'm talking about views though
[14:04:02] <EnginA> i.e. if you define a strongly typed model i.e. name:string, age:number, hair:color. youh can generate a form for each CRUD views.
[14:04:13] <EnginA> with a text field, numeric up down and a color picker
[14:04:26] <EnginA> nothing like that yet ?
[14:04:40] <ajpiano> not that i know of
[14:05:01] <EnginA> cool idea though, maybe i'll do it when i start a new projec
[14:05:44] <EnginA> you know there are many server side technologies for these shit
[14:05:44] <Solow> has anyone here ever worked with draggable/dropable in combination with a limited grid? So it's cross-list sortable, but I want to be able to say if the area is "full" or not
[14:05:57] <EnginA> but it never felt right to me... i think these stuff belongs to client side.
[14:06:09] <sk3pt1c> ajpiano: the script is galleriffic, you can see it here http://travel2italy.com/image/photography/js/jquery.galleriffic.js
[14:06:36] <ajpiano> sk3pt1c: this doesn't tell me anything about how those social media buttons work
[14:07:21] <sk3pt1c> ajpiano: how could i show you?
[14:07:40] <ajpiano> sk3pt1c: is "travel2italy.com" the site you're working on
[14:08:47] <sunbeam> how can i change in the jquery ui datepicker that it doesn't show like August 2012 but only August?
[14:09:39] <Solow> found it. never mind.
[14:09:52] <sk3pt1c> ajpiano: yes, the slider is here: http://travel2italy.com/Travel/Italy/Company/photography/index.html but the two buttons that are not working are not on that page
[14:10:26] <Solow> sunbeam: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-formats just give it month?
[14:11:02] <sk3pt1c> ajpiano: the twitter button/link is this: <a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://travel2italy.com/Travel/Italy/Company/photography/index.html#positano" data-text="Check out this beautiful photo of Positano, Italy" data-via="travelive"><span class="test">Tweet</span></a> and it works with a small piece of script i've pasted right before the closing body tag
[14:11:40] <sk3pt1c> ajpiano: actually, wait, i'll upload what i have on my mac now to another page so you can get a better look
[14:11:56] <ajpiano> sk3pt1c: sorry something just popped up at work
[14:12:33] <peterschmidler> The problem I described was fixed 2 days ago. Updated to query 1.8.1 and :) https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/901
[14:12:44] <Ziggy`> Is there any way, to make an array unique in the sense of "dramas" and "drama" being the same, and "documentary" and "documentaries" being the same?
[14:14:35] <sk3pt1c> ajpiano: ok, here it is, whenever you can take a look http://lithakia.gr/slidertest/index-social-tests.html
[14:14:43] <sk3pt1c> or anyone else for that matter, if you please :)
[14:15:17] <Deviad> Can anyone tell me if you can connect to this address: http://10.254.155.179/stefano/index.html ?
[14:15:33] <Deviad> I'm trying to get some feedback.
[14:15:44] <sk3pt1c> i can't
[14:16:30] <Deviad> I'm using XAMPP
[14:16:43] <nerk> xampp isn't the issue
[14:16:47] <nerk> port fowarding is
[14:16:58] <nerk> change access rules via your gateway/router
[14:17:13] <Deviad> I don't have any router, I have an UMTS connection
[14:17:23] <Deviad> probably I'm behind NAT then.
[14:17:27] <nerk> most isps disallow access to a residential connection via port 80
[14:17:42] <nerk> not sure then
[14:18:13] <Deviad> I disabled windows firewall as well...
[14:18:58] <Deviad> ok, try now one more time. if you can't connect it's a nat issue.
[14:19:15] <sk3pt1c> Deviad: still not
[14:21:34] <sk3pt1c> can anyone else help me with this? i need to get it working asap and i haven't found another slideshow that satisfies my boss :/
[14:22:02] <Deviad> OK, I got it... that one was my private ip address
[14:22:04] <Eviltwin> Sounds like poor planning
[14:22:25] <Deviad> Try with this one: http://151.71.250.81/stefano/index.html
[14:24:23] <sk3pt1c> still can't connect
[14:27:07] <Deviad> http://vincenzoampolo2.wordpress.com/2010/05/20/come-avere-un-ip-pubblico-con-qualsiasi-isp-fastweb-telecom-tiscali-ecc-ecc/
[14:27:21] <Deviad> I'm gonna set up ipv6
[14:28:59] <bigLanky>  can someone help me with some database calls?
[14:30:28] <Eviltwin> bigLanky: This is #jquery
[14:30:30] <Eviltwin> #jquery
[14:30:36] <Eviltwin> jQuery doesn't have database calls
[14:30:47] <bigLanky> oops sorry wrong chan
[14:30:50] <bigLanky> meant to past ethat in php
[14:46:48] <sk3pt1c> ajpiano: still there?
[14:54:03] <jita> Does anyone use history.js ?
[14:54:09] <jita> Can i use it with multiple get parameters ?
[14:54:16] <jita> without overwriting the existing ones
[14:54:29] <jita> the pushstate seems to overwrite my existing get parameters
[15:00:06] <sk3pt1c> i think i may have figured it out, if anyone can help, my pinterest link works and my twitter and facebook don't because they have data- values in them and .remove() kills their connections with the scripts… am i right in this?
[15:14:37] <adqm> hey all; i'm getting a strange error and wondering if anybody can help out
[15:14:51] <adqm> when i first load jquery into a page, i get the error "Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a){return a.nodeName.toLowerCase()} has no method 'toLowerCase'"
[15:14:51] <jita> what should i use to update query parameters ?
[15:16:27] <Deviad1> OK, finally I did it.
[15:16:49] <Deviad1> Can anyone pls try connecting to: http://[2002:9724:c9a2::9724:c9a2}/stefano/

[15:28:41] <sjeijk> hi all I'm trying to make some code that adds and removes columns here http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/wizard.html but somehow i could use some help because the way it work isn't what it should be
[15:30:04] <sjeijk> point is i need to give the columns unique id's so i thought i'll count the elements and add that number to the id name, but if I delete a row and add one, ill get the same ids
[15:30:51] <sjeijk> so i was thinking of making an array to store the unique id's in and get and remove them from that array, but my lack of skills draws me back
[15:31:30] <sjeijk> point is i have 2 pieces of code, 1 for adding, 1 for deleting, but this array is out of scope
[15:31:51] <sjeijk> should i make a plugin to get the array in scope for both fuctions?
[15:31:52] <sjeijk> ?
[15:49:12] <LittleFyr> if I have a string with a nodes ID what is better, $("#"+id ) or $(document.getElementById(id))
[16:09:31] <NackNick> i added my code to my site and it works fine in firefox but in chrome it doesnt work at all http://pastebin.com/JRZDgB5x
[16:09:38] <NackNick> any suggestions?
[16:11:17] <toothrot> NackNick, are you sure jquery is loaded at that point? why don't you look in the console..
[16:11:28] <ryanneufeld> NackNick: without looking at your code. Have you checked your console for errors?
[16:11:46] <NackNick> yeah theres no errors at all
[16:11:49] <NackNick> its strange
[16:11:56] <NackNick> and yes jquery is loaded
[16:12:15] <toothrot> how are you sure?
[16:12:18] <ryanneufeld> ?ready() @NackNick
[16:12:19] <bot-t> NackNick, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[16:12:24] <ryanneufeld> try that
[16:12:36] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna guess that you have your script tag in the header of the page
[16:12:43] <toothrot> that's actually what i meant, somehow
[16:12:48] <NackNick> actually the footer
[16:12:54] <toothrot> even though it isn't what i said
[16:13:07] <ryanneufeld> either way, try a document ready call
[16:13:14] <ryanneufeld> it's the Right Thing(tm)
[16:13:43] <NackNick> ok one moment
[16:19:27] <Salt> I'm having an issue with JSON parsing, the issue is accessing data via a variable. Specifically, I have followed the examples under .getJSON and the line "$.each(data.$frame, function(key, val) {" is where my issue is. $frame is a variable I've passed and relates to a JSON object, is there any way to set this?
[16:28:36] <sunbeam> how can i change in the jquery ui datepicker that it doesn't show like August 2012 but only August?
[16:32:56] <sjeijk> If I write $('.some-class').on('click', '.delete', function() { alert('stuff') }; and that class is 3 times on my page, then how can I prevent that the 3th element alerts 3 times hi??
[16:33:12] <sjeijk> stuff*
[16:36:34] <ColKurtz> sjeijk, that shouldn't be what happens, can you isolate your problem in a jsfiddle?
[16:36:40] <ColKurtz> I suspect it's an issue of event propagation
[16:36:56] <sjeijk> sure thanks gimme a sec
[16:37:13] <ColKurtz> are the elements children of each other? like
[16:37:30] <ColKurtz> <div class="someClass"><div class="someClass"><div class="someClass"></div></div></div>
[16:37:52] <ColKurtz> in that case, clicking the grand child would trigger your function 3 times
[16:38:15] <sjeijk> its live at http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/wizard.html
[16:38:26] <sjeijk> there is some really ugly jquery :s
[16:38:51] <sjeijk> I'm alerting ni btw to check what goes wring
[16:39:00] <sjeijk> wrong*
[16:39:20] <Salt> anyone have a good search query for data.variable, what the . would be called or some such?
[16:41:03] <rmurphey> Salt: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects
[16:42:10] <Salt> rmurphey: thank you, this looks helpful
[16:44:51] <Salt> excellent, just needed to use bracket notation, figured it was something simple
[16:44:56] <Salt> thanks
[16:47:15] <sjeijk> hmm in http://jsfiddle.net/cRwGB/ it works fine ColKurtz
[16:51:33] <ColKurtz> sjeijk, try running your site through the validator
[16:51:43] <ColKurtz> make sure all your tags are closed and well formed
[16:52:10] <ColKurtz> also, check if any children with the 'delete' class have a parent or ancestor also with the 'delete' class
[16:52:29] <sjeijk> which validator should i use :s
[16:52:34] <sjeijk> w3c?
[16:52:38] <ColKurtz> try calling event.stopPropagation(); (you have to pass event as an argument to your function, function(event){ /* ... */ });
[16:52:46] <ColKurtz> yeah the html5 validator
[16:52:48] <ColKurtz> assuming you're using html5
[16:52:52] <ColKurtz> which you should be
[16:59:30] <sjeijk> arch my jquery skills are so poor :(
[17:11:51] <sjeijk> i don't even get this to work
[17:11:52] <sjeijk> http://jsfiddle.net/cRwGB/2/
[17:16:33] <sjeijk> do you know why http://jsfiddle.net/cRwGB/4/ isn't working ColKurtz
[17:17:23] <ColKurtz> syntax error sj
[17:17:25] <ColKurtz> sjeijk,
[17:17:32] <ColKurtz> check your debug console
[17:17:40] <ColKurtz> it says Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[17:18:02] <coldhead> good work, ColKurtz!
[17:18:06] <ColKurtz> lol
[17:19:02] <sjeijk> :s
[17:27:11] <acidjazz> yo bitchez
[17:27:16] <acidjazz> so i got themes going
[17:27:19] <acidjazz> seperate css files
[17:27:27] <acidjazz> wondering if theres a way to swap them via js
[17:27:29] <acidjazz> w/out reloading the page
[17:29:34] <sjeijk> again works like it should in fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/cRwGB/6/ ColKurtz
[17:29:43] <arnpro> hey guys, can anyone give me a hand and tell me how could I "store" a javascript expression, and then process it when needed? for example: "parseFloat($("#txtResultadoExamen_559").val())/parseFloat($("#txtResultadoExamen_558").val())*100" the result should be something like "5 / 6 * 100", so then I can pass that to a Math Parser class... is that even possible? or im crazy?
[17:30:34] <ColKurtz> arnpro, either abstract it in a function that you can call multiple times
[17:30:52] <ColKurtz> or store the result in a var so you can use it multiple times
[17:30:54] <ColKurtz> the name of the game is DRY
[17:30:57] <ColKurtz> Don't Repeat Yourself
[17:31:48] <ColKurtz> welcome to discovering the need for abstraction/OOP :P
[17:31:58] <arnpro> ColKurtz: the UI is going to have a hundred textboxes, which the user can combine them, so for example he can pick first 2 and do a sum in the third checkbox, so that formula gets stored in db like, id3 = id1 / id2
[17:33:34] <arnpro> then PHP translates id's into $("#id_$1").val() so the formula gets stored in an Object array. When a blur event is fired in any textbox, it looks itself in the array, so if there is a formula for it, it processes it
[17:33:46] <arnpro> hahaha sounds crazy I know, but hope you understand ColKurtz
[17:33:53] <ColKurtz> ehh a little bit
[17:33:53] <ColKurtz> lol
[17:43:15] <dlam> is there a way to somehow print/log  the function names called when submitting some form?
[17:43:22] <imsky> no
[17:48:03] <Nirvana> what is the tool for inspecting css and html, very famous
[17:48:05] <Nirvana> i forgot
[17:48:24] <tw2113> firebug/inspector?
[17:48:28] <Nirvana> firebug yes
[17:48:37] <Nirvana> is theere firebug for ie out?
[17:48:41] <tw2113> no
[17:49:00] <tw2113> IE9 has their own attempt at an inspector too
[17:49:01] <tw2113> l
[17:49:07] <tw2113> hit F12
[17:49:28] <tw2113> you'll cry, but it sort of works
[17:52:32] <imsky> cry evrytim
[17:52:35] <Keu> You can use Firebug Lite in IE9. http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite
[18:15:51] <dlam> mmm is doing (function($) { ...       "bad"?    shouldnt it be like  $(document).ready(function() {
[18:16:50] <coldhead> they're not equivalent, dlam
[18:17:01] <coldhead> i almost always prefer the second form for readability and clarity
[18:18:51] <dlam> what's the difference?  both are used to just run-some-code
[18:18:58] <arnpro> there's also a $(function(){ }); isn't there? I don't know the difference
[18:19:00] <dlam> but the second is "safer" or something
[18:19:45] <rmurphey> $(fn) and $(document).ready(fn) are equivalent
[18:19:49] <tw2113> the more one drinks, the less coldhead feels new
[18:20:31] <rmurphey> (function($) { ... }(jQuery)) is an iife
[18:20:38] <rmurphey> ?g iife

[18:32:11] <defaultro> does jsfiddle support html 5?
[18:34:18] <tw2113> depends on what browser you're running
[18:34:25] <defaultro> ok
[18:34:57] <scriptThis> Is it not possible to refer to a radio button by ID, do you need to use the  name=foo convention?
[18:36:58] <tw2113> the site doesn't enable the features defaultro
[18:37:53] <defaultro> oh, thanks for taking a look at it
[18:38:08] <defaultro> i'll just upload my exercises to my server and use a newer browser
[18:39:25] <defaultro> html5's canvas is bringing me back to the 80s, Basic programming on my TRS-80 computer
[18:39:56] <rmurphey> defaultro: you can try out libraries like fabric
[18:40:27] <defaultro> will do in the future. I'm studying the basics right now :)
[18:40:50] <defaultro> awesome tutorial here, www.html5canvastutorials.com
[19:12:43] <lontrax> please, simple newbie question... what is the most recommended to be used?  http://pastebin.com/x3BMLF5e
[19:13:23] <stewbydoo> hey anybody familiar with raphael js lib?
[19:25:39] <tw2113> either lontrax
[19:25:55] <tw2113> i'd probably default to the first one so i don't have to keep typing jQuery
[19:26:45] <tw2113> both essentially do the same lontrax
[19:29:20] <lontrax> tw2113: thank you! ;)

[20:08:13] <IiIIiiIiiIiI> I'm using the follow code to detect orientation changes and apply styling to them for an iphone site (portrait and landscape). When I rotate the iphone it looks messy because I can see the styles changing. Would there be any way to hide all content until the orientation changes have taken place? http://jsfiddle.net/x4JRY/
[20:17:17] <punchystick> is there a reason $('#locationsContainer > .modal-body').load("../contacts/ajax/locations?q=" + $('#locationsSearchText').val()) cuts off the "?q=" part of the URL before sending it?!
[20:18:44] <publo> is there something wrong with my each statement attempt? jQuery('.notification').each(function(index) { alert('show'); showNotification(jQuery(this)); });
[20:21:17] <punchystick> publo: what exactly is that supposed to do?
[20:21:59] <publo> find every element with class .notification, and popup an alert + runa  function
[20:22:02] <publo> its not doing it
[20:22:09] <publo> first time i've used .each()
[20:22:23] <i_eat_salads> $.each($('.notification'), function(i, val) {
[20:22:45] <publo> why's my method wrong?
[20:22:54] <publo> i read it here: http://www.jquery4u.com/jquery-functions/jquery-each-examples/#.UDROZbMthDQ
[20:23:12] <tw2113> not passing in an index value?
[20:23:12] <i_eat_salads> well you didn't use $.each properly
[20:23:19] <publo> what did i do wrong
[20:23:30] <punchystick> omg what didn't you do wrong :P
[20:23:34] <publo> lol
[20:23:55] <tw2113> eh, not index
[20:24:01] <tw2113> the value to loop through
[20:24:15] <publo> i actually dont need index or value
[20:24:17] <publo> i just want the element
[20:24:28] <tw2113> and you're also not getting what you want :P
[20:24:32] <publo> lol
[20:24:36] <tw2113> so something in that statement is wrong
[20:25:01] <publo> hhmmm
[20:25:23] <tw2113> wouldn't the value passed in be everything from the  .notification selector?
[20:25:40] <publo> i think it would be everything inside the notification class element
[20:25:51] <publo> that link i just posted, i was trying to follow method #5
[20:27:16] <publo> jQuery('.notification').each(function() { alert('test'); });
[20:27:30] <publo> no luck there either
[20:27:47] <punchystick> publo: dude... go in your browser console and type this: $('.notification').each(function(i) { console.log(i, this })
[20:27:50] <defaultro> post the code in jsfiddle
[20:28:20] <punchystick> does that make sense?
[20:28:29] <tw2113> publo, http://jsbin.com/uyivap/1/edit
[20:28:31] <publo> yeah neither of those methods seemed to work in this scenario
[20:28:57] <publo> is it because im using "jQuery" as selector instead of "$" (because I have Prototype JS)
[20:29:25] <punchystick> publo: or this if you want to be a freaking weirdo: $('.notification').each(function(i) { alert(i, this })
[20:29:36] <publo> must be the selector title bro
[20:29:46] <punchystick> no I dont think so...
[20:29:56] <publo> hmm
[20:30:03] <punchystick> does it work in the console?
[20:30:14] <publo> il check
[20:30:20] <punchystick> also have you checked for other errors in the console?
[20:30:31] <publo> no errors in console, yes works in console: jQuery('.notification').each(function() { alert('test'); });
[20:30:35] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/uyivap/2/edit
[20:30:48] <punchystick> publo: then the problem is where you're running the code...
[20:30:50] <publo> this is my document.ready wrapper: (function() {
[20:30:55] <publo> have i got it wrong?
[20:31:02] <publo> too soon?
[20:31:08] <punchystick> publo: use a freaking pastie bin
[20:31:09] <tw2113> $(document).ready(function(){
[20:31:19] <publo> boom
[20:32:01] <publo> lol i was using google analytics function to determine document ready
[20:33:46] <publo> done working
[20:33:50] <publo> high 5
[20:35:40] <publo> is this the correct method of using timeout?
[20:35:40] <publo> setTimeout( hideNotification(this), 3000 )
[20:35:43] <publo> or does jquery have a better version
[20:36:57] <punchystick>       jQuery(this)
[20:36:59] <punchystick>         );
[20:37:01] <punchystick>     }
[20:37:03] <punchystick> whoops
[20:37:09] <punchystick> publo: http://api.jquery.com/delay/ ?
[20:37:18] <publo> yeap im there thanks
[20:37:20] <punchystick> also, lmgtfy.com
[20:37:37] <publo> if i define a function abc ( element)     does    jQuery("div").abc() pass the element to abc as a parameter?
[20:37:49] <publo> as if i called abc(jQuery('div")) ?
[20:39:19] <punchystick> huh?
[20:39:40] <punchystick> define your functions in your own freaking namespace
[20:40:12] <publo> trying this: jQuery.delay( 1000, function(){ alert('1'); hideNotification(el) });
[20:41:54] <punchystick> publo: $('#foo').slideUp(300).delay(800).fadeIn(400);
[20:42:01] <punchystick> publo: The .delay() method is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects. Because it is limited—it doesn't, for example, offer a way to cancel the delay—.delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases.
[20:42:06] <publo> oh okay
[20:42:07] <punchystick> publo: http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[20:42:12] <punchystick> publo: rtfm
[20:42:26] <jamesaa> any idea why this isn't working http://codepad.viper-7.com/MIsfzk I'm new to jquery
[20:44:43] <publo> delay blocks other actions on the same element?
[20:46:52] <tw2113> so you want to hide all h2 a's on hover?
[20:47:06] <tw2113> and just show its title attr instead?
[20:48:14] <tw2113> TypeError: $("h2 a").attr("title").show is not a function
[20:48:24] <tw2113> TypeError: $("h2 a").attr("href").hide is not a function
[20:48:44] <punchystick> jamesaa: wtf is this supposed to do?!
[20:49:35] <jamesaa> punchystick, I want it to display the link's title element on hover I just realized I selected the href but don't know how to select the text inside <a></a>
[20:49:45] <jamesaa> punchystick, I mean href
[20:50:10] <tw2113> the title element should show on hover by nature
[20:50:21] <punchystick> to change an attr you $().attr(attrName, value)
[20:50:33] <punchystick> ...
[20:50:35] <punchystick> um
[20:51:32] <jamesaa> punchystick, I wasn't thinking before this is what I've got but it's not doing what I want http://jsfiddle.net/zrapm/
[20:51:55] <tw2113> the title already shows on hover
[20:52:04] <tw2113> that's the purpose of that attribute
[20:52:10] <jamesaa> tw2113, replace what's inside <a>
[20:52:16] <jamesaa> </a>
[20:52:20] <tw2113> just make it the same
[20:52:33] <tw2113> unless you somehow can't control that
[20:52:54] <tw2113> the href in your example would be example.html
[20:52:56] <punchystick> jamesaa: you mean $("<a href='index.html'>text inside</a>").text()
[20:53:14] <jamesaa> punchystick, yeah
[20:53:23] <punchystick> jamesaa: or
[20:53:25] <punchystick> jamesaa: $("<a href='index.html'>text inside</a>").text("changed")
[20:53:38] <jamesaa> punchystick, the second
[20:53:49] <punchystick> jamesaa: so whats the problem?
[20:53:59] <tw2113> he's trying to use index.html
[20:54:13] <jamesaa> punchystick, I want it to replace text inside with the href
[20:54:43] <tw2113> so you want to make it <a href="index.html">index.html</a> ?
[20:56:15] <punchystick> jamesaa: you're not doing it even remotely correct
[20:56:16] <jamesaa> tw2113, on hover yes and then off hover back to normal
[20:56:21] <punchystick> jamesaa: heh.. hod on i'll fiddle it for you
[20:56:33] <jamesaa> punchystick, I'm sorry I'm new to jquery :D
[20:56:47] <punchystick> jamesaa: and javascript?  :P
[20:56:53] <jamesaa> punchystick, yeah
[20:58:26] <punchystick> jamesaa: do you know how to use your browsers debug console to see the javascript errors?
[20:58:31] <punchystick> thats your first problem...
[20:58:39] <jamesaa> punchystick, yeah
[21:01:54] <punchystick> jamesaa: http://jsfiddle.net/tLMXp/
[21:02:15] <jamesaa> punchystick, thanks
[21:02:16] <punchystick> jamesaa: notice I just jammed the old text into this.temp
[21:02:26] <punchystick> jamesaa: this.temp = $(this).text()
[21:02:44] <jamesaa> punchystick, ok
[21:02:49] <punchystick> jamesaa: there might be a better place to save it depending on the app
[21:03:36] <punchystick> jamesaa: you understand what "this" means in javascript?
[21:03:46] <jamesaa> punchystick, yeah
[21:03:50] <jamesaa> punchystick, mostly
[21:04:06] <punchystick> jamesaa: do some testing by opening the conosle and typing stuff like this in : $("h2 a").hover( console.log(this) )
[21:04:20] <jamesaa> punchystick, sure
[21:04:29] <punchystick> or whatever... until you figure out wtf is going on...
[21:04:40] <tw2113> console ftw
[21:05:10] <punchystick> jamesaa: but I just jammed that this.temp variable in there because in javascript everything is an object... so you can basically stick stuff anywhere...
[21:05:44] <punchystick> (function() { alert("blah") }).tempVar = "blah"
[21:05:48] <punchystick> or stupid shit like that
[21:11:20] <jamesaa> punchystick, ok thanks
[21:12:24] <punchystick> jamesaa: no problem man :)
[21:23:11] <publo> punch when I add a click event on an element to hide it, and also add a delay 5 seconds to hide it automatically, the click event doesnt work anymore
[21:23:16] <publo> is this by design?
[21:24:16] <publo> it's as though the animation queue is already blocked by the delay item
[21:26:49] <publo> gotit workign using SetTimeout
[21:32:17] <tash> trying to convert my DataTables table to server-side pagination, etc. I'm getting this error now, and am just hoping that someone in here has had a similar issue: DataTables warning (table id = 'search-results-table'): Requested unknown parameter '7' from the data source for row 0
[21:47:05] <mfoxdogg|work> hey all, what event is fired when an element is removed from a div using .remove?
[22:14:18] <rufianw> I need to change the html code of an object, and it to get resized slowly until reaching the new size (like when using .show() and .hide())
[22:14:24] <rufianw> Any tips?
[22:15:07] <Cognitive> Hi everyone. an argument of jQuery.ajax({ <other stuff> success: function(result){data=result;}}) why not just immediately assign result to success?
[22:15:13] <Cork> rufianw: you mean an embeded element?
[22:15:28] <Cork> Cognitive: like flash or java or something like that?
[22:15:31] <Cork> opps sorry
[22:15:34] <Cork> rufianw: ^
[22:15:36] <rufianw> uhm... I don't know what you mean.
[22:15:43] <rufianw> It's a <td> of a table.
[22:15:51] <Cork> rufianw: then don't say object :)
[22:15:57] <rufianw> At some time, it data gets changed.
[22:16:19] <rufianw> And I need it to resize slowly in order to not get the user confused.
[22:16:36] <Cork> td is tricky, they have rules that make then adjust to a lot of other rules then css
[22:16:38] <rufianw> *its data gets changed
[22:16:43] <Cork> that makes them hard to control
[22:17:06] <Cork> what you can do is put the text inside the td in a span or div with overflow: hidden
[22:17:17] <Cork> set the size you want and animate it up to the size you want it to have
[22:17:24] <rufianw> Oh...
[22:18:19] <rufianw> The bad thing would be elements would not be shown until the animation ends, is it?
[22:18:42] <Cork> not necessary
[22:18:47] <Cork> it depends on how you do it
[22:20:09] <rufianw> Doesn't jquery have something to, at the same time, hide something and show another thing?
[22:25:23] <matteu> rufianw: if you sequentially add lines of animation to a script that begin immediately, jQuery will begin the animations sequentially but the animation will occur in parallel
[22:26:40] <rufianw> matteu: yeah, I'm thinking in putting two divs. Moving all the old content to one, and put the new one in the other, which would be hidden. Then, use .hide(...) and .show(...) to perform the animation.
[22:27:44] <matteu> rufianw: "jQuery(first-div).hide(); jQuery(second-div).show(); should work for you then
[22:29:59] <dbe> Anyone seen a simple $.get spam a ton of requests over and over?
[22:30:13] <rufianw> matteu: Ok, now the problems are 1. how to create the divs and smoothly move the content to them. 2. That works well for a generic container. Sad it had to be a tr. I don't know of any container who can be put in the middle of a tr and a td.
[22:30:24] <dbe> I essentially have $.get('http://localhost:3000/home/gamio', function(){console.log('hi')});
[22:30:34] <dbe> And as soon as the server returns, it sends another request
[22:30:43] <DarkGhost`> I see in some code, it has $randomvarname = jquery
[22:30:45] <DarkGhost`> how does that work?
[22:31:43] <tw2113> my first guess is something similar to how you can just use $
[22:32:03] <tw2113> they want to use $randomvarname('#id')
[22:32:09] <tw2113> but i can definitely be wrong
[22:32:29] <matteu> rufianw: 1. for creating divs, see jQuery docs on manipulation, http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[22:32:50] <matteu> rufianw: 2.  you can put anything you want in a td, but most browsers won't render anything after a tr except th or td
[22:33:27] <DarkGhost`> hmm makes sense tw2113, but how do they set randomvarname?
[22:34:07] <tw2113> by assigning jquery to it
[22:34:12] <tw2113> that is the assigning
[22:34:15] <crankharder> erm, i'm seeing results that make $.each seem like it's asynchronous.  that is, the method immeaditely after $.each(){} is being executed before the markup generated by the each block is finished... how's that possible?
[22:35:00] <Cork> crankharder: nope each is a for loop
[22:35:10] <Cork> its synchronous
[22:35:10] <tw2113> it's the Cork
[22:35:15] <grantg> hey hey hey
[22:35:21] <tw2113> oh shit, it's grantg too
[22:35:23] <crankharder> nevermind, 130am == full retard
[22:35:30] <grantg> lol
[22:35:36] <grantg> and you too
[22:35:58] <grantg> tw2113: Did you see that Google's new benchmark includes my gb emulator?
[22:36:06] <Cork> lol
[22:36:10] <grantg> really
[22:36:23] <tw2113> i hadn't
[22:36:23] <Cork> grantg: man your site is really getting around now days :)
[22:36:33] <tw2113> but i confess to not paying too close attention to google stuff
[22:36:49] <grantg> http://code.google.com/p/octane-benchmark/source/browse/trunk/gbemu.js
[22:37:01] <grantg> Cork: I took the gb pages off my server though
[22:37:12] <Cork> to high a load huh?
[22:37:14] <Cork> :)
[22:37:19] <grantg> Don't want trouble because it's too popular
[22:38:52] <tw2113> i think the zencoding implementation for sublime text on mac is better than the one on linux
[22:39:46] <tw2113> eh, maybe not in this example
[22:40:15] <tw2113> i keep forgetting that syntax highlighting is important for what tab does
