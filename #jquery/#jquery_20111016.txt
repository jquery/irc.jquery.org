[00:45:16] <dexter_e> do error events bubble ?
[01:02:07] <Spadeski> How would I get the data responded from this 	$(".edit_inline").editable("Modules/Module_Change_User_Info.php", { saving:"<img src='img/indicator.gif'>", extraParams:{id:42} });
[01:03:40] <dexter_e> plugin?
[01:03:50] <Spadeski> dexter yeah
[01:04:11] <Spadeski> dexter_e:  http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/tag/editinplace/
[01:06:13] <dexter_e> have tried  .html()  on the target of whats being edited?
[01:06:43] <dexter_e> after editing
[01:07:35] <Spadeski> dexter_e:  uhh no fairly new too how plugins work
[01:08:24] <dexter_e> if it does what it says perhaps the html() of the edit target will just return the finished result.
[01:09:28] <Spadeski> Well what is it returning though is the question
[01:10:00] <dexter_e> most likely an html string
[01:10:28] <Spadeski> or dexter_e i dont think thats the prob I think my input isnt returning anything to the php
[01:28:07] <Spadeski> dexter_e:  Would you please help me
[02:15:28] <asadpakistani> I know attribute selectors do not work in css with some versions of IE...do they work in all versions of IE with jquery?

[02:42:18] <loong> Hi, is it possible to do long polling with jquery?
[02:42:28] <loong> !long polling
[02:52:58] <fat_Mike> hello, I can't get my fadein to work onload http://jsfiddle.net/J3cDZ/2/
[03:04:20] <AlexC_> g'morning
[03:04:31] <ravenzz> morning
[03:05:05] <AlexC_> I am trying to use jQuery UI Sortable with nested ol/li elements however it seems this isn't possible as it will only let me drag/drop the 'parent' li. Am I missing something?
[03:06:47] <ravenzz> AlexC_ http://mjsarfatti.com/sandbox/nestedSortable/
[03:07:20] <AlexC_> ravenzz: thanks, I saw this earlier so I guess I'll go with this as well. Are there any plans to make this possible with just jQuery UI?
[03:07:36] <ravenzz> I dunno
[03:07:54] <ravenzz> I just googled that
[03:08:03] <ravenzz> maybe there is a "native" solution
[03:10:31] <AlexC_> oh wait it seems to be working now; however I can't alter the parent of the 'li's ... which isn't /too/ bad
[03:13:42] <AlexC_> awesome, 'connectWidth' does it :)
[03:17:17] <ravenzz> AlexC_ http://jsfiddle.net/HBz5X/
[03:18:00] <ravenzz> it works like a charm
[03:18:27] <AlexC_> ravenzz: not entirely; you need 'connectWith' so you can move parent
[03:18:31] <inad922> hello
[03:18:50] <ravenzz> AlexC_ you can move the parent in my fiddle
[03:19:36] <inad922> Is there a way to get the size of an image using javascript or I just need to get the width of the img tag containing it?
[03:19:37] <AlexC_> ravenzz: try and move 'Item 4' child which is currently under 'Item 2' to 'Item 7'
[03:20:11] <Shisma> hi
[03:20:11] <inad922> I would like to make an image slider and with images of same height but different width so I somehow need to know the width
[03:20:21] <AlexC_> actually even this doesn't do entirely what I need ... I'll have to use nestedSortable
[03:20:27] <Shisma> is it possible to encode json in javascript or jquery?
[03:21:06] <ravenzz> AlexC_ buh It works for me
[03:21:21] <Shisma> something like var string = makeItJSON({foo:'bar'});
[03:21:34] <Shisma> i only found parse functions
[03:21:34] <AlexC_> ravenzz: no it doesn't
[03:22:32] <ravenzz> i was able to move the Item 4 and place it after the 7
[03:23:13] <AlexC_> ravenzz: 7 of which 'ul' though :)
[03:23:29] <ravenzz> Would you move the Item 4 to another parent?
[03:23:41] <AlexC_> yes that's what I'm talking about
[03:23:45] <ravenzz> oh
[03:23:50] <ravenzz> I see
[03:25:57] <AlexC_> nestedSortable to the rescue it seems then
[03:27:31] <whezz> hello .. i really need some help concerning draggables and nested sortables (not the plugin). The draggable should be droppale to the inner and outer sortable. But when i specify both sortables (the inner and outer one) in the connectToSortable selector, only the first one in the list will accect the draggable. When i give both sortables the same class and use the class as selector in the
[03:27:31] <whezz> connectToSortable statement, then the dragged item will be added to both lists at once (will be duplicated) ...
[03:38:21] <whezz> hm
[03:39:54] <loong> Hi, is it possible to do long polling with jquery?
[03:44:38] <fat_Mike> How may I call this  <div class="box green"></div> in jquery
[03:46:58] <AlexC_> fat_Mike: call? Do you mean select it?
[03:47:08] <fat_Mike> correct
[03:47:24] <AlexC_> fat_Mike: div.box.green
[03:47:36] <fat_Mike> thankx alexc
[04:23:28] <cakiiooo> jsfidle.net/GNc3c/2.    Why wont it add the highlight class to the previous item?
[04:23:51] <cakiiooo> http://jsfiddle.net/GNc3c/2
[04:28:09] <cakiiooo> Wow, i always fuck up on the easy probs, .prev should be .parent
[04:52:05] <alessioalex> any backbone.js channel around here?
[05:11:41] <whezz> I'm pretty new to jQuery and I need some help. I have a few draggable elements and a sortable list that accepts these draggables (via the connectToSortable-option). One of the draggable is a new <ul>, so when I drop this one into the sortable i have a nested sortable. Ok, works. Now both sortables (the inner and the outer one) should accept the draggable elements. And they both do accept the
[05:11:41] <whezz> draggables, but, when I drop one onto the inner sortable, the element will be added to the inner AND outer sortable. And it must not do this ... I set greedy to true for the inner sortable but it didn't solve the problem.

[05:49:55] <ReAn> anyone know of a good example of this?

[06:07:12] <Iszak> so if there is greater than one img it may be faulting.
[06:27:59] <especially-corn> hello, i just found jquery and i thought i'd rewrite parts of my website with it, if i have like a guestbook page
[06:28:57] <especially-corn> i am currently giving them the option of editing their post and right now if they click edit that takes them to another page with a text box in it where they can edit the post
[06:29:07] <especially-corn> and i'm thinking of creating a modal jquery form
[06:30:57] <especially-corn> is there any way to do that other than <div class="display"><p>their post</p></div><div class="div-align-right"><div class="jquery-dialog"><p>their post</p></div></div>
[06:31:03] <ReAn> erichynds, thanks for the link, it helped a LOT
[06:31:08] <erichynds> np
[06:32:21] <ReAn> was a little apprehensive about requiring jquery-ui for my plugin, but all i really need is widget, so if people dont want jqui then they can get the 9k custom with just core/widget :D

[06:58:30] <hardet> I'm building a website where the entire navigation is controlled by ajax, so essentially one div called "content" shows the subsites. Each subsite can have some javascripts, which i get by using $.getScript(), but when the user leaves the subsite i would like to remove that javascript again, is that possible?
[07:09:50] <spal> $.each(links, function (i, link) { $.ajax({url: link, success: func}) }); gunc(). In this case it is possible for gunc() to execute before func(). Am I right?
[07:09:53] <DrPoole> good morning.
[07:11:09] <DrPoole> Hm.  i realize this is more a javascript question than jQuery.  Hope that's alright.  I'm doing var foo = setInterval("foo()", 2000); and my function foo() return '123'; but when I alert var foo it always comes back '2' which I assume is some sort of response type.
[07:11:54] <especially-corn> how can i send server requests with jquery?
[07:12:01] <DrPoole> .ajax
[07:12:15] <DrPoole> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:12:48] <especially-corn> thanks
[07:18:04] <especially-corn> how can i make a dynamic jquery dialog? like a button to perform a different action on given parameters?
[07:18:06] <spal> DrPoole, yes, so what's the issue with that?
[07:19:36] <spal> DrPoole, that's the id value returned to you. You can use that value with clearInterval() to undo setInterval().
[07:21:11] <DrPoole> ah, thanks
[07:22:31] <spal> any help with my question: $.each(links, function (i, link) { $.ajax({url: link, success: func}) }); gunc(). In this is it possible that gunc() executes before func()?
[07:23:59] <especially-corn> can i load a js file with parameters ?
[07:25:57] <dabear> spal: for the SECOND TIME:: NO
[07:26:34] <dabear> spal: eh, well yes
[07:26:35] <dabear> :p
[07:26:58] <dabear> the each will complete before gunc is run
[07:27:21] <dabear> the ajax success callback will most likely happen after
[07:29:32] <Vespakoen_> Hey guys, i am trying to select an input that is in an array structure: <input name="cart[qty]" ?> how can i select that item by jquery by its name?
[07:29:54] <Vespakoen_> $('input[name=cart[qty]]').val(); didn't work
[07:34:39] <Vespakoen_> no one ?
[07:35:22] <JackBauer24> add \ before squared bracket
[07:35:39] <JackBauer24> $('input[name=cart\[qty\]]').val();
[07:37:39] <Vespakoen_> great! thanks! JackBauer24
[07:39:22] <Vespakoen_> uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=cart[qty]]
[07:42:33] <Vespakoen_> 'input[name="cart\[qty\]"]' did the trick!
[07:45:00] <inad922> there is a scroll function in jquery like .scroll(handler(eventObject)). How can I get if the user scrolled up or down?
[07:46:33] <dexter_e> JackBauer24:  what does that do actually.. escaping the brackets and passing to jQuery like that.. just curious
[07:50:04] <Zxurian> so i've got an idea, but I don't know how to go about implementing it. I have a page that loads, and a large background image that gets loaded behind it via ajax so it doesn't slow down the initial page load. What i'd like to do, is if the background image is already cached by the browser, display the image at the same time the page loads, if not, then load it via ajax, and fade it in once done loading. Is this even possible?
[07:51:24] <JackBauer24> dexter_e: it seems to work even without escaping brackets, but I remember that in previous version I couldn't do such thing without escaping. Maybe it's fixed now
[07:52:17] <Zxurian> currently, I can't seem to find a reliable way to try and detect if the ajax request is coming from the browsers cache or not
[08:05:46] <dexter_e> Zxurian: Its possible , I've seen it.  Are you sure you need to know its coming from the cache ?  Its really just a matter of how long its delayed when loading right?

[10:16:56] <EducaSoft> Hi, I am learning to use jquery (works allready pretty fine) and am now looking to give the user a good experience.
[10:17:01] <alessioalex> I'm not sure how to achieve this
[10:17:18] <EducaSoft> is there a way to preload images and then later on inject them into the DOM with jquery ?
[10:17:47] <EducaSoft> so they are NOT in my html file, I want to inject them after they are loaded and I want to inject into the DOM
[10:24:09] <EducaSoft> is there anybody who coud help me a little with my problem ?
[10:24:13] <EducaSoft> please
[10:26:32] <Patatouf> hi ! I have a question about query : when my document is ready i use a function $('.myclass').click function that add some dom  of class "myclass" that should be affect by the previous function. But as it has been added after the page has been loaded it is not the case. Any solution ?
[10:30:11] <EducaSoft> could somebody please just tell me if its possible somehow to have jquery load an image from an url and then inject it into the DOM ?
[10:30:58] <fiveshotdon> image preloading
[10:31:41] <EducaSoft> wel just have a img object which is loaded by jquery and only when its finished loading I want to insert it into the dom

[10:32:51] <GeO`> hey guys
[10:33:12] <fiveshotdon> hey
[10:33:14] <GeO`> I want to achieve something like jquery ui sortable, but just the two elements in question are swapped
[10:33:25] <GeO`> is it possible?
[10:34:19] <fiveshotdon> disabled: true
[10:34:46] <GeO`> ahem
[10:36:44] <fiveshotdon> maybe use items: 'canbesortedclass'
[10:37:44] <GeO`> that just specifies which items are to be sorted
[10:38:04] <GeO`> but does not change the sorting method
[10:39:43] <fiveshotdon> so you give the two elements you need to be sortable a class
[10:41:24] <DualDetroit> Yo yo yo, the Dual Doctors be in da house breakin' it down to lisp lambdas.
[10:41:45] <DualDetroit> So, what does query refer to in jquery?
[10:42:20] <fiveshotdon> querying the DOM
[10:43:08] <DualDetroit> Oh my god, that is brilliant
[10:43:17] <DualDetroit> Very clever.
[10:43:47] <GeO`> fiveshotdon : oh OK I get it, but there's actually more than 2 elements in my list
[10:44:22] <fiveshotdon> thats ok, you would just give say element 1 and element 2 a class such as sortme
[10:45:16] <fiveshotdon> then pass items: ".sortme",
[10:47:01] <GeO`> but how do I do that on the fly while element1 is dragged onto element2 ?
[10:49:58] <fiveshotdon> so you want only elements 1 to swap with element 6 for example?
[10:50:09] <GeO`> actually I want exactly that : http://www.eslinstructor.net/demo/swappable/swappable_list.html
[10:50:37] <fiveshotdon> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Swapable
[10:50:45] <GeO`> but this plugin doesn't support animations for example, so I was looking for something more academic
[10:50:48] <GeO`> yes that is

[10:53:57] <ryrych> a few days ago I relased rlightbox 1.1 â€“ a jQuery UI lightbox. Give it a whirl! ;) http://ryrych.github.com/rlightbox2
[10:55:19] <fiveshotdon> you would need to get the elements original position then have a callback function that gets the next element then move it to the original pos
[10:57:09] <DualDetroit> Now that Apple is careening out of control, General Motors can confidently resume its position as Largest Company In The World.

[11:00:07] <DualDetroit> "We build your cars, and soon we will also build your web services."
[11:00:28] <Dodfr> I would like to reset some form fields according to an attached class, I could use a class selector but as fields may be of different types (text, checbox, select...) a simple .val("") is not enought, what is the simplest way to reset any type of field ?
[11:04:04] <fiveshotdon> $(".myFieldsClass").val(' ').removeAttr('checked').removedAttr('selected')
[11:04:24] <fiveshotdon> $(".myFieldsClass").val('').removeAttr('checked').removeAttr('selected')
[11:04:33] <ServerCrash> $.ajax({ url: "http://localhost/foo.php" give status 200 with no data where as same url:foo.php gets all the needfull data
[11:04:54] <ServerCrash> any idea if url field can have this http:// in it?
[11:04:54] <Ring0`> Hi. http://pastebin.com/iEtCpnAY Always works only first div, when I change the order as well, only first.
[11:04:58] <Ring0`> Thanks in advance.
[11:05:36] <fiveshotdon> use a class instead
[11:05:40] <fiveshotdon> id should be unique
[11:06:00] <Ring0`> fiveshotdon: ok I will try !
[11:06:37] <Ring0`> fiveshotdon: Worked like a charm. Thanks!
[11:06:56] <fiveshotdon> no prob
[11:07:13] <ServerCrash> $.ajax({ url: "http://localhost/foo.php" give status 200 with no data where as same url: "foo.php"  gets all the needfull data
[11:07:29] <ServerCrash> do we need to configure something for domain/cross domain
[11:08:07] <Dodfr> fiveshotdon: yes I already attached decidated class to each group of form fields that need to be reset
[11:08:50] <fiveshotdon> yer so use $(".yourclass").val(' ').removeAttr('checked').removedAttr('selected')
[11:12:27] <Dodfr> fiveshotdon: ok doing multiple .xxx .xxx do the trick ? I thought about it but I thought it might generate an error of for example if tying a removeAttr('selected') on field that has no selected attribute.

[11:55:31] <lduros> hello, does anybody know of a JS library that will parse an HTML DOM from a string (which could be HTML tag soup), allows for some DOM manipulation on the parsed DOM, and then to output it again as a string?
[11:55:51] <lduros> and of course i'd need it to be free/open-source :-)
[11:56:13] <DThought> lduros: should it run in a browser?
[11:57:12] <DThought> if so, you could simply create a document, fill it from the string, and use the normal dom operations on it afterwards?
[11:57:38] <lduros> DThought: not necessarily in a browser
[11:58:05] <lduros> DThought: Actually I'd like to use that before the browser parses anything
[11:58:11] <lduros> DThought: in an add-on
[11:59:41] <fiveshotdon> server side you could use BeautifulSoup depending on what you are looking to do
[12:00:46] <lduros> fiveshotdon: can't use server side, because I want to use it in an add-on that's standalone :-)
[12:01:33] <fiveshotdon> http://ejohn.org/blog/pure-javascript-html-parser/
[12:01:51] <lduros> fiveshotdon: yeh found that one, but it doesn't do HTML5
[12:02:02] <lduros> (I also contemplated porting the HTML 5 parser, wholesale, but that seemed like a herculean effort.)
[12:02:27] <lduros> maybe I'll just use regular expressions then
[12:03:10] <lduros> or just make a small tokenizer for my purpose only

I want to acquire a lock before updating this variable so that multiple ajax requests completing at almost the same time don't interleave and leave this variable in a  bad state.
[12:19:43] <spal> Is there a way?
[12:20:18] <ch3mi0n> No
[12:20:22] <ch3mi0n> Don't update the same variable
[12:21:04] <ch3mi0n> This is called a race condition. The only way to solve a race condition is to not create them.
[12:21:22] <Eviltwin> spal: JavaScript is executed serially, not in parallel
[12:21:31] <Eviltwin> Only one function is in progress at any given time
[12:22:07] <Eviltwin> There's no need for locking because no two things can be running at the same time
[12:22:10] <ch3mi0n> Eviltwin: but he has no way of knowing which one got executed first by the callback
[12:22:18] <ch3mi0n> Hence race condition
[12:22:38] <spal> ch3mi0n, for the particular problem, I am only inserting data into a list and the order doesn't matter. so I guess it should be fine.
[12:22:45] <Eviltwin> It is fine
[12:53:33] <gabbah> hi, I'm using the jQuery plugin jCarousel. The problem I have is that I trigger scrolls to items in the carousel BEFORE the animation is done. This means the call to carousel.scroll() when an animation is in progress is simply ignored. Is there a way to cancel the ongoing animation using jQuery, and simply let it start a new animation?
[13:02:51] <gabbah> aha, I think I managed it: $('ul').stop(false, true); // stop ongoing animation
[13:03:00] <gabbah> before i call carousel.scroll()
[13:22:49] <diverdude> Is there any reason to not just always just $.live() to bind events?
[13:26:39] <oojacoboo> how can I set an .ajax script to fail gracefully?
[13:26:58] <oojacoboo> success: do whatever, error: ??
[13:27:20] <oojacoboo> break; ?
[13:50:26] <Conti> can anyone suggest a workaround that actually works to provide this.focus() this.select() functionality on iOS devices?
[13:50:39] <Conti> focus() works but select() does notâ€¦
[13:53:58] <Conti> I have tried about a half dozen variations
[13:54:17] <Iarfen> Hi
[13:54:33] <Iarfen> How I can change the url in javascript withouth refreshing the page??
[13:54:42] <Conti> document.location
[13:54:57] <Iarfen> Conti: if I use document.location I refresh the page
[13:56:23] <Conti> larfen: bind it to a hash change function
[13:56:47] <diverdude> How do i hide the jquery ui div box?
[13:56:51] <Conti> look up window.onhashchange
[13:57:26] <Iarfen> Conti: ok ty
[13:59:28] <diverdude> conti can you help me
[14:01:07] <Conti> I don't use jquery ui
[14:01:08] <Conti> sorry
[14:03:10] <Conti> but as to my unanswered question - does anyone in here happen to know how to get a jquery select() function to select text in an input box on iOS - mobile safari appears to not support select() at all - I've used over a half dozen different methods now that work on all other webkit based browsers with no luck
[14:25:55] <HI_bankzy> I'm looking for a good source to follow to create a infinite image slide loop. I've got the sliding process done, just need the part where it takes the front image and appends it to the end
[14:26:05] <HI_bankzy> If anyone knows of one, could they please share the link :D
[14:33:25] <wookiehangover> HI_bankzy: are you making it yourself?
[14:33:30] <wookiehangover> or using a plugin
[14:33:54] <HI_bankzy> Making it myself
[14:34:22] <wookiehangover> cool
[14:34:25] <wookiehangover> https://github.com/quickleft/ql_gallery/blob/master/src/jquery.ql_gallery.js
[14:34:34] <wookiehangover> so if you keep track of the slide index
[14:35:11] <wookiehangover> you can do something like $slides.eq(index).clone().appendTo( $slides.parent() )
[14:35:35] <wookiehangover> and index - 1 for when you're moving backwards
[14:35:59] <fiveshotdon>   http://cssglobe.com/post/4004/easy-slider-15-the-easiest-jquery-plugin-for-sliding
[14:36:14] <wookiehangover> and just do those two operations when you initialize the plugin, so you start with 1 extra slide at the beginning and end of your slideshow
[14:36:15] <gabbah> i think jCarousel could do what you want
[14:36:25] <HI_bankzy> Problem im hitting is that i have 3 images displaying at once, and when you go next it moves them all over one space and a new image loads on the right
[14:36:59] <gabbah> jCarousel lets you load via ajax
[14:37:03] <wookiehangover> then to calculate the index you'd just need to divide your total number of images by3
[14:37:25] <wookiehangover> there are a ton of plugins that do this
[14:37:34] <wookiehangover> but I encourage you to do it yourself

[16:15:02] <quizme> in my response handler to $.ajax I try to save the response object  by saying "that.resp = data"  ?. the data (an object) is there but then when i query it later in my getter method, it's undefined. ?.. where did it go ?  Was it garbage collected ?
[16:20:36] <quizme> http://pastie.org/2708526  <--- i'm using the revealed module method
[16:22:17] <Dave_Stein> quizme: was there a question?

[16:26:09] <coldhead> seconds before you joined
[16:26:13] <Dave_Stein> coldhead: thanks
[16:26:32] <coldhead> quizme: it's not being garbage collected
[16:26:41] <coldhead> GC only removes data to which there is no reference
[16:26:49] <Dave_Stein> its funny because it went to the 16th by default, but i think its the 17th in GMT
[16:26:58] <coldhead> and you have a refernce
[16:27:04] <coldhead> it wouldn't dare touch it
[16:27:26] <coldhead> are you sure that the data has been returned when you go to access it?
[16:27:47] <coldhead> you're down with how the A in AJAX is for ASYNCH, right?
[16:28:04] <coldhead> Dave_Stein: that log is using some weird indian timezone
[16:28:08] <quizme> sorry
[16:28:12] <quizme> it was just a timing issue

[16:28:57] <nathanw> hey can someone help me IE debug ? I don't know enough about JS to do it :(
[16:29:38] <coldhead> nathanw: the best bet for IE debugging is often to run your code through jshint
[16:29:44] <coldhead> ?g jshint
[16:29:45] <bot-t1> coldhead, JSHint, A JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://jshint.com/
[16:29:57] <nathanw> oh thanks !
[16:30:08] <nathanw> i ran it through jsLINT - but it just said everything was an error! haha
[16:30:39] <coldhead> jslint is a fascist
[16:30:46] <nathanw> coldhead: this one is much better!!!! thanks!!! bookmarking that one :D
[16:31:04] <Dave_Stein> if something is broken in IE only, its most likely bad comma that jslint will show you in a second
[16:31:11] <coldhead> nathanw: your frustration is exactly why jshint was created
[16:31:37] <nathanw> only 3 errors in stead of a page as long as my arm, JSLint is over the top lol
[16:31:41] <nathanw> Line 2: $("input[name^=qty_item_]").bind("keyup", recalc); '$' is not defined. Line 2: $("input[name^=qty_item_]").bind("keyup", recalc); 'recalc' is not defined. Line 4: }); Expected '(end)' and instead saw '}'.
[16:31:53] <Dave_Stein> nathanw: put $ as a predefined at bottom of screen
[16:31:54] <Dave_Stein> its near options
[16:32:22] <coldhead> jslint is good at finding the ways in which your code differs from crockford's
[16:32:23] <miceiken> what's a "use strict" statement
[16:32:38] <miceiken> and how come confirm is not defined? :(
[16:32:55] <Dave_Stein> miceiken: ughhh its something about globals i can't recall but i just read that using that, slows down V8
[16:33:01] <nathanw> ah, 'assume jQuery'
[16:33:06] <Dave_Stein> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it
[16:33:25] <nathanw> now only,   Line 2: $("input[name^=qty_item_]").bind("keyup", recalc); 'recalc' is not defined.         Line 4: }); Expected '(end)' and instead saw '}'.
[16:33:48] <coldhead> nathanw: if you know recalc is being defined then you can safely ignore it
[16:34:01] <coldhead> line 4 sounds more significant
[16:34:18] <coldhead> might you be missing an opening { or ( ?
[16:34:18] <nathanw> coldhead: yeah I just moved that line of code to after recalc is defined and that error is gone
[16:34:48] <coldhead> cool
[16:34:57] <nathanw> http://jsfiddle.net/99Dp8/
[16:35:22] <nathanw> Coldhead: after moving that line of code errors changed,   Line 3: $("[id^=total_item]").calc("qty * price", { Missing "use strict" statement.        Line 7: return "$" + a.toFixed(2) Missing semicolon.          Line 17: }); Expected '(end)' and instead saw '}'.
[16:35:40] <Dave_Stein> put a semicolon on end after (2)
[16:35:41] <Dave_Stein> :D
[16:36:47] <coldhead> good work dave :)
[16:36:58] <miceiken> i wonder what would happen if you put jquery through jshint
[16:37:18] <vladikoff> miceiken, black hole, don't do it!
[16:37:22] <Dave_Stein> haha
[16:37:50] <Dave_Stein> i started rewritting draggable, i think that'd pass
[16:37:53] <Dave_Stein> :)
[16:38:12] <miceiken> lol
[16:38:19] <miceiken> how hard is it to make your own lightbox plugin?
[16:38:34] <miceiken> I kind of need one for one of my big projects, but none of the existing suits my needs.
[16:38:39] <coldhead> how hard is it to reinvent the wheel?
[16:38:46] <Dave_Stein> i did that, but then fancybox does it all anyway ha
[16:38:48] <miceiken> read the line above :P
[16:38:51] <Dave_Stein> we moved from my own to fancybo
[16:38:54] <Dave_Stein> what could you possibly need
[16:38:57] <coldhead> you're probably better off taking an existing one and extending it
[16:40:45] <miceiken> hmm
[16:41:14] <miceiken> well, basicly what I need is an overlay to show a fullsize picture, preferably a toolbar underneath, description and eventually comments
[16:41:36] <Dave_Stein> it sounds like you want a template that you just add to content of fancybox
[16:41:43] <Dave_Stein> and you can def make a thing to extend over that
[16:42:22] <nathanw> Ok i'm only getting 'Missing "use strict" statement.' error's now
[16:42:35] <Dave_Stein> you can use the option to remove that as a req
[16:42:41] <Dave_Stein> coldhead: do you ever use that?
[16:46:28] <nathanw> oh ok see it now
[16:46:29] <nathanw> d = parseInt(d); Missing radix parameter.
[16:47:24] <nathanw> what does that mean?
[16:48:45] <nathanw> also seeing this a bit too, what's the difference between them?    Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.
[16:50:15] <saddishwasher> hey, is there a plugin for themed input, select, button, textarea, etc. much like jquery ui themes?
[16:51:40] <nathanw> yeah niceforms ?
[16:52:57] <saddishwasher> niceforms looks...nice
[16:53:07] <nathanw> haha
[16:53:26] <nathanw> Unexpected call to method or property access. Line: 103 Char: 460 Code: 0 URI: http://www.microhire.com/js/jquery.min.js    <--- IE   why?
[16:55:10] <saddishwasher> because IE sucks
[16:56:14] <nathanw> i know this
[16:56:15] <nathanw> any ideas
[16:57:27] <coldhead> Dave_Stein: i usually just run stock standard jshint and ignore the errors i don't care about
[16:58:17] <saddishwasher> nathanw, I'm on my mac so I cannot test it. sorry
[17:04:11] <nathanw> saddishwasher: i'm on a mac too.... just using RDC to test windows :)
[17:14:11] <saddishwasher> does anyone know of a place to get an extended list of ui theme framework icons? I'm looking for more...
[17:14:57] <Dave_Stein> ?g jquery ui icons
[17:14:59] <bot-t1> Dave_Stein, jQuery UI - ThemeRoller - http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[17:15:30] <saddishwasher> Dave_Stein, I know about those, I'm looking for more
[17:15:44] <vladikoff> saddishwasher, http://tdanryan.com/demo/jqcustomicons/demo.html
[17:15:59] <coldhead> nathanw: parseInt requires a radix otherwise it will assume a number with a leading zero is in octal
[17:16:16] <coldhead> ?eval parseInt('010')
[17:16:17] <bot-t1> coldhead: 8
[17:16:30] <coldhead> ?eval parseInt('010', 10)
[17:16:31] <bot-t1> coldhead: 10
[17:16:42] <coldhead> it's "safer" to supply the radix
[17:17:26] <Dave_Stein> it's funny i got zip2tax and their backend tool is fucked up. i was on support with them for an issue and told em to try 07726 and it wouldn't work for em
[17:17:35] <Dave_Stein> their tool probably sends in the int instead of the string :D
[17:17:37] <coldhead> nathanw: and this explains === https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Using_the_Equality_Operators
[17:18:05] <vladikoff> saddishwasher, you can add your own icons from some other icon set using this: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Theming/API#Icon_types
[17:21:41] <joikus> hi you guys
[17:22:05] <joikus> what's a nice clean way to put some invisible overlay on my container to make everything unclickable
[17:22:24] <joikus> or at least, disable all <a> clicks
[17:22:38] <joikus> I rather not touch the innerhtml, I rather put something on top of it
[17:22:52] <Dave_Stein> $('a').bind( 'click', x ); x = function( e ) { e.preventDefault(); };
[17:23:01] <Dave_Stein> $('a').unbind( 'click', x );
[17:23:17] <Dave_Stein> with more attention to globals than that example :)
[17:24:23] <joikus> wait
[17:24:26] <joikus> which of the 2 lol
[17:24:33] <joikus> the bind one with the preventDefault, or the unbind one
[17:24:36] <Eviltwin> Can't you just do $('a').bind('click',false);
[17:24:44] <Eviltwin> And $('a').unbind(false) later
[17:24:57] <joikus> I don't need to undo
[17:25:17] <joikus> when I load up the html inside an overlay, I can call this unbind
[17:25:32] <nathanw> Dave: any ideas about me IE issues ?
[17:26:32] <coldhead> Eviltwin: false won't do the stopProp
[17:29:15] <joikus>  $('a').bind('click', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); });  worked like a charm
[17:31:27] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Isn't it the same as a return false/
[17:32:30] <coldhead> maybe you're right, Eviltwin
[17:32:36] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[17:32:46] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Which is why you're an op here :P
[17:33:01] <coldhead> i'm sure that's a mistake
[17:33:48] <Eviltwin> Well I'm pretty sure it's the same as a return false
[17:33:59] <Eviltwin> Which is both preventDefault and stopPropagation
[17:36:26] <tregeagle> I'm stuck. Why won't my current item toggle - http://paste.debian.net/137205/
[17:36:55] <tregeagle> Sorry I'm a jquery n00b
[17:37:13] <nathanw> IE seems to have issues with this section of code, can someone help rewrite in another way ?  - http://jsfiddle.net/BkRE5/
[17:38:10] <nathanw> tregeagle what are you trying to toggle ?
[17:38:17] <Eviltwin> tregeagle: Can you make a jsFiddle example?
[17:38:39] <tregeagle> forgot about jsfiddle , will do...
[17:38:44] <tregeagle> thx
[17:39:16] <Eviltwin> nathanw: .sum() ?
[17:39:18] <coldhead> i'm inclined to agree, Eviltwin
[17:41:28] <nathanw> Eviltwin: there's a plugin involved.... is there something wrong that .sum() ?
[17:42:29] <Eviltwin> nathanw: Would be useful to see the plugin maybe?
[17:43:03] <nathanw> Eviltwin: http://goo.gl/OzTJk
[17:43:32] <Eviltwin> Where is it failing in IE?
[17:44:25] <Eviltwin> Might it be this plugin?
[17:44:58] <nathanw> Eviltwin: I just narrowed it down a bit more.. looks like it's only failing on servicesCalc();
[17:45:07] <nathanw> I'll post the code for that..
[17:45:26] <nathanw> and the plugin was working in IE earlier I 've just tried to add something in
[17:45:56] <nathanw> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/BkRE5/1/
[17:47:32] <Eviltwin> Looks messy
[17:47:36] <Eviltwin> You can't narrow it down any more?
[17:47:56] <nathanw> I'll take a look on the plugin page, i must be formatting something wrong
[17:52:11] <nathanw> Eviltwin: the interesting thing is that the function still executes... just prevent default doesn't work and it jumps to the top of the screen
[17:58:14] <nathanw> can I put functions inside a function ?
[17:58:41] <nathanw> so say if i have one(); two(); three();  - can i put them all inside group(); ?
[17:58:46] <coldhead> it's okay with me, nathanw
[17:59:06] <ejfox> Hi, when doing a for() is it possible to do something like if( between(5,10) ) ? I'm trying to see if a number is between two other numbers.
[17:59:38] <mnereson> Is there a hash/map-like collection for jquery - like prototype's hash? http://www.prototypejs.org/api/hash
[17:59:42] <tregeagle> OK stuck my example in jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/tregeagle/M93YQ/ - anybody know why I cannot make it toggle
[18:00:21] <nathanw> function servicesCalc(){ techCalc(); secondSubCalc(); GSTCalc(); grandTotalCalc(); formTotalCalc(); }
[18:00:43] <coldhead> ejfox: there's nothing built-in to JS but you can write a between() yourself
[18:00:44] <mnereson> tregeagle: if (!$el.hasClass("current")) has no else...
[18:02:04] <ejfox> coldhead: Alrighty
[18:02:08] <ejfox> thanks for your help
[18:02:19] <tregeagle> mnereson: computing... think I get it
[18:02:42] <tregeagle> doh, of course
[18:02:58] <mnereson> tregeagle: ( :
[18:03:22] <Eviltwin> ejfox: if(i > 5 && i < 10) { ... }
[18:04:13] <tregeagle> mnereson: would you suggest I put in an 'else' statement? or should I rewrite the whole thing?
[18:06:27] <tregeagle> mnereson: don't worry, i think the else statement works. Thanks

[18:25:25] <nathanw> http://jsfiddle.net/BkRE5/2/     <--- is this the best way to select all options in a <select>
[18:25:37] <Dave_Stein> Skautroll: and check firebug to see what params you sent over
[18:26:31] <Skautroll> ill have a look
[18:26:59] <plut0> coldhead: thank you

[18:29:34] <klokkett> !lista
[18:29:50] <nathanw> Dave: lol why? I'll use a text area or something else instead if you can help me alter my code

[18:31:34] <Dave_Stein> nathanw: http://jsfiddle.net/BkRE5/5/ or http://jsfiddle.net/BkRE5/4/ works
[18:31:46] <Dave_Stein> actually 5 is bad ha one sec
[18:31:56] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/BkRE5/6/
[18:32:08] <Dave_Stein> so 4 uses attr so you set selected = selected, but 6 uses prop so you can just set selected to true
[18:32:09] <fat_Mike>  Hello, I have an if(!empty($variable)) { echo "div";} in php, I can't get jquery to fade in my div. Everything works besides the jquery, any pointers? http://jsfiddle.net/dbNPG/
[18:33:00] <Dave_Stein> $('div.box.green')hide()
[18:33:04] <Dave_Stein> should be $('div.box.green').hide()
[18:33:16] <Dave_Stein> and fadeIn(slow) should be fadeIn('slow')
[18:33:31] <fat_Mike> thanks Dave_Stein, off to try it out :)
[18:33:45] <Dave_Stein> also that's a real bad selector in css you might as well just do .box.green
[18:33:50] <Dave_Stein> adding div slows it down i believe
[18:35:58] <fat_Mike> worked Dave_Stein: Thank you
[18:36:13] <Dave_Stein> fat_Mike: syntax syntax syntax :)

[18:47:50] <Dave_Stein> np
[18:48:07] <Dave_Stein> i think prop is preferred these days
[18:59:03] <plut0> does jquery have a way to throttle events?
[19:17:13] <K1ng> hi
[19:17:35] <vladikoff> hey K1ng, welcome to #jquery!
[19:17:47] <K1ng> you mean welcome back?
[19:18:03] <Conti> does anyone in here happen to know how to get a jquery select() function to select text in an input box on iOS - mobile safari appears to not support select() at all - I've used over a half dozen different methods now that work on all other webkit based browsers with no luck
[19:18:17] <K1ng> can anyone help me make changes on a jquery ui plugin.
[19:18:52] <K1ng> https://github.com/Mottie/Keyboard
[19:18:55] <K1ng> this plugin
[19:20:29] <K1ng> the keyboard support combo.
[19:20:57] <K1ng> for example e.g. ' + e = é
[19:21:06] <ranskran> hey is there a way to call a custom widget without a selector? i'd like to have methods that operate on the plugin as a whole and not individual elements? or do i have to just do something like $.myPlugin = ...?
[19:21:21] <K1ng> i want to change it to e + ' = é
[19:23:31] <K1ng> https://github.com/Mottie/Keyboard/blob/master/js/jquery.keyboard.js
[19:23:56] <K1ng> the function is called checkCombos()
[19:24:12] <K1ng> line: 595
[19:34:05] <K1ng> anyone?
[19:34:36] <aro> hi
[19:34:41] <aro> whats up
[19:37:51] <aro> K1ng
[19:38:03] <K1ng> yes?
[19:38:28] <K1ng> hi
[19:38:31] <aro> whats your problem?
[19:38:35] <K1ng> i need help with a plugin
[19:38:42] <aro> whats going on
[19:39:28] <K1ng> please read http://pastebin.com/ue3tfUHC
[19:40:09] <aro> im reading what you wrote.. what do you mean by you want to change it to e + ' = ...
[19:41:04] <K1ng> currently its works with ` + e = é
[19:41:25] <K1ng> i just cant figure out how to change it to e + ` = é
[19:41:40] <aro> i guess i dont understand, whats the difference?
[19:42:52] <K1ng> because its default for Yoruba keyboard
[19:43:20] <aro> do you have an implementation of this somewhere i can look at
[19:43:58] <K1ng> i havent but i can host it for you :)
[19:44:23] <aro> ok
[19:44:28] <aro> jsfiddle should work no?
[19:45:20] <K1ng> yeah but a lot of files
[19:45:46] <aro> oh ok
[19:46:24] <K1ng> k1ngdom.net/keyboard/layouts.html
[19:46:26] <K1ng> http://k1ngdom.net/keyboard/layouts.html
[19:46:49] <aro> ok got it
[19:46:52] <aro> now tell me what to do
[19:46:59] <K1ng> type ` + a
[19:47:13] <K1ng> its being changed to à
[19:47:21] <K1ng> i just want to move the ` after a
[19:47:30] <aro> ahhhh
[19:47:32] <aro> i see
[19:47:33] <K1ng> like a then ` will replace with à
[19:47:44] <aro> why do you want it that way instead?
[19:47:51] <K1ng> <K1ng> because its default for Yoruba keyboard
[19:48:02] <aro> ok
[19:48:04] <aro> ok
[19:49:40] <K1ng> aro, see the java applet http://www.abeokuta.org/yoruba/?p=6105&cpage=1#comment-381
[19:51:10] <aro> ok hang on
[19:52:13] <aro> its a little different because the plugin operates on those certain keys acting as activators for the plugin
[19:54:56] <aro> line 298
[19:55:20] <aro> oops
[19:55:21] <aro> hang on
[19:56:27] <aro> line 1199
[19:56:28] <aro> you ass
[19:57:18] <aro> K1ng
[19:58:05] <K1ng> sorry
[19:58:08] <aro> yeah you are
[19:58:13] <K1ng> connection problem
[19:58:21] <aro> dialup?
[19:58:24] <K1ng> what did i missed
[19:58:27] <K1ng> no wimax
[19:58:27] <aro> i didnt think that existed anymore
[19:58:33] <aro> line 1199
[19:58:38] <aro> did you look at that?
[19:58:53] <K1ng> yes i did
[19:59:08] <K1ng> 1217
[19:59:33] <aro> this should be a no brainer?
[20:00:01] <aro> its going to be a lot of overhead i think though
[20:00:14] <aro> well
[20:00:23] <aro> you can probably write a map
[20:00:48] <aro> so for each alphabet char that has accents, map it to the `'s
[20:02:32] <aro> you have gone again havent you
[20:03:03] <K1ng> no
[20:03:18] <K1ng> it would be easier another way
[20:03:46] <aro> explain
[20:03:50] <aro> you could match with regex
[20:03:55] <aro> and map to an object
[20:04:33] <K1ng> yeah i can
[20:04:36] <K1ng> :D
[20:04:49] <aro> is that what you are looking for?
[20:05:14] <K1ng> yes
[20:05:30] <aro> i can help if you want
[20:05:36] <K1ng> but it would be a lot better if i can do like "'" : { a:"\u00e1", A:"\u00c1", e:"\u00e9", E:"\u00c9", i:"\u00ed", I:"\u00cd", o:"\u00f3", O:"\u00d3", u:"\u00fa", U:"\u00da", y:"\u00fd", Y:"\u00dd" }, // acute & cedilla
[20:05:47] <K1ng> in another way
[20:05:51] <aro> well
[20:05:54] <aro> hmm
[20:05:55] <aro> hang on
[20:06:00] <K1ng> 	$.keyboard.comboRegex = /([a-z])([`\'~\^\"ao])/mig;
[20:06:02] <K1ng> didnt work
[20:07:02] <aro> of course it wont
[20:09:05] <aro> hang on
[20:09:51] <aro> do you want to add an exception? or make it this way for ALL
[20:10:09] <K1ng> not for all.
[20:10:19] <K1ng> i want to define like it is now
[20:12:11] <K1ng> o.combos[accent][letter]
[20:12:14] <K1ng> yeah
[20:12:15] <K1ng> thats it
[20:12:26] <aro> got it?
[20:12:42] <K1ng> yep
[20:12:43] <K1ng> :D
[20:12:47] <aro> excelent
[20:12:49] <K1ng> 615
[20:12:50] <K1ng> :D
[20:14:09] <K1ng> combos (line 1198) needed to be rewritten
[20:15:57] <K1ng> oh no i didnt aro :(
[20:19:10] <nathanw> $("#selectedEquipment").append("<option id=" + c + " >" + $(this).closest("li").find("input.qty").val() + "x " + $(this).closest("li").find("p").text() + "</option>");     <---- how do I make that selected by default
[20:20:26] <K1ng> nathanw, show us the whole code and explain more
[20:21:05] <nathanw> k1ng: basically I have jQuery creating <options> inside a select on a button click, containing product data
[20:21:43] <nathanw> k1ng: they options need to be 'selected' to send in the form properly. I have a code in place which works in everything except IE that auto selects on submit click
[20:21:53] <nathanw> k1ng: ill post what i've got, standby
[20:22:31] <K1ng> nathanw, fiddle it please
[20:22:40] <nathanw> http://jsfiddle.net/Th77S/
[20:23:24] <Spadeski> Sup people
[20:25:53] <vladikoff> hey Spadeski!
[20:26:07] <Spadeski> Sup vladikoff
[20:26:16] <vladikoff> Spadeski, just some jaqueries
[20:26:46] <nathanw> k1ng: as far as I can tell... it's only IE that doesn't like the select all
[20:26:47] <Spadeski> same here just got editable plugin workin now im goldem
[20:26:50] <Spadeski> golden
[20:27:05] <nathanw> k1ng: so I was thinking of rendering them with the selected option, but i can't figure out how
[20:27:43] <K1ng> show me everything
[20:33:59] <nathanw> k1ng: http://goo.gl/Z7xaA   <--- project page
[20:37:33] <nathanw> k1ng: add a product to the order and click place order, the select i'm talking about is called selected equipment
[20:40:10] <ryanneufeld> gnarf:  you around?
[20:41:23] <gnarf> sup
[20:41:28] <nathanw> nm
[20:42:48] <ryanneufeld> well, I just realized, I'd really really like to be able to sort as the use is dropping on that destination list
[20:43:18] <TheRedOctober> Greetings all. I have a simple image rotator humming along on setInterval that seems to misbehave (ie parent div gets opacity settings applied), but only  after the window has been minimized for a while. Can anyone clue me in as to the cause?
[20:43:43] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i figured you would
[20:43:57] <ryanneufeld> does that mean you have a suggestion?
[20:44:00] <gnarf> nope
[20:44:03] <gnarf> i asked around
[20:44:03] <ryanneufeld> dang
[20:44:54] <gnarf> the only thing i could think of is really really hackish
[20:45:05] <gnarf> and i couldn't get it to work anyway
[20:45:11] <ryanneufeld> like error prone hackish?
[20:45:33] <gnarf> but i had this theory that as i drug an element over a dropzone, i might be able to add it to the dest list and start a sortable drag
[20:45:45] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[20:45:46] <gnarf> but i couldn't get it to work
[20:45:56] <ryanneufeld> but the end of the first drag hadn't happened yet
[20:45:59] <ryanneufeld> so.. yeah
[20:46:09] <gnarf> right, but if you remove it
[20:46:24] <gnarf> and or trigger the actual drag to stop
[20:46:33] <gnarf> i was digging around in the 1.8 source about it
[20:46:39] <ryanneufeld> trigger the dragstop event
[20:46:51] <ryanneufeld> then trigger the sortstart event maybe?
[20:47:11] <gnarf> yeah, i played with it for a little bit
[20:47:14] <gnarf> never got it working
[20:47:15] <gnarf> ?twss
[20:47:16] <bot-t1> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[20:47:34] <ryanneufeld> hrm
[20:47:53] <ryanneufeld> well, I suppose it's not the end of the world
[20:48:05] <ryanneufeld> would just be nice to have that functionality
[20:48:08] <gnarf> i might bring it up tomorrow during the day
[20:48:18] <gnarf> might see if scott_gonzalez can think of a clever solution
[20:48:24] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it would be cool pull off
[20:48:28] <ryanneufeld> and would be a fantastic UX
[20:48:43] <gnarf> well like, i can imagine more than you would want that interaction
[20:48:48] <ryanneufeld> I've been showing computer illiterates the UI and they're like "Why doesn't everything work that way?"
[20:48:51] <aro> arf arf
[20:48:52] <gnarf> if we can find some way to support it, it would be nice
[20:49:25] <ryanneufeld> well, I followed you on the twitter, so ping me if you want any more feedback or whatever
[20:49:29] <ryanneufeld> anything I can do to help
[20:49:31] <ryanneufeld> would be cool
[20:53:27] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: can you send me the demo fiddle you made the other day again?
[20:53:32] <ryanneufeld> yup
[20:53:45] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/TeUEq/
[20:54:32] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i'll pass it around the UI team
[20:54:36] <gnarf> see if its possible
[20:54:44] <gnarf> or if they can think of a better implementation
[20:54:47] <gnarf> kborchers: you here?
[20:55:02] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: you're using 1.8 right?
[20:55:20] <ryanneufeld> yes
[20:55:47] <ryanneufeld> I just updated it to reflect the functionality I was going for
[20:55:56] <ryanneufeld> it's similar to the shopping cart demo
[20:56:12] <ryanneufeld> however the cart in this case would be sortable right away
[21:00:46] <nathanw> append("<option id=" + c + " >" + $(this).closest("li").find("input.qty").val() + "x " + $(this).closest("li").find("p").text() + "</option>");
[21:00:59] <nathanw> how do I make it create <option selected="selected">
[21:01:07] <ryanneufeld> ?p
[21:01:08] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:03:51] <kborchers> gnarf: I was just about to crash for the night. Sup?
[21:05:47] <nathanw> anyone?
[21:05:58] <nathanw> how to render a an option with the value, selected?
[21:06:04] <gnarf> kborchers: crash anyway, i'll ask tomorrow, just didn't know if you had ever dug into sortable yet
[21:06:36] <gnarf> kborchers: ryanneufeld has been trying to get this interesting behavior out of a sortable
[21:06:47] <gnarf> but i haven't seen a way to implement it yet
[21:06:49] <ryanneufeld> Indeed I have
[21:06:51] <gnarf> trying to come up with something
[21:07:18] <kborchers> Not too much. What u trying to do?
[21:07:29] <ryanneufeld> connected sortables
[21:07:31] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/TeUEq/
[21:07:41] <ryanneufeld> where only one is actually sortable
[21:07:59] <ryanneufeld> I'm close in what I have thanks to gnarf, but I can only sort after I've dropped
[21:08:13] <ryanneufeld> think shopping cart
[21:08:46] <ryanneufeld> one way drag and drop, but when you get over the droppable list you can sort without having to first drop the item
[21:10:06] <kborchers> Hmmm, that is interesting
[21:10:44] <coldhead> ?mlu
[21:10:45] <bot-t1> much like urself
[21:10:57] <ryanneufeld> ah coldhead, I've missed you
[21:11:18] <coldhead> no you haven't
[21:11:22] <ryanneufeld> you're right
[21:11:24] <kborchers> Unfortunately I can't play with draggable stuff right now as I'm on my iPad.
[21:11:37] <kborchers> Can't wait till we start working on sorting that out
[21:11:41] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that was gonna be my next challenge... getting it to work on my ipad :p

[21:41:14] <cypha> coldhead, didn't know you were bigtime like that
[21:41:18] <ryanneufeld> http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/317459_10150322633431824_554071823_8279793_1620615663_n.jpg
[21:42:19] <ryanneufeld> well that was fun
[21:42:21] <ryanneufeld> I'm outie
[21:45:19] <coldhead> cypha: i'm not
[21:45:28] <coldhead> i can barely dress myself
[21:45:55] <cypha> lmao
[21:46:15] <cypha> well, u seem dignantly decorated here ;)
[21:48:02] <xp_prg> how all, I want to clear the entire html page, I try this: $.empty(); but doesn't work
[21:50:11] <coldhead> $('body').empty()
[21:50:42] <xp_prg> sweet thanks!
[22:00:21] <coldhead> damn too slow
[22:00:48] <cypha> coldhead, how do you feel about dojo?
[22:02:01] <coldhead> i look forward to using it
[22:02:11] <coldhead> it looks very well designed
[22:02:52] <coldhead> unforunately i am in legacy mode lately so there's no room to use it
[22:04:04] <cypha> it's older than jquery, I wonder how come it never caught on
[22:05:32] <coldhead> because it's so easy to sneak jQuery into an existing project
[22:05:45] <coldhead> it's more like duct tape
[22:05:57] <coldhead> dojo is more like "let's build our skyscraper this way"
[22:06:28] <coldhead> it's caught on
[22:17:07] <gnarf> i actually know more dojo developers locally than jQuery people
[22:17:21] <gnarf> but they do monolithic application code ;)
[22:19:03] <coldhead> that's what you get for socialising with creative anachronists
[22:25:01] <gnarf> coldhead: are you aware of any masters of sortable?
[22:52:31] <coldhead> gnarf: ajpiano is my sortable master
[22:52:35] <coldhead> also yourself
[22:52:40] <coldhead> or you were until now!
[22:52:51] <Zerks> you let him down man
[22:53:28] <coldhead> story of my life
[22:53:37] <coldhead> as a hangman
[22:53:39] <coldhead> bahahaha
[22:53:46] <Zerks> how's your first day here going
[22:54:00] <beasty> hmm
[22:54:12] * beasty gives coldhead some water and a asperine 
[22:54:20] <beasty> time to go to sleep buddy :p
[22:54:31] <coldhead> i wish!
[22:54:41] <coldhead> it's okay thanks Zerks, people are being nice
[22:54:55] <coldhead> tolerating my mistakes and noob blunders
[22:55:09] <beasty> coldhead: u wish ?
[22:55:22] <coldhead> i wish it were sleep time
[22:55:32] <beasty> wat time do you have ?
[22:55:49] <coldhead> instead of electroshock treatment time
[22:55:51] <coldhead> i have17:00
[22:56:01] <beasty> that's almost naptime :)
[22:56:06] <coldhead> i am just. getting. started
[22:56:16] <beasty> weird
[22:56:31] <beasty> here it's 7:58 and i'm also getting started
[22:56:37] <Zerks> here it's 1am
[22:56:41] <Zerks> none of you in america eh
[22:56:53] <Zerks> should it be sleeptime for me
[22:57:20] <coldhead> america wouldn't have me
[22:57:27] <coldhead> or i would be asleep there now
[22:57:32] <coldhead> occupying wallstreet
[22:57:36] <Zerks> that's ok, we in #jquery accept you
[22:58:15] <beasty> haha
[22:58:22] <Zerks> has bot-t1 replaced bot-t or something
[22:58:34] <coldhead> he wanted a change
[22:58:40] <coldhead> throw off the bot-t baggage
[22:58:41] <beasty> maybe you should start up a channel named #wallstreet and just idle there :p
[22:58:43] <coldhead> a fresh start
[22:58:43] <Zerks> that's good, change is good
[22:59:00] <JakeyChan> hi ?
[22:59:42] <coldhead> what do you want
[22:59:54] <Zerks> bot-t1, I like your new name
[22:59:55] <bot-t1> Zerks, Attribute Starts With Selector [name^="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[23:00:00] <Zerks> always helpful
[23:00:09] <Zerks> I never know what help I need until he gives me an answer
[23:00:52] <coldhead> well said
[23:02:24] <Zerks> I should just close mirc on my PC so I can have my Zerxer name back
[23:02:57] <coldhead> oh you're that guy
[23:03:05] <coldhead> good thing i wasn't badmouthing him
[23:03:16] <beasty> mirc
[23:03:22] <beasty> that still excists?
[23:03:26] <Zerks> strangely
[23:03:32] <szabyg> Hi people, am right here if I have a question about jQuery UI or is that another channel?
[23:03:38] <Zerks> I got a macbook pro for work now so now I'm on colloquy and hoping that's a good one to use
[23:03:47] <Zerks> I used to badmouth apple but I really like this thing :'(
[23:03:59] <beasty> Zerks: i know the feeling
[23:04:02] <Zerks> ?ask
[23:04:03] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:04:04] <coldhead> sadly this is the right place, szabyg
[23:04:45] <beasty> Zerks: i used to be a apple fanboy to :)
[23:05:00] <Zerxer> bye man
[23:05:06] <coldhead> sup Zerxer
[23:05:15] <Zerxer> hey, you new here?
[23:05:19] <coldhead> we were just talking about you
[23:05:24] <coldhead> yeah first day
[23:05:27] <Zerxer> I still don't like apple's pricing and such but they do make a quality product I suppose
[23:05:54] <coldhead> i like how if you find a bug with some apple software you can just download the source and patch it yourself
[23:05:56] <ch3mi0n> Depends on who you ask
[23:06:10] <Zerxer> I'm still a fan of building my own desktop
[23:06:16] <Zerxer> but I like this more than the laptop I had gotten back in june
[23:06:24] <beasty> mm coffee
[23:06:45] <Zerxer> I feel more productive on it, mission control helps your mind feel less cluttered
[23:06:57] <gnarf> coldhead: yeah, this goes beyond my knowledge of sortable, pretty sure it heads into the impossible to do with sortable region :)
[23:06:58] <coldhead> so does heroin
[23:07:28] <beasty> hmm
[23:07:40] <Zerxer> I remember using sortable on some stuff, now I probably don't remember how to use it
[23:08:29] <Zerxer> since no one is really talking about jquery in here at the moment, anyone have any opinion on lithium and mongodb? thinking about using them both for a project maybe
[23:09:00] <gnarf> not lithium
[23:09:06] <gnarf> but mongodb rocks
[23:09:09] <gnarf> and i <3 it
[23:09:10] <ch3mi0n> Why not just use local db?
[23:09:27] <beasty> what is mongodb ?
[23:09:29] <Zerxer> mongodb looks like a lot of fun, unless you need complex queries
[23:09:30] <Zerxer> then I am scared
[23:09:45] <mekwall> beasty: a document based databased much like couchdb
[23:09:51] <Zerxer> but I think it may come in handy for something where I'll be storing lots of small amounts of data, similar to a twitter timeline
[23:10:04] <mekwall> beasty: http://www.mongodb.org/
[23:10:08] <beasty> mekwall: and what's couchdb ?
[23:10:15] <gnarf> Zerxer: complex queries aren't as complicated as you expect
[23:10:20] <mekwall> beasty: a document based database much like mongodb
[23:10:20] <mekwall> :D
[23:10:22] <ch3mi0n> ?g couchdb
[23:10:23] <bot-t1> ch3mi0n, Apache CouchDB: The Apache CouchDB Project - http://couchdb.apache.org/
[23:10:24] <Zerxer> lithium was started by one of the cakephp creators I think, and makes use of a lot of new php 5.3 features, so it seems good
[23:10:32] <beasty> mekwall: :)
[23:10:34] <gnarf> Zerxer: the trick with mongo is just smart indexing
[23:10:55] <coldhead> couchdb hates women
[23:10:57] <gnarf> Zerxer: and throwing everything you knew about SQL data out the window
[23:11:07] <coldhead> if you like women you won't use couchdb
[23:11:19] <mekwall> that's why coldhead uses couchdb
[23:11:41] <beasty> i like couches to
[23:12:00] <coldhead> i like women so much i don't use ANY databases
[23:12:09] <Zerxer> gnarf: it seems tricky when you want more complicated JOINs and stuff. also some of the querying just seems annoying. like having to use $gt obviously takes more to write than just doing col>val, or when you want to do ORs having to throw in a whole separate inner array
[23:12:10] <coldhead> cookies are MY database
[23:12:12] <Zerxer> but it still looks like a lot of fun
[23:12:23] <coldhead> JOINs suck
[23:12:37] <beasty> coldhead: so you like women eh
[23:12:43] <Zerxer> I found this online and it almost scared me: http://rickosborne.org/download/SQL-to-MongoDB.pdf
[23:12:48] <gnarf> Zerxer: "JOIN" isn't EVER needed in mongo
[23:12:54] <gnarf> because well, you can't do it ;)
[23:13:10] <gnarf> you just get smarter about storing index maps
[23:13:47] <mekwall> Zerxer: that's because you're stuck in the world of relational databases :D
[23:14:02] <gnarf> Zerxer: but like i said, throw away everything you know about SQL - and mongo gets easier
[23:14:13] <mekwall> yup
[23:14:42] <Zerxer> question about it: is there anything out there like phpMyAdmin, but for mongo? I know the command tool is pretty easy and nice to use, with having a javascript shell and all, but just wondering anyways. doubt I'll need it
[23:14:54] <mekwall> the only similarity between mongodb and an sql-database is that they both store data.
[23:15:27] <mekwall> Zerxer: there's myngo
[23:15:48] <coldhead> people sure seem to like data
[23:15:52] <szabyg> jQueryui 1.9m5, tooltip, content option which is a function with a response method. My problem is when my AJAX is quicker than the tooltip show animation then the tooltip is not yet shown and doesn't even get shown anymore.
[23:15:59] <mekwall> Zerxer: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Admin+UIs <-- It's all there though
[23:16:15] <juha_> morning peeps
[23:16:19] <gnarf> Zerxer: they shitty ones
[23:16:24] <juha_> man do i feel like getting some vodka right now
[23:16:29] <gnarf> Zerxer: i got really comfy with the command line
[23:16:33] <Zerxer> I like the command line
[23:16:37] <mekwall> juha_: hmm... don't you always?
[23:16:39] <gnarf> but i used one
[23:16:41] <gnarf> lemme find it
[23:16:48] <Zerxer> thanks for the link though mekwall
[23:16:52] <beasty> coldhead: did you know a single sperm contains 37.5MB of dna data :p
[23:17:03] <Zerxer> I read through most of mongo's docs yesterday
[23:17:04] <mekwall> Zerxer: Think you'll have better luck asking google though :)
[23:17:07] <Zerxer> now I'm trying to read through lithium's docs
[23:17:17] <mekwall> Zerxer: I use mongodb as well, but hosted.
[23:17:29] <Zerxer> lithium supports and recommends mongodb which is how I found mongo
[23:17:31] <mekwall> which is one of those things that mongodb does good :D
[23:17:40] <Zerxer> and at least if it's not for me I can easily fall back on sql by changing the connection type
[23:17:55] <Zerxer> or, run mongo and mysql side-by-side for different storage if needbe
[23:17:58] <mekwall> Zerxer: mongohq.com or mongolab.com
[23:18:00] <juha_> anyone using mongodb with php should check my open source project and give me some goddamn feedback
[23:18:05] <mekwall> Zerxer: if you dont want to host it yourself
[23:18:11] <Zerxer> let's rename this topic to mongodb
[23:18:14] <Zerxer> er channel
[23:18:16] <gnarf> Zerxer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3882929/is-there-a-tool-like-phpmyadmin-for-mongodb-databases :)
[23:18:19] <beasty> juha_: what project ?
[23:18:20] <mekwall> Zerxer: you can try it out for free as well
[23:18:29] <juha_> https://github.com/JuhQ/MongoHelper
[23:18:31] <gnarf> phpmoadmin was the one i used, but i didn't like
[23:18:36] <Zerxer> oh we have a dedicated server, so I'm playing on there
[23:18:47] <gnarf> but it worked out well
[23:18:48] <Zerxer> well, playing on my laptop's local installation for now
[23:18:49] <gnarf> to get used to it
[23:19:12] <gnarf> juha_: have you seen Shanty?
[23:19:22] <juha_> i have three sites running mongodb, building couple more at my free time
[23:19:30] <juha_> gnarf: never heard of it
[23:19:32] <coldhead> beasty: ew
[23:19:48] <gnarf> juha_: its a pretty awesome ORM with mongo/php
[23:20:03] <Zerxer> http://lithify.me is the lithium framework I'm talking about also
[23:20:32] <mekwall> the only thing I dislike with mongodb is its memory usage :P
[23:20:48] <Zerxer> I thought I read it uses less memory than typical mysql
[23:21:02] <juha_> gnarf: seems complicated
[23:21:11] <mekwall> not really... the db should reside in the memory for quick accesss
[23:21:13] <mekwall> -s
[23:21:55] <mekwall> sure its fast, but with a large db, you'll need a lot of RAM for high performance
[23:22:14] <mekwall> also, mongodb and openvz doesn't play well together :(
[23:22:22] <Zerxer> hmm good to know and keep in mind
[23:22:53] <Zerxer> I know we have 12GB RAM on our server right now, but some of it is allocated for a ramdisk and of course some is just already in use by other stuff
[23:23:03] <Zerxer> so I don't know what you'd classify as a lot for it
[23:23:47] <mekwall> Zerxer: depends on the size of the db
[23:24:00] <mekwall> Zerxer: if you have a 2GB db mongodb will try to put all of that in memory
[23:24:22] <mekwall> Zerxer: if it can't it will swap (and become horrendously slow)
[23:24:29] <gnarf> Zerxer: mongo scales horizontally
[23:24:37] <gnarf> so like, more data = more memory = more servers
[23:24:52] <mekwall> which is why a cloud based solution is great for mongodb
[23:24:57] <Zerxer> I see
[23:25:16] <Zerxer> ram is pretty cheap right now too, at least
[23:25:26] <mekwall> hell yeah :p
[23:25:45] <mekwall> man... my Dominator GTs that I bought 2 years ago goes for half the price today
[23:25:47] <Zerxer> unless you buy a dedicated server through a company who overcharges you
[23:25:58] <gnarf> mekwall: i set up a test server once to see how well mongo would perform with swapping to SSD's
[23:26:02] <mekwall> Zerxer: dedicated servers are old :P
[23:26:03] <gnarf> and well, it was pretty hot
[23:26:15] <mekwall> gnarf: SSDs yes
[23:26:22] <mekwall> gnarf: but then again, SSDs are quite expensive :P
[23:26:36] <mekwall> but yeah, it's cheaper then RAM
[23:27:05] <gnarf> hey mekwall
[23:27:16] <gnarf> you up to trying to solve a problem that i'm not sure can be solved?
[23:27:33] <mekwall> gnarf: depends on the nature of it ;)
[23:28:00] <gnarf> mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/TeUEq/
[23:28:07] <gnarf> he's come in here a few times
[23:28:13] <gnarf> i helped him get it to the point its at now
[23:28:18] <gnarf> but the general goal here
[23:28:42] <gnarf> is to drag an item from a "source" list (which isn't sortable) into a "destination" list (which is)
[23:28:47] <gnarf> and that part works
[23:29:10] <gnarf> but he's hoping we might be able to get it be "sortable" as its being drug in
[23:29:23] <mekwall> I see
[23:29:35] <mekwall> so that he can sort one from the source directly without having to drop it first
[23:29:41] <Zerxer> mekwall: so you'd recommend cloud-based storage over local on your own servers? wouldn't that mean you'd then have to rely on the remote site to always be up, and to always have a very speedy connection?
[23:30:06] <mekwall> Zerxer: we always rely on things we do not have control over
[23:30:12] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, i think it would be easier to not bend jquery ui for this.. not sure tho
[23:30:20] <mekwall> Zerxer: its just a matter of weighing one of the things against the other
[23:30:21] <Zerxer> also are SSDs cheaper than RAM? isn't a 60GB vertex 3 about the same price as 64GB DDR3? though that SSD is a really nice PCIE one
[23:30:37] <blackspotwiggins> vertex 3 isnt pcie
[23:31:01] <mekwall> Zerxer: if you have a dedicated server, you would still have to rely on your ISP and your electricity provider to be up at all times ;)
[23:31:06] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: i could agree with that
[23:31:16] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: and i'm sure ryan could too
[23:31:24] <gnarf> but like - draggable works well
[23:32:05] <gnarf> i mean, we we start rewriting sortable i'll gladly try to get this implemented somehow
[23:32:07] <blackspotwiggins> Zerxer, ram is about 3.5 times more expensive than ssd, per gb
[23:32:22] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, true that
[23:32:22] <JakeyChan> hi ?
[23:32:26] <mekwall> Zerxer: in my case I use cloud-based hosting for everything, and if both the web service and mongodb service exist in the same cloud, the communication will be done over fiber connections
[23:32:44] <Zerxer> do you use one of those sites you linked to me?
[23:33:01] <JakeyChan> is there have jquery plugin for across domain request with POST method ??
[23:33:08] <mekwall> Zerxer: for example... mongohq.com and mongolab.com uses amazon ec2 as their platform
[23:33:22] <Zerxer> Jakechan: you need to use a php file on your site to do the remote request and print out the response
[23:33:49] <mekwall> Zerxer: so if I run my web service on amazon as well, it will be nearly as having it on the same server
[23:33:53] <JakeyChan> hi ?
[23:34:11] <Zerxer> that's a nice thing to keep in mind
[23:34:17] <mekwall> Zerxer: I use both mongohq and mongolab :)
[23:34:17] <Zerxer> I'll have to consider amazon for my next project maybe
[23:34:27] <blackspotwiggins> Zerxer, reddit runs on ec2
[23:34:33] <blackspotwiggins> and it's not a small site by any means
[23:34:54] <mekwall> Zerxer: amazon is great... their pricing might be hard to understand though
[23:34:56] <Zerxer> why use both? for the same site or different projects?
[23:35:20] <mekwall> Zerxer: rackspace have similar cloud services
[23:35:28] <Zerxer> rackspace has a HQ near me too
[23:35:31] <mekwall> Zerxer: I use both because I use the free ones ;)
[23:35:43] <mekwall> Zerxer: only using it to play around with
[23:36:39] <mekwall> just wondering when the hell amazon will update their ugly ass interface
[23:36:55] <mekwall> it just stinks
[23:37:15] <blackspotwiggins> mekwall, their api is pretty sweet, you can write your own :D
[23:37:25] <mekwall> gnarf: I'm sure it can be solved, but would probably involve some hacking
[23:37:35] <mekwall> blackspotwiggins: their api is XML... YUCK
[23:37:40] <JakeSays> so do syncronous ajax calls run the risk of freezing the rest of the page?
[23:37:42] <gnarf> mekwall: i agree
[23:37:48] <gnarf> and intend to ask the ui team tomorrow
[23:37:55] <blackspotwiggins> mekwall, yeah but you dont have to handwrite xml anyway
[23:38:03] <gnarf> mainly because i think this interaction could be really useful for others too
[23:38:05] <blackspotwiggins> that's just transport
[23:38:08] <mekwall> gnarf: yeah it should definately be implemented
[23:38:18] <mekwall> blackspotwiggins: a shitty transport
[23:38:26] <mekwall> json all the way baby
[23:38:31] <gnarf> but mekwall - if you want to try to figure out any plans/idea's let me know if you come up with anything
[23:38:35] <blackspotwiggins> well yeah, but it can be abstracted away
[23:40:31] <sufbo> 1
[23:41:26] <mekwall> gnarf: wow... why does jqueryui.it show up before jqueryui.com on google? :D
[23:42:45] <gnarf> mekwall: we aren't sure, it started happening recently
[23:43:44] <gnarf> but i think we are on top of a) shutting it down / b) getting it off the top of the search results
[23:43:46] <mekwall> gnarf: jqueryui.it is official?
[23:43:53] <mekwall> ah ok
[23:44:00] <mekwall> good
[23:45:20] <Zerxer> I see what you mean about amazon's pricing being confusing :()
[23:47:01] <flam_> how do i get jquery object from a DOM node?
[23:47:21] <Zerxer> $(node) ?
[23:47:24] <chrislabeard> how can you disable a select field but still allow the value of it to be sent through post?
[23:47:51] <Zerxer> does setting disabled="disabled" stop it from being sent through post?
[23:48:08] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[23:48:17] <Zerxer> return false on change
[23:48:19] <blackspotwiggins> chrislabeard, you can try readonly
[23:48:20] <Zerxer> I guess
[23:48:29] <chrislabeard> blackspotwiggins: I believe that is only for textfields
[23:48:42] <Zerxer> blur on focus
[23:48:58] <nail_> either re-enable it in the submit handler, or replace it by a hidden field
[23:49:08] <Zerxer> that sounds like the better idea
[23:50:26] <gnarf> nail_: is on to something
[23:50:31] <gnarf> set it to be disabled
[23:50:44] <gnarf> and the take its current value and drop it in a hidden input and append it after the select
[23:51:00] <gnarf> remove the hidden if you ever re-enable it
[23:57:02] <mekwall> gnarf: nearly found a soltuion :P
[23:57:10] <mekwall> gnarf: solution* ... without hacking
[23:57:32] <JakeSays> anybody know of a tool that will generate js proxy methods for a wcf interface?
[23:59:09] <Burgov> hi
[23:59:29] <mekwall> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/TeUEq/9/
[23:59:34] <Burgov> is there any reason for "$("body").delegate("input[data-autocomplete]", 'keydown focus', function() { [...] })" not to work in IE8, or should I be looking for mistakes on another level?
[23:59:41] <mekwall> gnarf: its ugly, but seems to work :D
