[00:06:57] <puneet> djqueryCan anyone help me in modifying this http://pastebin.com/2EFvsHyn
[00:06:59] <intelligentfool> thanks Cork
[00:07:26] <puneet> this is actually giving a sliding effect to an arrow on hovering the menu link
[00:07:46] <Cork> puneet: "modifying" is way to generic question
[00:07:53] <puneet> I want this arrow to also return back to the active menu link
[00:08:15] <Cork> ?p @ puneet
[00:08:15] <bot-t> puneet, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:08:30] <Cork> and include the html that time (and make sure it runs)
[00:10:55] <ankr> Why is jsfiddle prefered over the others?
[00:15:14] <iateadonut> hi.  i'm binding tasks on a table that reloads
[00:15:23] <iateadonut> sometimes only parts of the table reload
[00:15:28] <Cork> ankr: cause its the one with the best interface
[00:15:45] <Cork> ankr: though its slowness from time to time makes that statement a bit harder to argue for
[00:15:50] <iateadonut> when that happens other parts that are not reloaded are bound to the function twice and so execute twice when triggered.
[00:15:58] <iateadonut> how can i avoid that?
[00:16:01] <puneet> Cork: Actually I cant be able toCork: http://jsfiddle.net/y3chT/
[00:16:21] <ankr> Cork, alright so it's that simple :) - What do you call tools like these? Pastebin doesn't seem to fit, really.
[00:16:25] <puneet> +bot-t http://jsfiddle.net/y3chT/
[00:16:58] <Cork> puneet: you need to include jquery in the dropdown on the left http://jsfiddle.net/y3chT/1/
[00:17:41] <raj> when jquery does $('select').val('new_york'), isn't it supposed to put `selected='selected'` in the selected option's attributes?
[00:17:52] <Cork> ankr: live editors/workbenches, i've heard plenty of names, but not a consensus
[00:18:01] <Cork> raj: no
[00:18:11] <Cork> attributes are for when the html is parsed
[00:18:11] <puneet> Cork: the script is working you can see on the right
[00:18:17] <Cork> its not updated when the dom is
[00:18:26] <ankr> Cork, I'm looking for a name for my bookmark folder;) Thanks though - I'll go with "JS Workbenches" :)
[00:18:39] <raj> ok
[00:18:57] <raj> thank you
[00:18:58] <xxx> can anyone check this http://www.fiestahomes.in/property.html
[00:19:02] <Cork> puneet: so it moves to the menu option hovered; then what?
[00:19:29] <raj> if I clone an option and it has `selected='selected'`, then what?
[00:19:30] <Cork> ankr: if you want to bookmark things http://www.webdevout.net/test is another good one
[00:19:31] <puneet> I want that whatever is the active link it will go back to that link
[00:19:39] <Cork> raj: then its not cloned
[00:19:41] <raj> to add other options
[00:19:43] <puneet> Cork I want that whatever is the active link it will go back to that link
[00:19:45] <Cork> oh wait it is
[00:19:45] <raj> oh ok, good
[00:19:55] <Cork> raj: it clones the state of the dom element
[00:20:03] <Cork> you would have to reset it
[00:20:12] <raj> ok
[00:20:21] <raj> how? :)
[00:20:38] <AdamPDotty> option.prop('selected', false);
[00:20:39] <Cork> $('select').val('')
[00:20:39] <ankr> Cork, sweet thanks! :) Maybe you don't know http://codepen.io/pen/ ?
[00:21:02] <raj> you said that .val() doesn't affect selected though
[00:21:04] <Cork> ankr: i do, haven't used it much though
[00:21:16] <Cork> raj: the selection is on <select> not option
[00:21:17] <raj> and from my trial, it doesn't either
[00:21:24] <Cork> options is just the default
[00:21:57] <Cork> selected on options is for when the browser parses it
[00:22:05] <Cork> everything else happens on select
[00:24:00] <puneet> Cork: li takes the active class on click
[00:24:24] <puneet> Cork Now what should I do to take back this arrow to the active class
[00:24:50] <Cork> puneet: i don't follow, it does what with active class?
[00:25:32] <puneet> Cork: have you got my point what I want?
[00:25:41] <raj> can I stash away a jquery object with .data()?
[00:25:47] <Cork> yes
[00:26:04] <Cork> you can store anything that can be stored in a variable
[00:26:10] <raj> data({'somekey':$select.clone()}) ?
[00:26:13] <Cork> (that means almost anything)
[00:26:35] <Cork> or just data('somekey', $select.clone())
[00:26:42] <Cork> but yes
[00:27:33] <Cork> puneet: no i already said i didn't follow
[00:27:58] <puneet> ok
[00:28:52] <puneet> Cork: I want theis arrowto return back to the active link
[00:29:48] <Cork> so you want to listen on mouseout and then move it you mean?
[00:30:19] <puneet> Cork : checkout this new file with active class on Home link http://jsfiddle.net/y3chT/3/
[00:31:18] <puneet> Cork: The arrow is moving on hovering the menu links ok
[00:32:04] <puneet> Cork: Now I want that this arrow will move on hovering as well as when we take the mouse out from the links then this arrow will return to the link which is active
[00:32:24] <Cork> sigh thanks took you long enough -_-
[00:40:17] <Cork> puneet: http://jsfiddle.net/y3chT/6/
[00:40:42] <roel_> hello, I have contentEditable-div and I want to fetch with jQuery the content in plainText with newlines. Is this possible?
[00:41:46] <Cork> roel_: plainText will include newlines if there is newlines in the div at the same place as the <br>'s
[00:41:53] <Cork> if there isn't then no it won't
[00:42:39] <roel_> Cork: you mean the function jQuer.plainText()? Can't find it on the api
[00:43:02] <Cork> roel_: $().text()
[00:43:15] <mazzachre> It is quite annoying that jsfiddle no longer works in IE8 at all... Before I could at least test if something was still backwards compatible, but not any longer :( And yes, unfortunately I am still forced to support that browser based on corporate decisions..
[00:43:27] <roel_> ah but Cork $().text() doesn't return newlines
[00:43:38] <roel_> it just paste everything on one line
[00:44:13] <roel_> because in chrome, they work with divs inside contenteditable
[00:44:21] <roel_> and in IE they work with P-tags
[00:44:32] <puneet> Cork: on hover the arrow is comes in the middle of the link but when I remove mouse pointer from the links it is not positioned in the middle
[00:44:33] <roel_> and in Firefox they work with <br />
[00:44:42] <roel_> haven't checked safari and opera
[00:44:44] <Cork> roel_: wfm console.log($("<div>this\nworks</div>").text())
[00:44:51] <puneet> Cork: The slider id always taking left:20px
[00:45:05] <Cork> roel_: you would have to append \n at each <br> element
[00:45:21] <roel_> so make a function for all browsers
[00:45:40] <roel_> thnx i thought that there was an easier way
[00:45:59] <Cork> sadly no
[00:46:10] <roel_> ok thnx!
[00:47:51] <Cork> puneet: you prob get a mouseout event for the ul element
[00:48:04] <Cork> you would have to find another element that will contain all the elements
[00:48:38] <puneet> Cork: I didnt got you
[00:49:03] <Cork> puneet: it jumps to the active class cause the mouseout event is triggered
[00:49:26] <Cork> its cause your dom structure leaks
[00:49:38] <Cork> make sure the parents always wrap the children
[00:50:00] <Cork> as in the layout parent, not the dom structure (it never leaks)
[00:52:06] <puneet> Cork : So what exactly should I do to get it works correctly?
[00:55:39] <Cork> puneet: you would have to inspect your parent dimentions and see why you drop out of ul when your still in the menu
[00:56:01] <Cork> and check what element you hover into instead
[00:57:56] <puneet> Cork: Thanks a lot its done
[00:58:44] <SkyHunter> Hi, i have a problem with a jquery ui dialog. the functions in the buttons i define get called as i open the dialog, so if i have a button with "alert('test')" it will show up when i start the dialog. and i cant reproduce it in jsfiddle :/
[00:59:06] <puneet> Actually you did .find('.active') but in place of that we have to write .find(".active a") thats it Cork
[01:00:43] <SkyHunter> Nevermind the Jquery-UI-1.9.1 was buggy
[01:00:53] <SkyHunter> updated to 1.9.2 and it works now
[01:12:03] <basiclaser> hey guys can you help me out with scaling issue
[01:13:24] <basiclaser> i want to make some text take up a lot of the width of the screen when the viewport is 'media', but only about 30% wide when it is on a desktop monitor
[01:13:58] <basiclaser> I tried using 20vw and max-width 400px, but it ignores the max-width attribute
[01:14:02] <basiclaser> what can i try?
[01:15:45] <raj> what's the best way to find an 'option' with a particular value?
[01:15:58] <raj> I'd prefer not using a [value=] type selector
[01:19:13] <Flam> basiclaser: look up media queries
[01:19:58] <basiclaser> thanks, i was hoping i didn't have to, i thought maybe you could set a relative value with a 'cap' on it
[01:20:16] <Flam> basiclaser: if your media queries dont work, its probably a css cascading issue, where a rule is being overwriting later on in the css (higher line number) or by something earlier on with more specific selectors or !important
[01:20:33] <basiclaser> ok thanks
[01:21:00] <Flam> basiclaser: oh. that may be a combination of media queries and something else then
[01:22:08] <basiclaser> whenever i introduce max-width, if the value is 1px or 1000px the element in question just goes nuts :P
[01:30:48] <Durga> hi
[01:32:27] <beachandbytes> hi
[01:32:46] <Cork> raj: its the only way
[01:33:05] <Durga> what are you all doing here ?
[01:35:00] <raj> oh ok
[01:35:01] <raj> thank you
[01:37:55] <Cork> raj: well except if you prefer to add classes to every option element, but that might be overkill
[01:38:28] <Cork> and if you select from the select parent, there won't be any measurable speed gain
[01:39:09] <peiper> hi, I'm doing an $('div.content').each-loop to cycle through my content divs, now I need the value of the first h3 inside the first span inside the div. $(this).find doesn't return the right element ;/
[01:43:59] <sacho> test case?
[01:44:26] <sahbeewah> peiper, you're better off giving some sort of class identifier to the said elements
[01:45:33] <Cork> peiper: $(this).find('span h3).first() should give you the right element
[01:46:02] <Cork> though is h3's allowed in spans...
[01:47:23] <peiper> sahbeewah, i can't, content is generated by CMS
[01:47:53] <peiper> Cork, thanks i'll try that
[01:48:03] <Cork> peiper:  Element h3 not allowed as child of element span in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.) <--
[01:48:10] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffiddle.jshell.net%2FFEKSR%2Fshow%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[01:48:19] <Cork> so thats why you can't select it; its not valid
[01:48:34] <peiper> well h3 inside span was just an example :P
[01:48:36] <Cork> the h3 will most likely be put after the span
[01:48:55] <Cork> peiper: then make sure to give a valid example
[01:49:01] <peiper> reality looks like this: div.content table tbody tr td h3
[01:49:01] <Cork> cause the dom will move things around if its not valid
[01:49:14] <Cork> ah, thats another matter
[01:49:42] <peiper> it's a bit tricky since i can't apply any classes, id's or other attributes such as data-attributes
[01:50:17] <Cork> not really just build it on the occurrence of the element
[01:56:11] <sahbeewah> peiper_, paste some code
[01:56:49] <peiper_> Cork, sahbeewah NVM i fucked up the HTML ... :/ sry guys ^^
[01:56:53] <peiper_> working now
[01:57:51] <Cork> peiper_: ya, always start by verifying your html validity
[01:58:05] <aaairc> I went to trigger a function anytime a class is added or removed from a div
[01:58:22] <aaairc> is that possible to have a listener on the div that listens for when a class is added or removed?
[01:58:27] <Cork> no
[01:58:45] <Cork> use a function to set the class, and trigger the actions from there
[02:07:46] <negev> hi, is there a way to bind a click event and then have some code that always executes before the click event handler?  without creating custom events or firing the callback manually in every handler.. i just want to click() and have it automatically execute the code every time
[02:08:33] <rakl> is `setTimeout(5000);` not correct syntax? i want to wait 5 secs before running the next line of code
[02:12:01] <Ov3rTaf> ne1 ever used jquery UI Layout there ? :)
[02:12:43] <beachandbytes> nope can't say i have

My problem is when i click rapidly on the navigation everything becomes buggy, check it out here please: http://jsfiddle.net/rncjK/15/
[02:42:25] <nuevallorker> Rajni i think what you need to do is unbind the click event until the current animation is finished

[02:44:15] <Rajni> looking at my code where should i put the unbind and bind? shall it be at begining and end of the function?

[03:06:00] <gates> Using jQM- What would be the solution to using a Facebook Dialog and giving it the ability to show up on the correct page?
[03:06:12] <gates> currently a popup only happens on the page that init the fb javascript sdk
[03:06:25] <gates> so if i ajax change pages the popup is now on the hidden page
[03:06:30] <gates> and if you go back you can find it
[03:11:21] <fALSO> hy there
[03:11:39] <fALSO> if i wanted to match all the id's that "contain" the word "material_id"
[03:11:51] <fALSO> how can i do that kind of selector ?
[03:13:42] <fALSO> for example id="material_apoio-1-material_id-1"
[03:13:45] <beachandbytes> $('[id~="material_id"]')
[03:13:45] <fALSO> that would match
[03:13:56] <fALSO> thank you so much beachandbytes
[03:14:11] <beachandbytes> np
[03:14:30] <johanhar> $("#form").submit() does not submit my form (yes I have the right selector) ... What can be wrong? I have looked for any submit handlers, didn't find any.
[03:14:56] <johanhar> Is it the submit button I need to submit? Not the form?
[03:15:05] <beachandbytes> can you post code
[03:15:09] <johanhar> Sure
[03:15:23] <johanhar> Well, I did...
[03:15:32] <johanhar> $("#form").submit()
[03:15:41] <beachandbytes> you don't even need a submit button
[03:15:55] <johanhar> #form is the ID of <form>
[03:16:08] <beachandbytes> form is the id you mean?
[03:16:13] <johanhar> yes
[03:16:17] <beachandbytes> <form id="form">?
[03:16:20] <johanhar> yes
[03:16:25] <sacho> test case please
[03:16:41] <sacho> perhaps your form doesn't have a submit action
[03:16:42] <beachandbytes> ya your doing it correct so we will need more context to see the problem
[03:16:55] <johanhar> ok, thanks, I'll look more into it
[03:19:22] <fALSO> beachandbytes,  that doesnt work
[03:19:28] <fALSO> doesnt match

[03:38:27] <FernandoBasso> I added a new picture in a page that uses the colorbox plugin, and now the pictures open at the very bottom of the page. Any help would be appreciated. http://www.osbombachudos.com.br/?action=abanda
[03:39:55] <AdamPDotty> hmm, colorbox has top:593px;
[03:39:56] <FernandoBasso> The script is placing a "top: 1643px" inline. That is what is causing the problem.
[03:40:05] <FernandoBasso> AdamPDotty: Click on the last one, please.
[03:41:15] <AdamPDotty> I dont know, where it comes from, but sounds like you dont want that top-setting
[03:41:41] <FernandoBasso> yeah, but since colorbox does that by itself, and _inline_, I don't know how to override it.
[03:43:22] <AdamPDotty> does not provide any callback or such?
[03:43:31] <FernandoBasso> $(".example16").colorbox({width:"850px", top: '10%', inline:true, href:"#inline_example16"});
[03:43:44] <FernandoBasso> We can pass that top: "x%" value.
[03:45:04] <FernandoBasso> AdamPDotty: Thanks for helping me out.
[03:45:09] <AdamPDotty> :-)
[03:45:21] <nuevallorker> what are the perfomance implications of node caching var $this = $(this) if i have a .each loop that takes the values of 5 different subnodes of $(this) ?
[03:47:32] <nuevallorker> does jqeury parse the whole DOM once it enters the .each loop? or does it start at the context node always and go downwards?
[03:48:09] <AdamPDotty> it has saved the nodes (set) before
[03:48:23] <AdamPDotty> and just goes through them
[03:49:01] <nuevallorker> so caching doesnt really make a big difference then?
[03:49:15] <AdamPDotty> probably not, but I am not a performance expert
[03:52:55] <raj> if I do $('input').attr('checked', true), will that trigger $('input').on('change')?
[03:53:15] <raj> even though it's being checked programmatically?
[03:53:37] <AdamPDotty> attr does change the markup
[03:53:50] <raj> will it trigger .on('change')?
[03:53:50] <AdamPDotty> prop does change the status
[03:53:59] <AdamPDotty> not sure, I would expect no
[03:54:29] <AdamPDotty> so: it should not
[03:55:47] <raj> it should not because you expect no?
[03:56:08] <AdamPDotty> because it changes the markup
[03:56:15] <AdamPDotty> and the markup is only parsed once
[03:58:22] <beachandbytes> i dont believe it would fire
[03:58:42] <beachandbytes> you could do $('input').attr('checked',true).change()
[03:58:59] <raj> I don't want it to fire
[03:59:14] <raj> but it seems to be
[04:00:06] <Cork> beachandbytes: don't use true and attr
[04:00:11] <Cork> its prop if for checked
[04:00:23] <Cork> attr('checked'
[04:00:25] <Cork> opps
[04:00:26] <beachandbytes> Cork I just c/p his code :)
[04:00:44] <Cork> its attr('checked', 'checked') / removeAttr('checked')
[04:00:53] <raj> kk, thank you
[04:00:59] <Cork> or prop('checked', true) / prop('checked', false)
[04:01:06] <Cork> (recommended)
[04:01:42] <Cork> beachandbytes: well you can tell them not to do it that way if you see it :)
[04:02:07] <beachandbytes> it still works though right?
[04:02:27] <Cork> attr for those cases are buggy
[04:02:37] <Cork> as it actually sets the attribute instead of the property
[04:02:47] <Cork> ex. ie doesn't trigger on that
[04:03:20] <raj> k
[04:03:21] <Cork> and older firefox doesn't do it either if i remember correctly
[04:03:26] <raj> so weird stuff is going on for that reason perhaps
[04:03:35] <Cork> (i think it was added back in ff2.5 or 3)
[04:03:41] <raj> will .prop('checked',true) trigger .on('change')?
[04:03:46] <Cork> no
[04:03:49] <raj> k, good
[04:03:55] <Cork> change is only triggered by user actions
[04:04:08] <Cork> or rather events are only triggered by user actions
[04:04:12] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/PkEbs/2/
[04:04:13] <raj> lovely, switching attr to prop fixed everything
[04:04:14] <Cork> or simulated events
[04:04:16] <beachandbytes> i don't see any difference Cork
[04:05:03] <Cork> beachandbytes: it depends on the browser
[04:05:23] <Cork> but the simple rule of thumb is if you want to change a state use prop
[04:05:50] <Cork> prop is what the browser modifies, and attr is what was originally on the html element
[04:07:29] <beachandbytes> i will remember that, seems to work at least on everything down to ie9
[04:07:45] <beachandbytes> don't have ie8 to test it
[04:13:18] <peiper> Can someone take a look on this here? http://jsfiddle.net/RM5P5/1/
[04:14:22] <BoF> peder: what you need?
[04:14:47] <BoF> peiper: what you need?
[04:15:52] <_|Nix|_> gates: You can put a popup outside of a page, but then you must enhance it yourself, and you cannot have other jQM widgets inside it which rely on a page (such as a listview): http://jsbin.com/onibuc/299
[04:18:39] <peiper> BoF, check the fiddle theres a comment
[04:20:48] <gates> _|Nix|_: i found a "popup" dialog type on facebook which does exactly that
[04:21:31] <gates> _|Nix|_: I am also using facebook canvas and trying to set the height using either FB.Canvas.setSize / FB.Canvas.autoGrow but it seems the page just grows crazy tall
[04:23:01] <gates> traditionally I the javascript would init every page load and now its only on first load
[04:23:14] <gates> so i cannot call a size change each time the page loads
[04:28:12] <gates> _|Nix|_: maybe I am trying to run it too early ebcause if i bind it to an onclick it works fine
[04:28:16] <gates> but i cannot use on page show
[04:28:26] <gates> without getting an undefined
[04:37:02] <quazimodo> hay hay
[04:38:17] <stabb> yo quas
[04:38:22] <quazimodo> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9f169326b731797e6456
[04:38:59] <quazimodo> so this ajax call is made, the data is arriving correctly, yet my little template seems to think that o.files is empty
[04:39:45] <quazimodo> I don't know how to a) access the json stuff that just arrived, b) locate where in the document o.files is, and c) how to get the json stuff into o.files
[04:39:48] <quazimodo> any idea?
[04:43:00] <FernandoBasso>                         var result = jQuery.parseJSON(return_data);
[04:44:14] <quazimodo> ahh it's starting to make more sense tome now
[04:47:42] <FernandoBasso> I know you can, with php for instance, echo json_encode(array('msg' => $msg, 'indicador_fone' => '', 'indicador_id' => '')); and then the javascript 'result' variable will be an array that you can access something like result.msg, result.indicador_id, etc.
[04:48:55] <Cork> quazimodo: is your server setting the correct mimetype for your json response?
[04:49:14] <Cork> that might be why you get the problem, json should always have the application/json mimetype
[04:52:21] <quazimodo> 'Content-Typeapplication/json; charset=utf-8' in the response header
[04:52:25] <quazimodo> yes?
[04:54:15] <jantje_> Hi
[04:54:47] <betamarine> hi jantje_
[04:55:08] <Cork> quazimodo: yes
[04:55:22] <jantje_> I'm using the autocomplete ui. Is it possible to cancel/ignore any pending $.getJSON requests on a keypress ?
[04:56:17] <jantje_> what sometimes happens is that a user types in some text, the auto complete jumps in, the user types some more text, quickly enters tab and submits the form. Then mostly the first autocomplete option is selected and the latest user input is discarded
[04:56:35] <quazimodo> Cork: out of ideas?
[04:57:08] <Cork> quazimodo: console.log(result) (or what ever your variable is called)
[04:57:18] <quazimodo> k
[04:57:25] <Cork> then inspect the structure of whats in there
[04:57:48] <quazimodo> ok so the result is absolutely fine :)
[04:58:51] <Cork> quazimodo: and its an object and not a string?
[04:59:15] <Cork> 2. and it has the structure you expected? (not objects in an array for example)
[05:00:29] <Cork> jantje_: it doesn't do that by default?
[05:01:04] <quazimodo> Cork: it's meant to be objects in an array I think
[05:01:50] <quazimodo> ok I'm gonna keep digging :)
[05:01:54] <quazimodo> sooner or later I'll get it XD
[05:02:15] <Cork> quazimodo: start by checking that the structure is what fileupload expects
[05:02:32] <Cork> sounds like thats where it borks for you
[05:03:13] <quazimodo> Cork: the file structure looks fine to me
[05:07:44] <quazimodo> is there a way to do console.log(...)  on a variable such that it will log the variables scope, like document.foo.bar.variable
[05:08:56] <sacho> no
[05:11:06] <Ekaitz> Hi all!
[05:11:12] <Ekaitz> I have the next problem : Anybody know what is this problem http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php/topic/40825-cjuisliderinput-too-slow-and-slide-event-is-not-triggering/
[05:11:26] <Ekaitz> I have asked in the #yii channel but I think is jquery problem
[05:11:47] <Ekaitz> anybody that can help me?
[05:12:51] <sacho> provide a test case please
[05:15:27] <Ekaitz> I will try sacho
[05:18:27] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys. Do you know of any plugins for jQuery where I can zoom (with pinch) and pan an image around in a container? like when viewing a picture on the iPhone/iPad. There is of course http://www.consulenza-web.com/jquery/touchpanview/ , but that doesn't work very well
[05:18:42] <jaffipaffi> It only needs to be compatible with iPad, as it's a Phonegap/webapp I'm developing for iPad
[05:19:00] <bau> I have a problem with jquery & firefox, in chrome it works perfect, but not in firefox, I have this error in the console with firebug: ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined why? I'm using cakephp which is a php framework
[05:19:40] <sacho> hard to know without seeing the code that is causing it.
[05:19:47] <jantje_>  Cork :no, if you're fast enough it will select the first item from the previous match
[05:20:16] <jantje_> Cork: the summary is that it's still processing request even if the user has typed anything new
[05:20:58] <jantje_> *the pending request
[05:21:48] <bau> sacho, http://pastebin.com/WQtHxCz5 I have error in line 33
[05:23:50] <Ekaitz> sacho how I can do a test case?
[05:24:38] <sacho> <ecmabot> A pared-down test case has the absolute minimum HTML, CSS, and JS needed to reproduce a problem. If you can delete any HTML, CSS, or JS and the problem still remains, you haven't pared it down fully. For best results, put your test case on http://jsfiddle.net and give us the URL.
[05:25:20] <jantje_> Cork: for example, assume you type 'te' and the query returns test/test1/test2/test3 , then you type 9 (so that it becomes test3) and a new query is sent to the server. If you press enter/tab/whatever BEFORE the result is returned then test9 gets changed to 'test' (because that was the first 'match')
[05:26:15] <Ekaitz> Sacho: the problem is that my bug it is only reproduce in my web site but not outside of enviroment website. I don't know how to reproduce in http://jsfiddle.net
[05:26:36] <Ekaitz> Sorry for my stupid questions I am ver new developing with Yii framework and Jquery
[05:27:03] <jantje_> (so that it becomes 'test9' I meant)
[05:27:32] <jantje_> so on a keypress I want to cancel all pending queries
[05:30:23] <Trudko> Guys hi, simple code I create div and add it to already existing div. For whatever reason right after I append it  I cant find using id selector whats wrong?  http://jsbin.com/amobod/1/edit
[05:31:14] <pachet> Trudko: you dont close the quote around that id attribute, for one
[05:32:10] <Trudko> heh ok
[05:42:54] <Nancy2012> is it possible to pass productId from img tag???
[05:48:54] <coachz> hi
[05:49:46] <coachz> How can I submit a form POST and go to a new page at the same time like a normal form submit does please ?  This is a login page and on submit I need it to go to a new page and pass the post vars.
[05:50:19] <coachz> not a new window though, just a redirect
[05:50:43] <pachet> why would you need jquery for that :[
[05:50:49] <Kasimir> ^
[05:51:06] <coachz> because i'm intercepting the submit to show a jquery dialog
[05:51:20] <coachz> an Agree to Terms dialog
[05:51:30] <pachet> are you changing the content of the form?
[05:51:35] <coachz> no
[05:51:37] <Kasimir> but surely you using an other language aswell
[05:51:42] <pachet> then just form.submit()
[05:51:50] <coachz> ahhhh
[05:51:52] <pachet> in your 'Accept Terms' click handler or wherever
[05:51:55] <coachz> sweet
[05:52:00] <coachz> trying now,  thanks !
[05:54:34] <coachz> pachet, like this ?  http://fpaste.org/bh5I/
[05:54:59] <coachz> it's redirecting before i click OK
[05:56:07] <coachz> i think i need it to be modal
[05:56:22] <coachz> hmm it is
[05:57:00] <coachz> this is how my dialog is defined also.  http://fpaste.org/KAUg/
[05:57:22] <coachz> ahh i think i got it
[05:58:20] <coachz> yay, thanks pachet
[05:59:36] <pachet> coachz: yeah just throw the form.submit() in the buttons.Ok handler
[06:09:08] <Nebros> i have a formular with option list. i can now double click on a listet option and it send the form, or i choose one and send with send button. what i have to do when i will send a choosen one with "enter"?
[06:11:06] <pachet> $(whatever).on('keydown.mynamespace', function(e){if ( e.which === 13 ) form.submit();});;
[06:11:14] <pachet> s/;;/;/
[06:11:59] <Nebros> hmm
[06:15:12] <Nebros> pachet: whatever = the name of form?
[06:15:30] <pachet> probably document, to be safe
[06:15:52] <pachet> or form, i dunno
[06:15:54] <pachet> i mean
[06:15:59] <pachet> if a form element has focus
[06:16:05] <pachet> binding to form makes the most sense
[06:16:09] <pachet> i dont know the particulars of your use case
[06:16:27] <Nebros> and what means e.wich === 13?
[06:16:46] <pachet> e.which is the normalized event property combining event.keyCode and event.charCode
[06:16:58] <pachet> which are normally mutually exclusive
[06:17:04] <pachet> 13 is the keycode for {enter}
[06:17:14] <Nebros> aha, ok :)
[06:17:15] <Cork> Nebros: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/event.which
[06:17:17] <Nebros> ill try it
[06:17:45] <Cork> also if your using jquery-ui it has some nice constants you can use
[06:18:10] <Cork> $.ui.keyCode.ENTER
[06:20:35] <Nebros> i have a jquery-latest in use, if you mean this.
[06:23:04] <aoeu256> I am having no success dynamically generating the navigation bar so that it isn't redrawn everytime the page is changed, anybody did it succesfully?
[06:32:39] <Nebros> pachet: it want work, your code will be free from errors, but my brain istnt. :P
[06:43:16] <lotjuh> Can someone tell me how I can convert the old metadata plugin way of giving options to the ui buttons to the new jquery ui 1.9 way?
[06:43:21] <lotjuh> I used to have: class="{button:{icons:{primary:'ui-icon-arrowreturnthick-1-w'}, text:false}}"
[06:43:31] <lotjuh> but I can't find any example of how to do it now
[06:50:46] <Ekaitz> Hi all it is possibly to change Mouse interaction options in Jquery ui from slider constructor?
[06:50:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, got some jquery code on a page, some of values in the code are dynamically generated with PHP. It works fine if the jquery code is in the page itself... but what if you want to put the jquery code in an external JS file, where no PHP is possible?
[06:51:37] <jiko> doesn't matter. the php always loads first
[06:51:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jiko: but it's a JS file
[06:52:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can't put PHP in there?
[06:52:09] <jiko> why is there php in a javascript file?
[06:52:18] <jiko> they shouldn't be together at all
[06:52:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> there is no php in there, that's the point
[06:52:28] <aoeu256> hmm has anyone here succesfully monetized their web application?
[06:52:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can you read my question again?
[06:52:37] <jiko> well javascript never sees any php ever
[06:52:46] <jiko> once it hits the browser it's HTML
[06:52:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> of course it does, like here: 'formData'      : 	{
[06:52:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 															   'timestamp' 		: '<?php echo $timestamp; ?>',
[06:52:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 															   'token'     		: '<?php echo md5('unique_salt' . $timestamp); ?>',
[06:52:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 															   'contestid'		: '<?php echo $contest->ID; ?>',
[06:52:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 															   'imgid'			: imgid,
[06:52:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 															   'uploadfoldersbs': uploadfoldersbs
[06:52:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 															},
[06:52:59] <jiko> and javascript/jquery runs on the html..
[06:53:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> some variables are dynamic
[06:53:20] <jiko> so generate those variable with javascript instead
[06:53:23] <jiko> of use $.ajax
[06:53:26] <jiko> or*
[06:53:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but they are GET values
[06:53:50] <jiko> ...and?
[06:53:53] <ryanneufeld> ecky--ptang-zoob: in the future please use a ?paste
[06:53:58] <jiko> use $.getJSON
[06:53:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sorry
[06:54:08] <ryanneufeld> ecky--ptang-zoob: see ?paste
[06:54:12] <jiko> and ping a server with PHP
[06:54:15] <ryanneufeld> ?paste @ecky--ptang-zoob
[06:54:31] <jiko> output the variables you need like timestamp, token, contestid etc
[06:54:32] <ryanneufeld> dammit b-ot
[06:54:36] <pachet> bot-t is out, per usual
[06:54:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok gotcha
[06:54:41] <pachet> probably vacationing in majorca
[06:54:45] <ryanneufeld> `paste
[06:54:52] <ryanneufeld> `p
[06:55:01] <jiko> lol bots are so lazy
[06:55:04] <ryanneufeld> b-ot: paste?
[06:55:07] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: better not tell you now.
[06:55:12] <pachet> lol
[06:55:14] <lotjuh> ok, so it turns out that the _getCreateOptions function is not implemented yet for ui.button while the metadata plugin functionality is already deprecated, what's the idea behind that?
[06:55:15] <ryanneufeld> of course... smart ass bot
[06:55:33] <amirite> poo?
[06:56:13] <amirite> poooo?
[06:56:26] <lotjuh> yeah, sounds like poo to me
[06:56:43] <amirite> i don't like camel case
[06:56:47] <amirite> it's naughty
[06:57:05] <jiko> whyNot?
[06:57:10] <liotur> Hello. I'm trying to make a button that will copy a div to clipboard. Ive tried ZeroClipboard and and zClip and i see that those work only with older versions of Firefox/ IE
[06:57:22] <jiko> liotur you should write that in camel case
[06:58:25] <amirite> because constructs likeIIsAApp are difficult
[07:01:21] <jiko> i don't see anything wrong there. camel case for brakfast
[07:01:25] <jiko> breakfast*
[07:01:55] <lotjuh> Seems like this is what I've been looking for: https://github.com/sash/jqueryui-init
[07:05:54] <liotur> jiko: HelloI\'mTryingToMakeAButtonThatWillCopyADivToClipboard\.IveTriedZeroClipboard(And|And)zClipAndISeeThatThoseWorkOnlyWithOlderVersionsOfFirefox\/IE << Any clues now?
[07:07:36] <paxcoder> Any reason why applying a datepicker as so: $('#element').datepicker($.datepicker.regional["hr"]); would fail to apply the specified language?
[07:08:56] <paxcoder> hmm $.datepicker.regional["hr"] seems to be undefined
[07:11:10] <eni> hi what's the name of jquery plugin that lets you search in a form and it displays the result as a list directly (live)?
[07:11:16] <eni> i've seen this but can't recall it's name.
[07:12:18] <anli> Is checked="foo", where foo is any string the same as checking a checkbox?
[07:12:43] <anli> Why did I not test this, forgive me
[07:13:09] <Ekaitz> hi all, it is possible that my jqueryui slider is very slow because it has a strange value in the delay 'mouse interaction'
[07:13:33] <Ekaitz> I have  tried out to put different delay values but I can't fix
[07:13:42] <paxcoder> nvm, i didn't have localization included
[07:14:14] <paxcoder> Am i getting through though? I've been ignored yesterday as well
[07:15:22] <paxcoder> o.O
[07:15:22] <Nebros> i can do what i want, this keydown... will not work -.-
[07:18:51] <quazimodo> could a missing set-cookie: header variable cause my ajax based code to fail?
[07:19:01] <quazimodo> is it something that's very important?
[07:19:38] <quazimodo> i guess that's a silly question huh
[07:20:03] <liotur> so anyone? any idea for copy to clipboard action
[07:20:04] <liotur> ?
[07:29:13] <quazimodo> wow I'm so stuck :/
[07:29:53] <BTC2510> hello all
[07:29:59] <BTC2510> hows going
[07:31:54] <BillCriswell> liotur: Google at all?
[07:34:11] <jedimind> liotur, copy to clipboardd is notoriously difficult to do cross platform/browser
[07:34:26] <jedimind> which is why the most common method, still, is to use flash
[07:34:28] <jedimind> sadly
[07:34:35] <jiko> liotur: sorry i had a meeting. sent you a message. you'll have to use flash for non-IE browsers
[07:34:39] <jedimind> there are a few polyfills that let you do it as jquery/flash plugins that make it pretty seamless to integrate
[07:35:23] <jiko> paxcoder: is there a localization file you're not including?
[07:35:58] <paxcoder> jiko, yep
[07:36:25] <jiko> should probably include that ;)
[07:37:49] <jedimind> pshh, details.
[07:39:39] <jiko> here ya go: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/494958/how-do-i-localize-the-jquery-datepicker
[07:40:23] <Nebros> pachet: can you please tell we why your codeline   $(myform).on('keydown.mynamespace', function(e){if ( e.which === 13 ) form.submit();});   will not work for me? :(
[07:41:29] <pachet> var $form = $('#id_for_form'); form.on('keydown.whatever', function(e){if ( e.which === 13 ) form.submit();});
[07:42:11] * pachet wonders how many scripts out there have 'mynamespace' in them, thanks to him using that in his examples
[07:43:05] * jiko checks the department of made of facts
[07:43:15] <jiko> 78%
[07:43:39] <liotur> Okay guys, BillCriswell Been there, done that. jedimind, I can see that :P im going to give zClip and ZeroClipboard another shot and jiko thanks i hopt your meeting went well :)
[07:43:41] <jiko> made up facts*
[07:47:07] <j105rob> seems like $(":input") doesn't pick up elements on google sites if the input type is set to something other than "text". in the case I am testing, the type is set to "email" thoughts?
[07:47:27] <j105rob> or rather pls enlighten me :)
[07:48:25] <jonkristian_wrk> Hi, I want to add keyboard navigation to galleryview https://github.com/jackwanders/GalleryView/blob/master/js/jquery.galleryview-3.0-dev.js , Can anyone give some pointers. I tried to add some code to call the showNext() function but it's all a little above my head: http://pastie.org/6354857
[07:49:30] <daum> can anyone tell me why http://jsfiddle.net/8LCHj/1/ doesn't work?  Its pretty much the direct doc from http://api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/
[07:49:58] <Nebros> pachet i dont know for what mynamespace is, thats why i do not change it...
[07:50:01] <daum> nvm just figured out data psueo selector is only in ui
[07:50:07] <NoiseEee> j105rob: i'd use a way more performant selector.  $('input,select,textarea,button')
[07:51:29] <j105rob> NoiseEee: AH! thx! will try
[07:52:40] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i'd like to catch the enter key on a single textfield. I want to preserve the form's native response by submitting, except when a certain input[text] is in focus. would I bind to the element?
[07:55:29] <jrockjiggz> nm, it does work
[07:56:41] <tongcx> hi guys, i want to do a validation of hash by event handler
[07:56:47] <tongcx> if the hash is not valid, i will correct it
[07:56:58] <tongcx> but then it will lead to a infinite event loop
[07:57:02] <tongcx> how could i stop this?
[07:57:30] <tongcx> basically, i want to do a hash change without triggering the event
[07:58:33] <bnason> Is there a way to use the connected sortable, but without actually being sortable? I want the user to be able to drag and drop between 2 lists. Should I just use draggable and droppable or hook into sortable and sort after dropping?
[07:58:39] <jiko> j105rob: you could also use $("form *")
[07:59:22] <j105rob> jiko: not sure that google is using forms anymore, mostly ajax and comet for comms
[07:59:35] <j105rob> but thx for the idea!
[07:59:49] <jiko> well you can also use attribute selectors input[type=*]
[08:03:26] <tongcx> anyone know how do handle my question, change hash in hashchange event handler?
[08:06:55] <quazimodo> ha anyone here got experience with jquery-file-upload
[08:07:19] <jiko> j105rob: oops it's actually $('input[type]')
[08:07:39] <jiko> http://jsfiddle.net/nabSt/
[08:08:41] <j105rob> jiko: thx!
[08:09:24] <daum> does the jquery data selector attribute only work on ones where jquery set the 'data' attribute?  http://jsfiddle.net/8LCHj/9/ would make it seem so?
[08:11:10] <jiko> daum: i always use $(elem).attr('data-field')
[08:15:33] <khurram> hi every one
[08:17:52] <quazimodo> :(
[08:19:10] <Mottie2> daum: there is no :data() selector
[08:19:20] <Mottie2> : data()
[08:19:57] <Mottie2> daum: use $('[data-color]') instead
[08:20:20] <daum> yep i ended up doing that
[08:21:57] <jiko> yeah i just made a fiddle with that lol
[08:22:01] <khurram> any one used isotope here ?
[08:22:13] <khurram> i have a tiny problem with layout and reLayout
[08:38:24] <khurram> can some one please help me with isotope plugin ?
[08:38:56] <khurram> my isotope after mouse out put the scroll bar on the BOX how can i fix this mouse out without scroll bar ?
[08:41:25] <tongcx> hi guys, is there any difference between hashchange and onhashchange events?
[08:44:45] <schofld> what does "an object with a single key" look like in abject literals
[08:44:54] <schofld> {key1: "text1", key2: "text2"} ?? or is this a single object with two keys
[08:52:27] <BillCriswell> schofld: That's an object with two keys.
[08:56:54] <rabx> So I found a css3 animation library but there are some issues with it mainly with the animation stopping (a jerky default back to the original state) if the user hovers off the object before the animation finishes. I was hoping to use mouseEnter to resolve this issue. Or, if anyone knows of a jquery animation plugin (asides from jquery ui) that would be helpful as well
[09:00:41] <drvanon> Can I ask questions about jquery mobile here?
[09:01:11] <Brodingo> yup
[09:02:05] <drvanon> Awesome! Ehm I am making this little app-like site to fetch timetables it's on python anywhere: http://drvanon.pythonanywhere.com/
[09:02:57] <drvanon> And I have this little problem: I don't recieve any information, not via alerts (might be logical for mobile) but also not via console.log
[09:03:16] <drvanon> Why does it not do that?
[09:03:34] <drvanon> I kinda explicitly tell it to
[09:03:39] <schofld> BillCriswell: Thanks i thought so
[09:03:59] <drvanon> line 26, and 31

[09:10:40] <boytoy> hey, ive juset set up this breakpoint on this complex script in chrome web inspector - is there a way to export the scope variables into a textfile? the information that came outta this breakpoint thing is massive and id rather not have to select all the text paste it, and manually indent hundreds of lines to send to my developer friend
[09:13:16] <rabx> can someone recommend an animation plugin besides jquery ui? I am looking for cheesy image animations
[09:16:38] <ahmadalli> no idea?!?
[09:18:41] <rabx> Know of a jquery plugin that can do a few of these animations? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/css3-animations-plugin/launch
[09:19:24] <acidjazz> yes rabx
[09:19:28] <acidjazz> its called your mom
[09:19:32] <acidjazz> your mother

[09:33:34] <inv3nt0r> Good afternoon everyone!
[09:33:45] <jedimind> calm down
[09:34:42] <inv3nt0r> Sorry about that, the exclamation point is a bit excessive I suppose...
[09:35:50] <inv3nt0r> Anyway I'm having a small issue with IE7/8
[09:36:46] <frb> Why was .toggle(function, function, ... ) removed in 1.9?
[09:36:53] <frb> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#toggle-function-function-removed
[09:37:32] <inv3nt0r> For some reason when I use window.onload = function() { jQuery("div.caroufredsel_wrapper").css({"height":tileWidth});  }  my page scrolls on its own...
[09:38:08] <inv3nt0r> When I scroll to the bottom of the page it snaps up all by itself. Any thoughts?
[09:39:03] <xiphiasx_> hi
[09:39:11] <xiphiasx_> so I have class "order_menu"
[09:40:00] <xiphiasx_> http://pastie.org/private/xzfirvvod0zjjytx7pvda
[09:40:02] <xiphiasx_> i never get alerted
[09:42:36] <grafi> works for me xiphiasx_
[09:43:13] <xiphiasx_> that bothers me.
[09:43:28] <grafi> jquery working properly?
[09:43:42] <xiphiasx_>  25         <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"></script>

[09:43:48] <xiphiasx_> that's in my HTML file
[09:43:53] <xiphiasx_> and it works it seems
[09:45:16] <grafi> strange
[09:45:35] <xiphiasx_> i'm going to upload the app to my phone now
[09:45:37] <xiphiasx_> i'll give it a shot there
[09:46:25] <xiphiasx_> nope
[09:46:25] <xiphiasx_> nothing
[09:47:11] <zfly9> hey guys I'm using this plugin http://www.designchemical.com/lab/jquery-vertical-accordion-menu-plugin/options/ for a jquery accordion fuctionality on a side menu so when you click a parent element the children show. I have grandchildren pages which I just want to show with it's parents, I don't want the user to have to click the accordion again on the parent elements to see them, how can I 'turn off' the plugin on the grandchildren pag
[09:47:45] <rocking777> hello room
[09:47:48] <xiphiasx_> grafi: what test case did you use?
[09:48:16] <grafi> i just created an a tag to click on
[09:48:29] <kas84> hi there
[09:48:52] <kas84> is there a different way to access the text entered in an input other than val();?
[09:49:18] <xiphiasx_> grafi: it's not working for me
[09:49:30] <kas84> when entered text on an input type="number" on Crhome, the value is an empty string but the text is not wiped
[09:49:55] <grafi> the problem doesnt seem to be the js
[09:49:55] <jrockjiggz> any ich users?
[09:50:02] <xiphiasx_> grafi: hold
[09:50:07] <jrockjiggz> i'm unable to get template to load
[09:50:35] <xiphiasx_> grafi: http://pastie.org/private/mwipfmtj8zcfktb0jhobzq
[09:53:04] <grafi> xiphiasx_ looks alright :|
[09:53:40] <xiphiasx_> i have no idea
[09:53:56] <xiphiasx_> i ran it through every validator i could think of
[09:54:00] <xiphiasx_> everything checks out
[09:54:02] <xiphiasx_> hell
[09:54:06] <xiphiasx_> it doesn't work on jsbin
[09:54:37] <grafi> the js file in the right location?
[09:54:48] <xiphiasx_> yep
[09:55:29] <grafi> hm
[09:56:41] <grafi> is the html static?
[09:56:47] <xiphiasx_> yep, it's all one html file
[09:57:00] <grafi> running out of ideas :P
[09:57:04] <xiphiasx_> i'm running out of time
[09:57:06] <xiphiasx_> this is a deadlined project
[09:57:07] <xiphiasx_> heh
[09:59:08] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/qaFkC/3/ xiphiasx_ works fine here
[09:59:43] <relipse> in php can you have a pdo object be a constant? like _PDO_->prepare()
[10:00:06] <grafi> maybe ask in #php relipse :P
[10:01:03] <amcsi_work> is it totally acceptable to add an element to a jquery object with jqObj.push(htmlEl)?
[10:01:27] <amcsi_work> I just have to make sure that what I pass is an actual, regular HTML Dom Element?
[10:01:39] <rickibalboa> xiphiasx_, you tried using something else instead of .click() like .on('click') or a higher delegated event? Maybe the event isn't firing at all for you for some reason. FYI that jsfiddle works for me too :/
[10:02:08] <amcsi_work> I want to avoid the overhead of creating newer and newer instances with .add(thisEl).add(thatEl).add(...
[10:03:18] <xiphiasx_> everything you see before you is what I have
[10:03:42] <rocking777> i have a slideshow with each slide containing an iframe.  only the first div is visible all others were hidden (display:none) on load. So they were not rednered at all.  Now on click, when i make a particular div visible by making display: block, the block is viible but iframe is not, because it is not rendering. When i resize my browser, then i see the iframe bcoz its getting rendered. How can i overcome this?
[10:03:45] <rickibalboa> Very odd, what platform you using? You tried outputting to console to make sure the event is firing
[10:04:00] <xiphiasx_> i'm using OS X/firefox
[10:04:06] <xiphiasx_> because for whatever reason chrome won't handle page changes
[10:04:24] <rickibalboa> won't handle page changes as in?
[10:04:44] <xiphiasx_> whenever I would click on something in the navbar on chrome
[10:04:46] <xiphiasx_> "Error Loading Page"
[10:04:49] <xiphiasx_> this does not happen with firefox
[10:05:04] <Progster> http://jsfiddle.net/j7G4Z/ - Why is the output row2? Shouldn't row1 be output since it is the context, and therefore only itself or its descendants should be output?
[10:05:35] <rickibalboa> Hmm.. Odd, probably not a client problem that though, could be something with your webserver.. Does the js fiddle posted work for you at all?
[10:05:48] <xiphiasx_> it works just fine
[10:05:58] <xiphiasx_> i'm not running it on any web server though
[10:06:05] <xiphiasx_> i'm just opening the files locally
[10:08:35] <xiphiasx_> i'm trying it on a different system now
[10:08:36] <xiphiasx_> hold
[10:08:46] <xiphiasx_> no effectr
[10:08:46] <grafi> ok xiphiasx_ locally it doesnt work for me either
[10:08:48] <xiphiasx_> *effect
[10:08:51] <frb> not having toggle() in jQ1.9 sucks :(
[10:08:51] <rickibalboa> Now see I've just recreated the page and it doesn't work for me either
[10:08:55] <frb> guess i'll stick with 1.8
[10:08:58] <xiphiasx_> hm
[10:09:00] <xiphiasx_> wonder what's going on
[10:09:08] <xiphiasx_> there's no reason it should be sporadically shitting out
[10:09:27] <Progster> http://jsfiddle.net/j7G4Z/ - Why is the output row2? Shouldn't row1 be output since it is the context, and therefore only itself or its descendants should be output?
[10:09:31] <xiphiasx_> it doesn't work on my phone either
[10:09:39] <rocking777> any idea how i can reload a particular div so that the content in that gets rendered
[10:09:43] <xiphiasx_> which is an actual app, done via Phonegap
[10:09:43] <nchapiro> hello!
[10:09:49] <asantos22> I can't seem to nail down how to serialize a sortable. Anyone mind taking a peek here and steering me in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/jyZpY/12/
[10:10:07] <rickibalboa> Ya, really odd. Seems the event isn't firing at all
[10:10:20] <xiphiasx_> curious
[10:10:37] <nchapiro> I need help, please someone who speaks Spanish ???
[10:11:20] <xiphiasx_> rickibalboa: i can forsee no complication as to why the event wouldn't fire locally
[10:11:29] <nchapiro> I have problems with built collapse
[10:11:34] <nchapiro> Please :)
[10:11:34] <rickibalboa> Me either. I feel like jquerymobile might be breaking it
[10:11:41] <xiphiasx_> let me test that
[10:12:09] <rickibalboa> Nah it isn't.. Hmm
[10:13:33] <xiphiasx_> i would suggest version incompatibility between jquery and jquery mobile
[10:13:43] <xiphiasx_> but if that were the case, jsfiddle wouldn't have worked
[10:13:49] <rickibalboa> Ya, true
[10:14:39] <rickibalboa> Oh, theres no document ready wrapper
[10:14:54] <xiphiasx_> you've got to be shitting me
[10:15:00] <grafi> hm
[10:15:06] <grafi> rickibalboa was quicker
[10:15:07] <grafi> :P
[10:15:13] <grafi> just realised that myself
[10:15:22] <grafi> anyways, fix that and its fine :P
[10:15:23] <nchapiro> I have problems with built collapse
[10:15:24] <xiphiasx_> i'm pretty new to jquery
[10:15:26] <xiphiasx_> so forgive me
[10:15:30] <Progster> i have a simple fiddle. can anyone please take a look at it?
[10:15:45] <rickibalboa> Ya, just tested it lol. I'm sitting there thinking why the fuck isn't this working, then I just look, no document ready wrapper. Yeah it's a mistake we all make at the start
[10:16:00] <xiphiasx_> $(document).ready
[10:16:00] <xiphiasx_> right?
[10:16:28] <grafi> $(function() { // your code here });
[10:16:31] <grafi> for short
[10:16:32] <rickibalboa> ya
[10:16:34] <xiphiasx_> oh dear.
[10:19:29] <xiphiasx_> works now
[10:22:19] <asantos22> Any idea why I'm getting an empty string with serialize in a sortable? I'm a beginner, so I'm sure it's pretty something egregious: http://jsfiddle.net/jyZpY/13/
[10:22:42] <derik> i have this .json http://openapi.ro/api/companies/992154.json with "state":"Bac\u0102U" , how i do when i add to browser to show corectly with diacritics. UTF-8 standard
[10:24:45] <BillCriswell> asantos22: http://jsfiddle.net/jyZpY/14/ probably what you're shooting for.
[10:25:43] <asantos22> BillCriswell: Aha! Thanks for your sharp eyes!

[10:37:21] <moscownights> geve all
[10:38:10] <moscownights> anyone got any tips on filtering out the differences out of a number of highly similar strings?
[10:38:23] <frb> moscownights: similar how
[10:38:28] <moscownights> the difference most of the times being 1/7
[10:39:00] <moscownights> yea, sorry, this must be confusing heh, ehm string are like foo.faaa.lalala
[10:39:30] <moscownights> but sometimes theyve got a suffix, denoting their number so, the foo.faaa.lalala part is always the same
[10:39:49] <moscownights> but some are foo.faaa.lalala <1/7>
[10:40:14] <moscownights> id like to filter out the parts of the string that makes them unique
[10:45:05] <moscownights> so, like this, is what i mean :d
[10:45:30] <tomasm-> hi, I seem to have jquery ui 1.8.14 or so, and I'm noticing with accordians that it looks horrendous, almost like the css is just broken.... the colors are awful, ie a tacky blue and purple for active/inactive.... the css file seems to be loading, it's just coded with awful colors... am I doing something wrong? or do I need to upgrade? I'm just worried about upgrading the UI code without requiring new jquery 1.9 that breaks a bunch o

[10:46:12] <tomasm-> and the arrows are overlapping with the headers.
[10:52:22] <zfly9> Can someone tell me how to disable sub submenus on jquery accordion plugin?
[10:52:32] <zfly9> I don't want the user to have to click the sub menu of a sub menu
[10:55:40] <samholmes> How do I get the stylesheet property of an element?
[10:56:02] <samholmes> That is, the styling of an element from a stylesheet, not the style attribute?
[10:56:47] <samholmes> $element.css('opacity') === .5; $element.css('opacity', 1); $element.css('opacity') === 1; // I want to get the .5
[10:58:36] <drvanon> would it be possible to make cross-domain requests with jquery even if I did not own the server I request to?
[10:59:26] <drvanon> It would be nice if it worked for jquery mobile
[10:59:42] <samholmes> Mah queschun?! o.O
[11:06:32] <rhelic> I have a <textarea> that I'm treating like a faux listbox... data is being entered in groups of 8, I'm trying to write some jQuery that automatically inserts a NEWLINE after the 8th char... the following code fires off but there's no newline  if ($('#txtContainerID').val().length === 8) { alert('at 8'); $('#txtContainerID').val() += '\n';}
[11:11:20] <jrockjiggz> rhelic: have you tried "\n" <-- double quotes
[11:18:38] <gnarf> you can't += a return value LHS, it doesn't set anything...
[11:19:08] <gnarf> $("#txtContainerID").val(function( index, val ) { return val + "\n"; })
[11:19:28] <gnarf> or better yet, don't chop up the list while people type, it will be very bad UX
[11:19:51] <gnarf> wait until they tab/stop typing and then run the whole thing through a regexp to format it
[11:21:36] <Progster> http://jsfiddle.net/j7G4Z/ - Why is the output row2? Shouldn't row1 be output since it is the context, and therefore only itself or its descendants should be output?
[11:26:34] <BillCriswell> I think it's only for it's descendants?
[11:26:40] <BillCriswell> Progster: ^
[11:27:03] <kracekumar> I am using http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#api ajaxForm, If i submit the form via web browser i get expected result(form is submitted and json response is rendered via html) but in mobile web browser plain json is displayed in browser, it fails to enter success code. https://github.com/hasgeek/hasgeek.tv/blob/master/hgtv/templates/video.html#L356
[11:32:18] <BillCriswell> kracekumar: Literally all mobile browsers or just a particular one?
[11:32:43] <kracekumar> I tried chrome, firefox both had same issue
[11:32:52] <kracekumar> BillCriswell, ^
[11:35:15] <BillCriswell> Hmm..
[11:35:45] <BillCriswell> Desktop Chrome it's all right, though?
[11:36:18] <kracekumar> Yes Desktop version works as expected.
[11:36:42] <kracekumar> only problem with mobile browser, wondering is it because of lack of e.preventDefault()
[11:38:44] <plipp> What is the proper way of asking the server if "new objects are available"?  Are there some callbacks that can be observed on, or do I need to poll?  And if so, are there any good conventions on it.. like "give me objects older than" or "give me ids > x"..  i.e. almost database-like queries..
[11:39:12] <BillCriswell> kracekumar: Is there a separate mobile site or something? Maybe the script just isn't being called propertly? Are you getting any errors?
[11:39:19] <culh> I need to retrieve a link someone pasted me a few days ago from channel logs. How can I do this?
[11:40:28] <BillCriswell> culh: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[11:40:34] <kracekumar> BillCriswell, no we don't have any mobile site. I am not getting any error message, viewing the network in chrome dev tool bar seems evrything is ok
[11:41:06] <culh> BillCriswell: can I query for my nick?
[11:41:31] <culh> That listing's gonna take too long I think
[11:42:38] <BillCriswell> culh: Not that I'm aware of.
[11:42:54] <culh> no problemo, got lucky. thanks
[11:43:15] <BillCriswell> kracekumar: Hmm.. What if you explicitly set dataType to json?
[11:43:57] <plipp> culh: When you are less lucky, just save the source and grep
[11:44:42] <kracekumar> return value type is application/json, BillCriswell in desktop version same value is fetched and packed.js is loaded which isn't loaded in mobile version, I am debugging using chrome dev toolbar
[11:48:34] <BillCriswell> kracekumar: Okie dokie.
[11:54:55] <zubelgenubi> Need some advice: I want to use ajax for a link that will increment a value on server and update the value on page if successful. Should I set up my server script to send json back, and then use $.getJSON?    Never done this before, is there a better way?    Thanks!
[11:59:29] <jiko> zubelgenubi: yeah use setInterval and $.getJSON
[12:00:11] <rebel_yell> hey im trying to get some data to work on ajax start
[12:00:14] <rebel_yell> here is my gist
[12:00:15] <rebel_yell> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5052147
[12:00:18] <rebel_yell> any suggestions?
[12:00:22] <jiko> wait you want to trigger with a link? you should use on click and $.ajax post
[12:01:06] <jiko> rebel_yell: you don't have a URL in your $.ajax
[12:01:47] <rebel_yell> i dont need a url
[12:01:50] <rebel_yell> it pops up a modal
[12:01:56] <rebel_yell> the function is what needs to be called
[12:02:02] <rebel_yell> but its not calling that function
[12:02:04] <jiko> then why are you using $.ajax at all?
[12:02:17] <rebel_yell> because the results of the page load through ajax
[12:02:24] <rebel_yell> after it goes through filters
[12:02:45] <zubelgenubi> ok jiko.  How can I make sure I don't increment the value on the client if there's an error on the server side?
[12:02:58] <jiko> zeubelgenubi use a callback
[12:03:04] <BillCriswell> zubelgenubi: That's the most direct approach I can think of.
[12:04:38] <rebel_yell> like
[12:04:50] <rebel_yell> so everytime ajax is succesfful i need it to update the function
[12:05:43] <jiko> success: function(){ //increment values and update display }
[12:05:59] <zubelgenubi> jiko: thanks are you talking about success: function() { } or something else?
[12:06:07] <jiko> ^ yup
[12:06:12] <zubelgenubi> ok
[12:06:16] <rebel_yell> $(document).ready(do_on_load)
[12:06:50] <k_89> $scope
[12:06:52] <k_89> ftw
[12:07:14] <k_89> angularjs .. takes care of boring bits of client side apps for you
[12:07:40] <rebel_yell> i can do it through that
[12:07:45] <rebel_yell> how would i write that in ajax
[12:08:42] <jiko> ....
[12:10:12] <rebel_yell> no answer?
[12:11:16] <Chuguniy> Hi. Is it possible to get only part of whole html document with $.ajax? http://jsbin.com/elocap/2/edit Now it returns whole document, but I need only a #editImageModalBox contents. Thanks.
[12:11:57] <Eviltwin> Doesn't work like that
[12:12:11] <Eviltwin> Are you sure you don't want this? http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:12:19] <BillCriswell> Chuguniy: .load sounds like what you want.
[12:12:21] <BillCriswell> Ah crap.
[12:12:23] <rebel_yell> so ajax successs(do_on_load)
[12:12:40] <Chuguniy> Well, it does not work with .load() also :/
[12:12:53] <jiko> it does ;)
[12:13:14] <Chuguniy> Hm... well, will try one more time...
[12:13:15] <BillCriswell> Chuguniy: Saying it "does not work" is waaaayyyy to broad of a problem.
[12:13:34] <Chuguniy> Will give an example
[12:13:53] <jiko> use $.load('article.html #target')
[12:14:45] <Chuguniy> http://jsbin.com/itukag/1/edit
[12:14:48] <BillCriswell> $('.load-content-here').load('article.html #content-to-load'); might be a little clearer.
[12:15:12] <jiko> i just copied the example from the api docs lol
[12:16:39] <billiam> I have a method returning a jquery promise. If I want to exit that method early (before the promise is created by an ajax call), what should I be returning? A new deferred, or is there something more self-documenting?
[12:17:00] <Chuguniy> The example I have posted is not working for me. The problem is I am on index.php page, pressing button, it sends POST data with variables and index.php changes, than I need to grab only part of index.php and reload the same element contents.
[12:17:38] <BillCris_> Sorry about that...
[12:18:34] <BillCriswell_> Chuguniy: Did you get my last message?
[12:18:48] <Chuguniy> With $.ajax it works fine, but I can't grab only part of whole page. But with .load() it does nnot work at all, it returns the same tha is on rendered page.
[12:19:12] <BillCriswell_> Did you see this? $('.load-content-here').load('article.html #content-to-load');
[12:20:05] <Chuguniy> BillCriswell_: Yes. Is it not the same http://jsbin.com/itukag/1/edit ?
[12:21:07] <Progster> BillCriswell_: It's not a descendant but a sibling
[12:21:11] <Progster> it makes absolutely no sense to me
[12:23:26] <Progster> here it is again with an explanation
[12:23:30] <Progster> http://jsfiddle.net/j7G4Z/ - Why is the output row2? Shouldn't row1 be output since it is the context, and therefore only itself or its descendants should be output?
[12:24:51] <BillCriswell_> Chuguniy: Try just $.load('index.php?imageId=5 #foo') and see if it works that way. I'm not sure the fragment part works when you pass more than one parameter.
[12:30:18] <jiko> the response might not be valid HTML
[12:30:27] <jiko> check firebug's response
[12:33:29] <ansimation> if i have a ul that has nested ul's (parent/child hierarchy) in it and I bind a background color change to the li's on hover, how can i target individual li's? if i'm hovering on a child li since it's still within the parent li both of them have the bg color changed. I dont want that. Hope that made sense?
[12:34:15] <djQuery> ansimation, set the background color on the ul,
[12:34:39] <ansimation> it's already set to white
[12:34:56] <djQuery>  li ul { background-color: white } ?
[12:35:10] <ansimation> http://97.97.254.70/hrharvard/areas-of-focus/arms-armed-conflict/
[12:35:13] <djQuery> `demo
[12:35:13] <b-ot> djQuery: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:35:48] <ansimation> click the little plus icon next to alien tort statute to show the child nav
[12:35:57] <BillCriswell_> ansimation: I think you want >.
[12:36:14] <ansimation> BillCriswell_, maybe, let me try
[12:36:52] <BillCriswell_> ansimation: So something like... .nav > ul > li {} would only get the first <li>s.
[12:38:50] <ansimation> tried this  $('.sidebar-left ul > li').not('.current').hover(function(){ .. but i still get the same thing
[12:39:07] <BillCriswell_> You need the > before ul
[12:39:15] <ansimation> ah ok
[12:39:54] <ansimation> oh almost! backwards now it just selects the parent item instead of the child, lol
[12:40:11] <djQuery> ansimation, also if you click a minus next to something that has no children any of the expanded collapses
[12:41:40] <BillCriswell_> $('li li') ?
[12:41:41] <ansimation> there shouldnt be a minus next to anything doesnt have children
[12:42:47] <ansimation> BillCriswell_, li li only works on the children
[12:43:19] <ansimation> wait nevermind. that was becauise of something else
[12:43:28] <BillCriswell_> Ok.
[12:43:52] <ansimation> .sidebar-left > ul > li li - that only does the children
[12:43:55] <ansimation> li > li does nothing
[12:45:01] <Chuguniy> BillCriswell_: $.load('index.php?imageId=5 #foo') Does not work either :/ but tnx.
[12:45:30] <BillCriswell_> Ok.
[12:48:36] <naeluh_> Hi  I have  a fiddle and I am trying to fadeIn other content on click and then return the original div state on the second click here is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/DsswZ/ its the scale button I can get it fadeIN() and fadeOut() on click I want it to basically go inreverse on the second click anywhere on the page thanks again

[12:54:44] <RandomCouch> Hello?
[12:54:58] <RandomCouch> I really need to figure something out please...
[12:55:15] <RandomCouch> Why was $.browser deprecated?! This made my website buggy
[12:55:34] <naeluh_> I used  $('body').click(function () {}); but once I click onto another shape target it seems to forget the function?
[12:55:37] <RandomCouch> Also, the migrate tool doesn't fix it
[12:58:13] <zfly9> Hey guys, I have a div that's only shown with the .hide .show functionality from a link above it.. Is there a way I can link to that hidden div from another page and have it open (or just be open when it gets there)?
[12:59:37] <RandomCouch> Hmmm
[12:59:55] <RandomCouch> Wish I could help but I'm not that experienced with JQuery
[13:00:05] <zfly9> linking to it using /#div-id
[13:00:09] <RandomCouch> Also, it seems like there are no "helpers" around
[13:01:34] <BillCriswell_> zfly9: You'd need to pass some kind of variable in the header or query string.
[13:02:02] <zfly9> BillCriswell_ would you mind explaining? trying to learn as I go
[13:02:08] <zfly9> if not, no worries..
[13:02:32] <BillCriswell_> Some kind of variable in the hash or query string*.
[13:03:33] <BillCriswell_> zfly9: You can adjust the hash depending on the state of the div and then when the page loads you just check that state variable to see what to do with it.
[13:04:03] <RandomCouch> I have a plugin conflicting with another plugin in my wordpress site, while I was searching for the source of this problem, everything lead me to the fact that $.browser has been deprecated in JQuery, is this a possibility? Or is this not the reason why I'm getting an error such as Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined in jquery.colorbox.min.js:1
[13:04:30] <zfly9> BillCriswell_ what you're saying makes sense, just not sure how to do it in my scenario, is there an example you know of that I can study?
[13:05:49] <zubelgenubi> sorry new to js - data: { value: incsecurity } value is key, incsecurity is a variable.  Help my syntax please!
[13:06:00] <BillCriswell_> zfly9: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3729150/retrieve-specific-hash-tags-value-from-url seems like it could be helfpul.
[13:06:29] <BillCriswell_> zubelgenubi: {data:{value:'insecurity'}} is what you'd like it to be probably.
[13:06:40] <BillCriswell_> data.value would return insecurity.
[13:06:52] <BillCriswell_> Ah sorry
[13:07:12] <BillCriswell_> You can just use {data:{value:insecurity }} and it should be just fine.
[13:07:15] <zubelgenubi> oh but incsecurity is a variable that has 2 in it
[13:08:04] <BillCriswell_> zubelgenubi: Not sure what that means.
[13:08:14] <zubelgenubi> var incsecurity = 2;
[13:08:15] <BillCriswell_> insecruity = 'some2thing'; ?
[13:08:33] <BillCriswell_> zubelgenubi: That's fine. data.value would return 2.
[13:08:43] <zubelgenubi> ok thx
[13:09:44] <RandomCouch> I'm gonna go ahead and assume that no one knew of the problem I was having
[13:09:48] <RandomCouch> since no one answered lol
[13:10:17] <BillCriswell_> RandomCouch: If you just use an older version of jQuery you should be ok. I do believe .browser is deprecated in the latest version.
[13:10:40] <abstortedminds> Anyone know why beforeClose() on Dialog is closing regardless of what I do?  http://pastebin.com/9mpRLXUt
[13:10:54] <BillCriswell_> RandomCouch: Yes, 1.9 does not have .browser
[13:10:56] <RandomCouch> BillCriswell_ The thing is, in my wordpress theme I'm trying to find where the <script> link to JQuery is... and I simply cannot find it
[13:11:05] <BillCriswell_> RandomCouch: Ah, no idea.
[13:11:44] <BillCriswell_> View Source > Control + F: "jquery" not helping anything?
[13:13:01] <zfly9> BillCriswell_ thanks I'll take a look
[13:13:15] <savid> Anyone know why, in IE8, $('#print_form input').val()  would return "undefined", while $('#print_form').find('input').val()  returns the actual value?
[13:13:55] <savid> In chrome, both of those return a value.
[13:13:59] <nebmo> hi, I have a function to check all form inputs are filled in on submit (http://jsfiddle.net/ypxPN/1/) how do i make the ".required" class on radio buttons?
[13:14:54] <BillCriswell_> savid: Sounds like the markup might be a little weird?
[13:14:56] <RandomCouch> BillCriswell_ Yes that finds it, but I can't find the file that links it.... maybe it's functions.js
[13:15:09] <BillCriswell_> RandomCouch: Not sure which does out of the box.
[13:15:11] <nebmo> sorry this is correct link: http://jsfiddle.net/ypxPN/2/
[13:15:51] <savid> BillCriswell_, the form is being generated using javascript
[13:16:58] <BillCriswell_> nebmo: There's so many form validation plugins out there. You might be better off just using one of those. If you definitely want to do your own you could do look into .split() and $.serialize().
[13:17:16] <BillCriswell_> Without a live example it would be hard to know for certain.
[13:17:23] <BillCriswell_> savid ^
[13:18:15] <RandomCouch> Ugh, it's a bit frustrating, why'd they have to take out $.browser ? was there a reason given for this
[13:20:02] <OKT> I'm trying to trigger a hide() call on a div once a button is clicked, it blinks like it's hiding, but shows right back up. Do I have to specify a duration for hide? Or can I make it hide until I teill it to show()?
[13:24:09] <aniasis> Which is faster... to calculate a point on a window and then append an element @ that point to the DOM 500 times or calculate 500 points, add to a list and then append to the DOM 500 times.
[13:24:21] <aniasis> using jQuery
[13:24:35] <Eviltwin> I have no idea what you mean
[13:24:39] <Eviltwin> There aren't "points" in the DOM
[13:24:49] <aniasis> left,top
[13:25:01] <Eviltwin> Those are CSS properties, not DOM properties
[13:25:02] <aniasis> lets assume left,top = point
[13:25:27] <aniasis> I know but I create and element with those CSS properties and append to the element to the DOM
[13:25:30] <Eviltwin> It's better to set the CSS on the element then add it to the DOM
[13:25:55] <aniasis> sure
[13:26:30] <aniasis> but what is faster to use one loop doing the calculation and append or two loops one for calculation and one for append
[13:27:30] <Eviltwin> They both have essentially the same computational overhead
[13:27:42] <Eviltwin> One requires storing all of your calculations so it takes mroe memory
[13:27:44] <Eviltwin> more*
[13:27:52] <Eviltwin> Where as the other you calculate what's needed and append
[13:28:14] <aniasis> I'm storing in the memory any way
[13:28:37] <Eviltwin> Perhaps you can show you you have
[13:28:39] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ aniasis
[13:28:40] <b-ot> aniasis: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:29:18] <Eviltwin> Preferably the former, not the latter
[13:31:08] <dcherman2> aniasis: presumably this is 500 different DOm elements you're appending - would your left/top calculations be affected by the addition ( or lack of ) any of those DOM nodes?
[13:32:08] <Eviltwin> The most expensive part of the operation is going to be appending into the live DOM
[13:32:28] <Eviltwin> If these can all be appended to an orphan node somewhere that then gets appended that will be faster
[13:32:56] <dcherman2> +1 - that's what i was going to hint at, assuming the calculations werent dependent on the preceding  node having already been appended
[13:37:18] <naeluh_> please if someone can help  http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/DsswZ/1/ I am really close I just have to get the second click function to be recognized everytime instead of immediately after the first one
[13:38:05] <encoded> hey all, im using a lightbox script and suddenly another script stopped working and i cant figure out why
[13:38:46] <encoded> well, depending on who loads first i can change who fails
[13:38:47] <naeluh_> It seems to not work if I click anywhere else but click body immediately after what would be stopping this from working ?
[13:39:31] <naeluh_> is there a way to make a click function always available in the sequence
[13:40:23] <naeluh_> please let me know if I can make this clearer
[13:42:37] <naeluh_> go to the fiddle and click shape-scale and click another shape then body it fails
[13:42:57] <naeluh_> click shape-scale thenbody it works
[13:43:31] <savid> BillCriswell_,  this isn't for form validation. I'm debugging something. I have a simple form with a hidden input, which contains about 24k of base64 data. I'm then just using $('#print_form').post(),  however in ie8 the field does not get posted (it's not just an empty value, the field itself is not included in the post data).
[13:51:30] <encoded> can lightbox handle images loaded via one of those asp redirectors?
[13:51:43] <encoded> it shouldnt matter..
[13:52:20] <encoded> where the image href is a aspx page with a query string and returns the image
[13:57:05] <plato> i am asynchronously populating a ul of results and a matching set of google maps pins. i want to provide some UI hinting when I mouseover the pins or results.
[13:58:24] <plato> i am using $('.result').each(function(){ this.mouseenter(onResultMouseover) });
[13:58:44] <plato> I don't know how to get the ID of the element from my onResultMouseover function
[13:59:29] <plato> in my onResultMouseover function I would like to call .animate() on the element that was moused over
[13:59:34] <jeffreylevesque> this statement: returns null
[13:59:36] <jeffreylevesque> alert( $('.active .short-title').html() );
[13:59:54] <jeffreylevesque> but i have wrapped the entire file with  $(document).ready(function() { }
[14:00:37] <plato> does anyone have examples or references that would help me understand how to bind events to elements within $('.result').each()?
[14:04:57] <encoded> ok i got the lightbox 'working'
[14:05:10] <encoded> but in the lightboxOverlay div there is nothing
[14:05:12] <encoded> no image
[14:07:52] <encoded> anyone know if this might be related to getting the image with a fake aspx page?
[14:22:00] <shoky> plato:  $(this).mouseenter(function() { ... })
[14:23:10] <bnason> I'm having a problem with addClass, ive got the li I want to add a class to, and if I console.log(myli); it shows that it added the class, but it doesnt show up on the page

[14:45:38] <barryhjames> I have a form in a div that is a slide down. I am using PHP to validate the form, and I am not using AJAX. Is there a way to get the slide down, when the user submits the form, to stay open once the page reloads?  Something like "if the PHP form has been submitted {execute slide down}"?
[14:48:09] <frb> barryhjames: could use a cookie, or, just use AJAX since this is exactly what it's meant for.
[14:52:30] <barryhjames> frb: I just added some PHP which made a variable within jQuery saying if POST happened, make it true. That seemed to work. Is it bad practice to use PHP inside a jQuery script tag?
[14:53:09] <frb> if you're not using AJAX in this situation, it's already bad practice imo
[14:53:57] <tongcx> how do i determine whehter a selection is successful?

[14:54:23] <frb> ?*
[14:55:05] <tongcx> will i return null or []?

[15:00:10] <coldhead> blueadept: https://github.com/fat/bean, something like that?
[15:00:38] <zubelgenubi> ...or like the next div up on the hierarchy?
[15:00:54] <coldhead> $(this).parent()
[15:01:04] <coldhead> or (better) $(this).closest('div')
[15:01:16] <coldhead> `closest
[15:01:18] <zubelgenubi> wow.    amazing
[15:01:32] * coldhead kicks b-ot
[15:01:32] <blueadept> sort of similair, looks like the way backbone does it, which is like events: fn(){ '.classname selector' : 'fn name' }, 'fn name' : fn(){}
[15:01:44] <zubelgenubi> coldhead, closest only goes up, right?
[15:01:50] <coldhead> that's right zubelgenubi

[15:25:13] <Rejected> is there a way to check if a certain string is within a textarea when a form button is clicked using JQuery?
[15:26:00] <KWhat_Work> Rejected: yes, just use regex with .val()
[15:26:15] <Rejected> I want to alert the user when a certain keyword like 'DROP' is entered in the textarea.. the code I'm trying (with no luck, btw) is this: http://pastebin.com/YWjVL2y5
[15:27:01] <KWhat_Work> Rejected: add regex to line 3
[15:28:28] <Rejected> could you please provide a simple example? I'm a newbie with jQuery and not that good with regex :f
[15:28:42] <KWhat_Work> $('#txtQuery').val().match('DROP')
[15:29:35] <Rejected> thanks KWhat_Work, I'll give it a try
[15:29:48] <blueadept> coldhead: found it! http://markdalgleish.com/projects/eventralize/
[15:31:18] <Rejected> also, would it be possible to retrieve the content of the textarea through the 'e' argument of the function?
[15:31:32] <KWhat_Work> Rejected: e.target
[15:32:04] <KWhat_Work> Rejected: only if its listening to the textbox, if your listening to the button then no

[15:59:29] <Che-Anarc> In jQM if I set <div id="aDiag" data-role="page"> for a dialog & then I link to it from another uri / page via #aDiag I only get dialog and when therein linking to #mainBody div with a button doesnt work...
[15:59:49] <Che-Anarc> I've tried data-rel="external" & dialog as well... but to no avail  :-(
[16:11:45] <BuildingAndroidA> I'm trying to script logins into sites and I need to click on an a tag but it doesn't seem to work, anybody know how to trigger a click event on an a tag?
[16:19:24] <Gazpacho> write a function that binds events to $(this) and pass the function to each(), don't really know what you're asking about.
[16:19:31] <Gazpacho> whoooops
[16:19:33] <Gazpacho> stupid scroll
[16:21:59] <BuildingAndroidA> Gazpacho were you responding to what I asked?
[16:34:31] <ogk1000> I'm wanting to do some nice parallax stuff on : http://ogkdev.com/inetico/advanced-negotiation/ - looking for inspiration / suggestions .. anyone?
[16:39:22] <glaksmono> anyone is around?
[16:39:37] <glaksmono> is there a way to make sure that title= attribute tooltip to not cover another HTML element?
[16:39:57] <glaksmono> i.e. may be customizing that to appear at the top instead
[16:40:04] <glaksmono> above the mouse?
[16:40:31] <ogk1000> ya glaksmono its called z-index :P
[16:41:42] <glaksmono> ogk1000: can you be more specific? so i add style z-index?
[16:41:50] <glaksmono> how do you add zindex to the browser default tooltip?
[16:41:51] <hagb4rd> yea..any references for a good tooltip solution not moving off-screen are welcome
[16:41:52] <glaksmono> the tooltip
[16:42:04] <hagb4rd> too
[16:42:06] <glaksmono> i don't have DOM reference to that tooltip
[16:42:22] <glaksmono> i.e. the only reference i have is to the DOM element of where the title attribute is
[16:42:24] <glaksmono> but not the tooltip
[16:42:30] <ogk1000> OHHH browser default tooltip hmm
[16:42:39] <ogk1000> what are you tryign to do exactly?
[16:42:48] <ogk1000> I know some scripts remove the title attribute from markup
[16:42:51] <glaksmono> to make sure the tooltip doesn't cover another HTML element
[16:42:56] <hagb4rd> i guess you don't want the tooltip to disappear behind z-indexed element (in front)
[16:43:04] <hagb4rd> too
[16:43:07] <glaksmono> removing the title attribute would also remove the tooltip
[16:43:31] <hagb4rd> don't you glaksmono
[16:44:05] <glaksmono> yeah
[16:44:19] <glaksmono> so by default, the tooltip is underneath the mouse cursor
[16:44:25] <glaksmono> is it possible to place at that to top of the cursor?
[16:46:32] <ogk1000> glaksmono, why not just use a custom tooltip
[16:59:14] <raj> do you guys usually separate where you setup eventHandlers and rendering stuff? Like, if I was to run .slider() on a div, and then bind 'slidechange' event in a different function, or would you chain it to .slider() (i.e., where it was initialized)?
[17:09:34] <tdignan> Hi. When working with connected sortables, via the "connectWith" property, how do I detect which list the sortable is dropped into? I tried using droppable, but that seems like the wrong way, to be quite honest.
[17:09:56] <tdignan> I had a setup working where I combined draggable, droppable, and sortable, but it was buggy. I can only conclude that it was definitely wrong.
[17:10:07] <tdignan> My thinking is I'm supposed to use sortable only.
[17:10:23] <glaksmono> btw it seems like if we're generating DOM dynamically, we cannot get its width?
[17:10:24] <djQuery> go look at the events
[17:10:46] <glaksmono> i'm generating li dynamically using JS, and i'm wondering how to get the width of the generated LI
[17:10:53] <glaksmono> width() returns 0
[17:11:02] <djQuery> tdignan, http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-receive
[17:11:20] <tdignan> \o/
[17:11:23] <tdignan> that sounds right
[17:11:31] <tdignan> thanks for the link
[17:11:35] <djQuery> glaksmono, have you added it to the dom yet?
[17:11:44] <glaksmono> not yet added back to the html
[17:11:45] <djQuery> glaksmono, no dom no width
[17:12:08] <glaksmono> so i have to append that first beore getting the width right?
[17:12:23] <djQuery> glaksmono, yes
[17:12:37] <raj> shoky, ping
[17:13:12] <djQuery> glaksmono, on your earler tooltip Qs go look at the api, there is a way to postion it
[17:13:35] <djQuery> glaksmono, http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-position
[17:14:55] <djQuery> raj, try to keep stuff organized by what it is used against.   everything for 1 element together in other words
[17:16:33] <raj> djQuery, so you prefer everything for an element together, as opposed to all eventhandlers for a page together
[17:17:09] <awolfey> I'm trying to filter dom elements first by elements of 1 array, if set, then by another array, if set, and finally by a third array if set. If my selection could be a reference it would work I think, but I know that's not really possible.
[17:17:55] <awolfey> something like this http://pastebin.com/VUgPhnLk
[17:19:54] <eddiemonge> awolfey: you dont need to do $(list) since list is already a jQ object
[17:20:32] <djQuery> awolfey, other than that it looks like it should work
[17:21:03] <awolfey> eddiemonge: where don't I need that?
[17:21:40] <djQuery> awolfey, http://pastebin.com/qPvhBWmQ
[17:23:32] <awolfey> djQuery: thanks. I need the filters to be anded together, but only if both states and certs are populated.
[17:24:23] <awolfey> djQuery: So, how to remove the non matching items as if by reference?
[17:25:31] <eddiemonge> you mean it has to have the state and cert class?
[17:26:21] <awolfey> kind of. there could be no, single or multiple states  and/or no, single or multple certs, and I need the intersection of those.
[17:26:57] <eddiemonge> check to make sure state and cert exist, then do a filter on states and then do a filter on those for certs
[17:27:17] <awolfey> eddiemonge: yes, that's what I don't know how to do
[17:27:49] <awolfey> how do I get the check in there and filter further.
[17:27:57] <awolfey> rather than starting over
[17:28:11] <eddiemonge> http://pastebin.com/5wu4xJ4V
[17:29:55] <awolfey> eddiemonge: That's what I started with, but I'll end up with 9 (or 27?) if statements to cover all the possible empty arrays. Is there a more efficient way to check? Maybe initialize each array with a bogus element?
[17:30:13] <eddiemonge> huh?
[17:30:41] <awolfey> I need to account for having states and certs, states but not certs, certs but not states, and neither.
[17:31:23] <eddiemonge> maybe draw a picture so i can understand which/what you are trying to do
[17:32:47] <awolfey> OK I have a bunch of "articles" each tagged with states, certification requirements, job type. I want to filter by any combination of those.
[17:33:54] <awolfey> An article might be tagged with MD, VA and KS, Required, and Part-time, as classes on the row.
[17:33:57] <djQuery> awolfey, is there an interface for the user to select the state, cert, type?
[17:34:08] <awolfey> yeah, there's a map and some buttons

[17:35:21] <eddiemonge> awolfey: http://pastebin.com/0PRxk2a9
[17:35:32] <awolfey> So first I select KS and if filters to all KS articles, then I add in part-time and narrow the search.

[17:46:35] <null__> What's the safest way to take the val() of an input text field and returning it to the page without rendering any script / html?
[17:48:05] <djQuery> null replace < with the the equivilent
[17:51:30] <p3lim> is there a way to easily throttle loops? doing simulations in js and it crashes/halts the browser :p
[17:51:47] <null__> Would it be possible to save the .val() into a variable and then using $(variable).html()? I know that doesn't work since I tried it, but maybe I'm just doing it the wrong way
[17:52:11] <null__> or even text()
[17:52:56] <neataroni> can someone recommend a way to get GET params from address bar?
[17:53:31] <kokoat> neataroni: parseURI
[17:53:38] <kokoat> very small library. like 30 lines of code
[17:53:48] <neataroni> kokoat: exactly what im looking for, thank you
[17:54:02] <FELS__1> anyone here use JQUI jqmobi?
[17:56:41] <neataroni> kokoat: can i grab get params that are after a #?
[17:56:53] <kokoat> neataroni: let me try hold on
[17:57:37] <neataroni> kokoat: i just tried parseURI and looked at the resulting object, i dont see a get dict anywhere
[17:58:53] <neataroni> yea, it looks like it just calls everything after # an anchor
[17:59:39] <kokoat> yeah
[17:59:42] <kokoat> what does your url look like?
[17:59:43] <neataroni> but hey, i can just parseUri the anchor and viola

[18:17:19] <tongcx> hi guys, how to get an array while $('div').attr('id') only return one?
[18:18:18] <djQuery> tongcx, think using attr with just one parameter is only going to work on the first one
[18:18:48] <tongcx> djQuery: yes, i want an array of ids instead of just the first one
[18:20:06] <djQuery> var x  = []; $('div').each(function(){ if(this.id){ x.push(this.id); }});
[18:20:34] <djQuery> or better use the selector .div[id]
[18:20:44] <djQuery> then can skip the if in the each
[18:20:56] <tongcx> djQuery: em, thanks
[18:21:30] <djQuery> tongcx, there is also see ?map

[18:34:34] <tongcx> so calling this.ts will complaint
[18:48:37] <patbam> hi, i'm trying to figure out how to capture the return of an $.ajax call in an object. I'm not sure if the problem is that i'm misunderstanding the .success method or if it's a problem with variable scope. this is a summary of what i'm trying & failing to do: http://pastie.org/6357995
[18:49:30] <patbam> should i ues async : false?
[18:55:48] <shoky> patbam: no
[18:55:56] <FELS__1> patbam, can you try success:   function(data){
[18:55:56] <FELS__1>     console.log(data)
[18:55:56] <FELS__1>   }
[18:56:05] <patbam> FELS__1: yes, that works, the data appears
[18:57:28] <patbam> FELS__1: so i'm perplexed as to why i can't put that data on my object
[18:58:06] <shoky> patbam: you can, but it'll only be there when the ajax success is called
[18:58:23] <patbam> isn't that what .success() is supposed to mean?
[18:58:45] <shoky> yep
[18:58:48] <patbam>  it seemed to me that inside of success i should be able to use normal variable scoping to store the data
[18:59:22] <shoky> donno what you mean by normal variable scoping.. but, sure, you can
[18:59:34] <FELS__1> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[18:59:49] <LocalPCGuy> patbam everything you want to do with the data HAS to be called FROM the success callback function
[19:00:20] <shoky> s/the/a/
[19:00:43] <patbam> FELS__1: i should use .done instead of .success?
[19:00:50] <shoky> they are the same
[19:00:58] <FELS__1> same thing
[19:01:13] <LocalPCGuy> patbam you can't just assign the variable there but try to use it somewhere else in your code unless you are sure that the somewhere else is going to be called AFTER the success function returns, and you can only know that for sure by calling things from the success function
[19:01:13] <gnarf> use .done instead
[19:01:22] <gnarf> they are the "Same thing"
[19:01:32] <gnarf> but ".success" is deprecated when it was written i think
[19:01:38] <LocalPCGuy> done is the new goodness
[19:01:46] <gnarf> or at least ever since it's been there, "done" is the suggested method
[19:01:51] <gnarf> it's also shorter to type ;)
[19:02:26] <gnarf> ?p @patbam
[19:02:27] <bot-t> patbam, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:02:34] <sheilablackrose> hi would anyone happen to know how to center a div for tablets? i tried using margin-left n right auto but it didnt work.
[19:02:38] <patbam> ok, i'll use jsfilddle
[19:02:58] <LocalPCGuy> btw, anyone going to be at the jQueryTO conference this weekend?
[19:03:07] <FELS__1> patbam, can you do this .. success : function (data) { self.spew }
[19:03:21] <FELS__1> LocalPCGuy, where ?
[19:03:26] <LocalPCGuy> Toronto
[19:03:31] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: yeah
[19:03:34] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: im speaking
[19:03:34] <FELS__1> :(
[19:03:41] <LocalPCGuy> I thought you may be
[19:03:45] <patbam> is ther ea way i can add a test json file to jsfiddle?
[19:03:54] <patbam> FELS__1: trying that
[19:04:01] <gnarf> patbam: more care about the js than the rest
[19:04:14] <gnarf> patbam: your problem is purely async i think
[19:04:15] <FELS__1> i am using JQM but its NOT smooth -- any ideas ?
[19:04:20] <gnarf> just need to see the code to suggest
[19:04:20] <patbam> gnarf: ok
[19:04:25] <gnarf> gist would be just as effective
[19:04:30] <LocalPCGuy> any dramatic bug reading breakout sessions planned?
[19:04:44] <patbam> oh, a gist that's a good idea
[19:04:45] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: maybe, i dunno
[19:06:10] * djQuery looks for bug to submit in Haiku 
[19:07:38] <patbam> here's a gist: https://gist.github.com/amundo/5062195
[19:08:26] <patbam> i have gone back and forth between a Manifest function constructor-style approach and a manifest = {} object literal approach… can't seem to get either working
[19:09:49] <patbam> i see now that this particular attempt has .getJSON not .ajax, but they should be equivalent, no?
[19:15:22] <LocalPCGuy> patbam pretty sure that when your app runs, it returns this.files immediately, before the load() function finishes.
[19:16:59] <patbam> LocalPCGuy: any thoughts about how i might get around that?
[19:17:01] <innociv> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport Does this not work with a newer jquery? I'm getting errors.
[19:17:16] <LocalPCGuy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3619888/jquery-ajax-request-inside-a-function-how-to-return-the-value-i-got
[19:17:39] <FELS__1> anyone here a JQM guru .. need some helps pls
[19:17:47] <LocalPCGuy> that might give you some ideas, I'm still thinking
[19:18:32] <patbam> LocalPCGuy: thanks for your help, taking a look
[19:18:45] <LocalPCGuy> patbam could you pass a callback function into the lookup function that could be called when the ajax call is done?
[19:19:41] <FELS__1> patbam, what about : pass in your function to call on success then >   success: theCallBackFunction ( result )
[19:19:42] <patbam> LocalPCGuy: hmm, well one bug i see now is the return value is wiping out my functions
[19:20:51] <patbam> heck i guess i could just do "return this"
[19:20:55] <LocalPCGuy> patbam I'm fairly sure you'll need to use a callback
[19:20:59] <LocalPCGuy> fn
[19:22:51] <LocalPCGuy> something like var cbFunc(data) = function(){}; myapp.lookup('hil001', cbFunc);
[19:23:03] <patbam> LocalPCGuy: oh, hmm…
[19:23:26] <LocalPCGuy> errr heh...that should be cbFunc = function(data)...
[19:24:07] <LocalPCGuy> patbam and then inside of this.store you would need to execute cbFunc
[19:24:14] <LocalPCGuy> or call it
[19:24:29] <patbam> LocalPCGuy: so i put the onus on the caller of the metadata function, rather than trying to get metadata to initialize itself
[19:24:46] <LocalPCGuy> not sure how your scoping is going to be setup, so not 100% sure it'll just work like that
[19:24:51] <sunuslee> is there any good icon set like http://glyphish.com/ but free and more focus on mobile app?
[19:25:33] <LocalPCGuy> well, your metadata is still initializing itself, and this.store could still pass your object to the callback function
[19:25:59] <LocalPCGuy> it just needs to happen asyncronously
[19:28:01] <patbam> yeah. still nosing around various articles and iwonder if promises might help, too
[19:28:03] <patbam> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises/ for instance
[19:28:32] <LocalPCGuy> you could return the promise from your Metadata
[19:28:44] <LocalPCGuy> and then use .when to access the result when it completes
[19:28:52] <LocalPCGuy> (I think...)
[19:29:11] <LocalPCGuy> here's another SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5403342/js-return-result-from-nested-ajax-success-function
[19:29:42] <LocalPCGuy> has a promises solution and a callback solution
[19:32:39] <patbam> trying the promises solution
[19:36:30] <patbam> this topic always makes me feel so incompetent, heh.

[19:44:54] <raj> so jqui tabs no longer has an 'add' method?
[19:45:05] <raj> so how does one add a tab?
[19:47:15] <LocalPCGuy> raj add the tab in the DOM and do refresh()

[19:48:59] <raj> interesting
[19:48:59] <raj> k
[19:49:10] <raj> maybe I'll just roll out my own tabs
[19:49:10] <LocalPCGuy> raj http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-add-and-remove-methods-and-events-use-refresh-method
[19:49:18] <LocalPCGuy> i like easytabs
[19:49:27] <LocalPCGuy> basic JS tabs, bring your own styling
[19:53:32] <raj> I gotta stop adding library after library!
[19:53:32] <raj> :)
[19:56:54] <paxcoder> speaking of adding libraries, am I missing something: I'm getting Uncaught "TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'hashchange' "?
[19:57:16] <LocalPCGuy> ?jsfiddle
[19:57:16] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[19:57:33] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy,
[19:57:34] <paxcoder>     $(window).hashchange(search);
[19:57:34] <paxcoder>     $(window).hashchange();
[19:57:37] <coldhead> paxcoder: you have to include jQuery first, THEN plugins
[19:57:59] <paxcoder> coldhead, i don't use plugins. Is hashchange event defined in a plugin?
[19:58:33] <coldhead> i've only ever used it as a plugin
[19:58:46] <coldhead> but it's pretty much my first day with hashchange events
[19:58:58] <coldhead> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[19:59:11] <LocalPCGuy> that's the plugin I've used as well
[19:59:38] <paxcoder> that should be in the core, don't you agree?
[19:59:41] <LocalPCGuy> some browsers may emit the change even natively, but it is no where near full support
[20:00:30] <LocalPCGuy> you could just listen to window.onhashchange - or jquery $(window).on('hashchange', function)
[20:00:40] <coldhead> it's not too onerous to use the plugin
[20:00:47] <LocalPCGuy> but you'd need to test x-browser a lot
[20:00:49] <LocalPCGuy> right
[20:01:24] <paxcoder> perhaps i could add 'onhashchange' as well. but what happens if it's not there?
[20:01:29] <paxcoder> maybe i should try
[20:01:29] <LocalPCGuy> nothing
[20:01:31] <cobalt238> Can someone explain what the jquery mobile navbar I'm using looks "weird" in the first menu, but fine when I switch to the second?  (http://tinyurl.com/bcb7fob)
[20:01:31] <LocalPCGuy> literally
[20:02:12] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, afa compat is concerned: That's among top 2 reasons why I use jQuery
[20:02:19] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[20:03:11] <LocalPCGuy> caniuse.com/hashchange
[20:03:19] <LocalPCGuy> looks like the support is getting pretty decent
[20:05:51] <cobalt238> I checked the source code of the two pages and they're pretty much the same--the first page just has  a strange line across the menu
[20:08:17] <paxcoder> interesting,     $(window).on(['hashchange', 'onhashchange'], search); didn't work, i had to individually add each
[20:08:56] <LocalPCGuy> you can do this: $(window).on('hashchange onhashchange'...
[20:09:08] <LocalPCGuy> although what browser is firing onhashchange?
[20:09:23] <tw2113> my head hurts coldhead
[20:09:34] <coldhead> what happen michael
[20:09:35] <LocalPCGuy> is it too cold?
[20:09:36] <coldhead> drinking?
[20:09:41] <tw2113> no
[20:09:43] <coldhead> philosophy?
[20:09:46] <coldhead> girl trouble?
[20:09:49] <tw2113> js functions
[20:10:01] <coldhead> those should be relatively painless!
[20:10:05] <paxcoder> same goes for triggerEvent
[20:10:08] <coldhead> you must have croseed the streams
[20:10:09] <tw2113> got done reading resig's first chapter on functions
[20:10:14] <coldhead> oh
[20:10:15] <coldhead> right
[20:10:19] <coldhead> that kind of headache
[20:10:22] <coldhead> thanks for nothing resig
[20:10:46] <tw2113> my skull hasn't appropriated the space yet for my expanded mind
[20:10:59] <coldhead> more coffee!
[20:11:06] <coldhead> was it any good?
[20:11:06] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, i guess none, but i'll try your thing too, just to see if it'd work if there was one :-P
[20:11:15] <tw2113> i'm enjoying the book so far
[20:11:21] <tw2113> it's getting to the fundamentals
[20:11:24] <LocalPCGuy> yah, space between events is how to listen to multiple
[20:11:36] <LocalPCGuy> the ninja book?
[20:11:43] <tw2113> yup LocalPCGuy
[20:11:54] <LocalPCGuy> taking it on the train ride to Toronto to read
[20:11:59] <LocalPCGuy> this weekend
[20:12:02] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, it does
[20:12:06] <coldhead> oh you're going to that LocalPCGuy ?
[20:12:09] <LocalPCGuy> yah
[20:12:11] <coldhead> you're in canadia but not toronto?
[20:12:13] <paxcoder> so only arrays don't work, weird
[20:12:20] <LocalPCGuy> I'm in MI (US)
[20:12:24] <coldhead> ahh
[20:12:33] <LocalPCGuy> gonna hop across the border and take the train from windsor
[20:12:39] <coldhead> well have fun, i'm jelly
[20:12:50] <coldhead> the toronto js people are lovely
[20:12:53] <tw2113> 4 ways to invoke functions
[20:13:05] <LocalPCGuy> yah, definitley looking forward to it
[20:13:07] <tw2113> as a function, as a method, as a constructor, and with apply() or call()
[20:13:29] <coldhead> mmm, elegant JS
[20:13:59] <tw2113> i understand the first 3 fairly well
[20:14:23] <tw2113> method and constructors remind me much of php oop
[20:14:24] <LocalPCGuy> I always have to look up call/apply to remember which is which
[20:14:28] <tw2113> diferent syntax though
[20:14:35] <LocalPCGuy> I think...apply is the array one?
[20:14:36] <coldhead> me too LocalPCGuy
[20:14:39] <coldhead> i bet most people do
[20:14:52] <LocalPCGuy> array syntax, I mean
[20:14:53] <coldhead> i bet crockford and eich have to look it up
[20:14:54] <tw2113> yeah
[20:14:57] <LocalPCGuy> a=a
[20:15:03] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[20:15:11] <LocalPCGuy> c=comma
[20:15:21] <LocalPCGuy> there we go, mnemonics
[20:15:28] <LocalPCGuy> or however spelling that goes
[20:15:59] <tw2113> johnny mnemonic?
[20:16:04] <LocalPCGuy> but yah, I'll stil need to look it up next time I need to use it
[20:16:21] <tw2113> apply/call are great for applying context to whatever the fuck we want
[20:17:02] <coldhead> LocalPCGuy: make sure you say hi to vladikoff in TO
[20:17:06] * vladikoff waves
[20:17:17] <coldhead> he's a good guy
[20:17:44] <tw2113> does he document his code?
[20:18:01] <LocalPCGuy> sure thing!  no idea how I'll know him, but if I see vlad sometime, I'll say hi
[20:18:23] <coldhead> you'll know
[20:18:24] <tw2113> coldhead, does vladikoff always take care of his closures?
[20:18:30] <coldhead> oh god, you'll know
[20:18:36] <LocalPCGuy> haha
[20:18:43] <coldhead> yeah he's pretty tidy with closures
[20:18:53] <coldhead> he's never leaked any of MY ram if you know what i mean
[20:19:22] <tw2113> *wink wink*

[21:11:12] <Che-Anarc> In jQM is there anyway I can do $( "#dialog" ).close( function(err){ alert("removed dialog"); } ); - trying to dynamically remove certian dialogs in pages where they are present.
[21:15:03] <scar> I have attempted various methods of having a very short yet wide window "slide in" from the right of the screen, for say "like us on facebook", etc. well, i am not sure of the best. should i (1) .animate() the initial 0px width of the window to my desired width? or do i (2) maybe create the window and have it be "off screen" somehow, and WITHOUT scrollbars and then have it slide in?? or (3) something else?
[21:16:18] <scar> this is purty annoyng lol
[21:17:30] <coldhead> LOL
[21:17:50] <coldhead> scar: i tend to like 2)
[21:18:03] <scar> well, how the F is #2 accomplished PROPERLY? lol
[21:18:07] <scar> im tearing my eyes out :D
[21:18:17] <coldhead> margin-left: -9999999em;
[21:18:21] <scar> the prob is , the content in the window gets squished
[21:18:29] <scar> ahh, so animate the margin?
[21:18:33] <scar> -999999em to 0 ?
[21:18:34] <coldhead> or position:absolute; left:-999999em;
[21:18:37] <coldhead> and then animate left
[21:18:38] <coldhead> yes
[21:19:01] <scar> that will make it fly in from right without having the content adjust with the size of the window? lol
[21:19:26] <LocalPCGuy> #2 tends to be the smoothest
[21:19:32] <paxcoder> could i find all elements with data attributes with something like "[data-*]" ?
[21:20:05] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[21:20:27] <scar> also i have been using the FB api or whichever to have a callback after the like button is clicked (event subscribe)-- anyway, www.edwinwattsgolf.com has a slide in that when you click like it somehow does NOT have the comment box appear like when you normall click facebook like. the comment box is a box that pops up allowing you to post a comment / share. gets ugly if its not meant to be there =P
[21:20:33] <scar> LocalPCGuy, for sure #1 isnt smooth =P
[21:20:42] <scar> unless i open the window then fade in the content
[21:20:44] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, thanks
[21:21:05] <coldhead> so many problems
[21:21:51] <scar> not really a problem-- more of a this guy is doin it and i cant figure out why. it appears he may actually be creating his own facebook button code, which lets me believe he's  tapping into a FB API area that i am not aware of
[21:21:53] <scar> but i am not usre
[21:21:54] <scar> sure*
[21:22:30] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, any way to get the array of those attributes? Eg ['data-smth', 'data-else']?
[21:23:27] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder hmm...well, you could iterate over the jquery object and create such an array
[21:23:28] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, wait, you told me how to match attribute values
[21:23:35] <paxcoder> i meant the attribute names themselves
[21:23:42] <paxcoder> (keys if you will)
[21:24:01] <scar> not many people know about the FB stuff
[21:25:04] <LocalPCGuy> scar if you use the FB iframe like plugin there is no comment box (or you can hide the comment box with a wrapper & overflow hidden
[21:25:33] <LocalPCGuy> scar and then it is easy to subscribe to event.create for the like event and then create a share dialog
[21:25:45] <LocalPCGuy> whenever the event fires
[21:25:51] <scar> yeah for sure, but i cant seem to accomplish either one of the first 2 things you mentioned
[21:26:21] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder duh...sry
[21:27:00] <scar> LocalPCGuy, jas
[21:28:02] <BryanRuiz> im looking for a slideDown that slides from the bottom up instead of the top down
[21:28:11] <BryanRuiz> any thoughts?
[21:28:15] <scar> LocalPCGuy, http://pastebin.com/DbWqFi3k
[21:28:23] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, that's ok, you're trying to help. There doesn't seem to be such a pattern, filtering is suggested. I'll just use a white-list for now. I don't like the idea of another layer of slow.
[21:28:58] <scar> LocalPCGuy, just trying to have a window fade in / out and such, i got the subscribe fire to work a long time ago. there is a delay so when commenet box pops up, its there for a bit. www.edwinwattsgolf.com does not have it
[21:29:13] <paxcoder> though, jquery would've been even slower had it had that (due to pattern parsing)
[21:31:37] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder you can just do $('[attributename]') I'm just not sure if you can use wildcards there
[21:34:38] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, One more question if you don't mind: if listening to submit events on a form, how do i get the input[type=submit] that caused the submit? Click (using .click or '[clicked=true]') won't do because it might really be an "enter" in an input[type=text].
[21:34:58] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder you can listen for the submit event on the form
[21:35:18] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder that should have a target on the event object
[21:35:19] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, yes, that's what i'm doing. I just want to determine the button which caused it
[21:35:42] <paxcoder> i think the target is the form itself, isn't it?
[21:35:58] <coldhead> event.target is different to the target=""
[21:36:03] <systemfault> There's target and currentTarget, check both.
[21:36:05] <coldhead> event.target is what was actually clicked
[21:36:06] <LocalPCGuy> hmm...might be
[21:36:21] <paxcoder> coldhead, what if enter was actually pressed? what's the target then?
[21:36:35] <paxcoder> i mean when in a field, not focused on a button
[21:40:04] <paxcoder> i think it'd be an input[type=text]
[21:41:07] <LocalPCGuy> this is a perfect place to toss together a quick fiddle and see what it is
[21:41:11] <LocalPCGuy> :P

[21:42:52] <systemfault> coldhead: What are this usage of unicode called?
[21:43:18] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, it seems even with a click, the event.target is the form, not its input children
[21:43:24] <paxcoder> *one of
[21:43:24] <coldhead> this is called zalgo, systemfault
[21:43:27] <coldhead> he cometh
[21:44:34] <LocalPCGuy> yah http://jsfiddle.net/localpcguy/BPjG9/1/
[21:44:59] <systemfault> coldhead: Ah, thanks :P
[21:45:30] <coldhead> VERY WELCOME
[21:45:39] <coldhead> all my svn commit messages use zalgo
[21:45:44] <coldhead> it brings me happiness
[21:46:04] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder you can always listen for a keyup event on your inputs and then look for the keycode 13 for enter
[21:46:21] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, ungh :-)
[21:46:22] <LocalPCGuy> flip a variable flag and then the submit could check that flag
[21:46:27] <LocalPCGuy> yah, ugh
[21:47:16] <LocalPCGuy> or do the flip with a click event on submit, but not sure if you can guarantee the click executes first
[21:47:37] <coldhead> hnnnhg
[21:48:53] <LocalPCGuy> scar what is the problem with the pastebin code (what is it not doing?)
[21:49:09] <scar> LocalPCGuy, it shows the comment box
[21:49:10] <scar> lol
[21:49:31] <LocalPCGuy> that isn't something the JS prevents from showing
[21:49:51] <LocalPCGuy> you cannot affect it with JS, x-domain communication between domains, etc
[21:50:55] <LocalPCGuy> you either have to use the iframe version of the like plugin (kinda uck) or you have to wrap the like button with a container, set the height/width exactly the same as the like button and set an overflow hidden.  Almost as uck
[21:51:17] <LocalPCGuy> I know of no programmatic way of stopping the comment box from showing
[21:51:51] <LocalPCGuy> (I assume you mean the automatic Facebook comment that comes out of the Like button when you click it)
[22:01:52] <evilaim> I need to learn this stuff...
[22:02:05] <evilaim> any good tutorial walk through avaliable you guys suggest?
[22:03:35] <LocalPCGuy> http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/
[22:03:58] <LocalPCGuy> I put this together a while back: http://www.local-pc-guy.com/web-dev/javascript-resources
[22:05:41] <lethjakman_lapto> hey, I'm trying to send an ajax request to my server as so: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5062748
[22:05:48] <lethjakman_lapto> but it seems to be getting encapsolated a second time
[22:05:51] <lethjakman_lapto> any clue why?
[22:06:10] <LocalPCGuy> what type of server?
[22:06:12] <lethjakman_lapto> could this be jquery?
[22:06:16] <lethjakman_lapto> thisrails
[22:06:20] <lethjakman_lapto> *rails
[22:06:34] <paxcoder> i could at least get an id of a clicked button via "$('input[type=submit][clicked=true]').attr('id')" now i can't do that either :-/
[22:06:46] <bnb_dev> Hello All!
[22:07:18] <LocalPCGuy> lethjakman_lapto seems like the server is escaping it before sending
[22:07:58] <lethjakman_lapto> LocalPCGuy: I'm sending it to the server and having it interpret it
[22:07:59] <LocalPCGuy> or maybe not converting it to JSON first?  don't think it is anything jquery is doing
[22:08:01] <lethjakman_lapto> that's what's showing up on the server
[22:08:08] <LocalPCGuy> oh...yah, post
[22:08:11] <lethjakman_lapto> hm, maybe
[22:08:31] <systemfault> paxcoder: I don't know about your problem but perhaps your idea is bad… so that's why you have so much difficulty implementing it
[22:08:58] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder why are you trying to know exactly what triggered the form submit?
[22:09:05] <lethjakman_lapto> thank you
[22:10:22] <LocalPCGuy> lethjakman_lapto I take it back -
[22:10:22] <LocalPCGuy> processData (default: true)
[22:10:22] <LocalPCGuy> Type: Boolean
[22:10:22] <LocalPCGuy> By default, data passed in to the data option as an object (technically, anything other than a string) will be processed and transformed into a query string, fitting to the default content-type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". If you want to send a DOMDocument, or other non-processed data, set this option to false.
[22:10:33] <LocalPCGuy> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:10:42] <LocalPCGuy> processData option
[22:11:25] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, because each submit button has a different function
[22:11:49] <paxcoder> (but works with the same input[type=text] fields)
[22:11:56] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder hmm...seems weird.  are you on .net where you only have 1 form on the page/
[22:11:57] <LocalPCGuy> ?
[22:12:09] <paxcoder> what?
[22:12:25] <LocalPCGuy> are you using the .Net server side language
[22:12:30] <raj> how would I make a button with 3 lines of styled text?
[22:12:38] <paxcoder> no. i'm not using any server side language atm
[22:12:55] <LocalPCGuy> then I'd make a separate form for each action with separate submits
[22:12:58] <paxcoder> which is why forms aren't really submitted, and the event is handled by jquery
[22:13:10] <systemfault> raj: <button type="button">content here</button>?
[22:13:20] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, as i've said, both buttons work witih the same fields
[22:13:37] <raj> systemfault, I can't put <p> within the <button></button>s
[22:13:43] <LocalPCGuy> does it have to be an actual form if it is all processed with JS?
[22:14:04] <systemfault> raj: HTML and CSS are two different things… you can make a <span> display: block; for example
[22:14:06] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, I was hoping to be able to have a single submit event handler
[22:14:18] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, for when pressing enter in an input field too
[22:14:18] <raj> and make the span look like a button?
[22:14:28] <raj> or use the span for stylizing the text
[22:14:29] <raj> ?
[22:14:47] <coldhead> oh god are we still talking about this
[22:14:54] <systemfault> raj: I thought I understood your issue… now I'm not certain.
[22:15:03] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, and then just go through cases (of ids of clicked/typed elements) to determine what to do with the data
[22:15:27] <systemfault> raj: What kind of button do you need? A generic one? A submit button?
[22:16:19] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder you could still use the same event handler by listening for clicks on the buttons and a keyup listener listening for enter that clicks the appropriate button depending on which input the enter was on
[22:16:38] <paxcoder> I don' understand why $('input[type=submit][clicked=true]') results in an empty array, even though i click on an input[type=submit]
[22:16:50] <LocalPCGuy> so there would be 2 listener functions - one listening for the keyup keycode 13 on inputs and one for clicks on the buttons
[22:16:57] <evilaim> Can't I just buy one of you high end java guys?
[22:17:03] <raj> generic
[22:17:05] <evilaim> like a slav?
[22:17:08] <evilaim> slave*
[22:17:14] <LocalPCGuy> ehum...it's javaSCRIPT evil
[22:17:24] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, as you can see above, i'm trying to cover the click case now, but something's not working
[22:17:26] <evilaim> :)
[22:18:48] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder yah, I wouldn't try to make real complex selectors, for me that is often a sign that I am going down the wrong road
[22:20:01] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, there's no other way if i want to handle the form event
[22:20:30] <LocalPCGuy> well, you can still block the submit event and then handle the individual events the way I already described
[22:20:58] <raj> actually, systemfault, I get no validation error with <button><p></p></button>, but on my local site, I get an error http://paste.ofcode.org/39aR9xE2gn2mg3aHmrpjtwy
[22:21:11] <systemfault> paxcoder: Looks like you're trying to do too many things with a form… perhaps you should use another approach
[22:21:30] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder clicked isn't a valid attribute on an input (submit or not)
[22:21:35] <LocalPCGuy> I don't think?
[22:21:59] <systemfault> raj: You're supposed to have that error, button only accepts phrasing content
[22:22:09] <systemfault> raj: Why do you want a <p> there?
[22:22:41] <systemfault> raj: Don't forget that with CSS, you can make any element behave like another.
[22:22:57] <LocalPCGuy> raj link tags are your friends for buttons
[22:23:19] <LocalPCGuy> that need to be styled more than a <button> allows
[22:23:28] <raj> but why is <button><p></p></button> not invalid?
[22:23:31] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, i think it worked. It's featured in two SO answers
[22:23:45] <paxcoder> but i'll do individual button bindings instead
[22:23:46] <systemfault> raj: Because it goes against the HTML rules...
[22:23:57] <paxcoder> i'm not happy though
[22:24:03] <LocalPCGuy> paxcoder you can bind to individual buttons but still use the same function
[22:24:31] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, The whole point of individual bindings is to find out what's clicked.
[22:24:40] <bnb_dev> I have nested ul li , here I pasted the code http://jsfiddle.net/3H6BR/, I want to get the number of ancestors UL of an li that contains text 'A', I wrote the code it should return 2 but it returns 3
[22:24:47] <paxcoder> since this [clicked=true] thing turns out nothing, it's useless
[22:24:54] <raj> systemfault, why's it NOT invalid?
[22:25:06] <paxcoder> also useless is the form (and submitting with enter)
[22:25:26] <firedfox> from the css spec: When an inline box contains a block box, the inline box are broken around the block.
[22:25:52] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/b7eeSL373QDKDhHCFMUkNa <-- this is valid
[22:26:31] <systemfault> raj: Because in HTML, there are flow elements and phrasing element… and you cannot have block elements in most of phrasing elements
[22:26:32] <djQuery> paxcoder, $('.submitbuttonsselector').click(function(){  var btn = $(this); btn.closest('form').data('submitbutton', this.name);})
[22:27:06] <djQuery> paxcoder, then in the submit handler you can tell which button was clicked
[22:27:23] <systemfault> raj: You haven't answered my question though… Why do you want a <p> inside your button? What does a <p> do ?
[22:27:53] <LocalPCGuy> djQuery couldn't he also set a btnClicked var = to the clicked link?
[22:28:02] <LocalPCGuy> with a click event
[22:28:28] <LocalPCGuy> but the question is, can we guarantee the click will always fire before the submit event.  If so, then golden
[22:28:38] <djQuery> LocalPCGuy, sure I haven't been paying attention
[22:28:41] <LocalPCGuy> I'm not 100% sure on that
[22:28:45] <paxcoder> djQuery, or i can just bind all buttons to the same function which takes evt, and then inspect its evt.target
[22:28:56] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[22:28:58] <paxcoder> djQuery, wasn't the point. but thanks for trying to help
[22:28:58] <raj> systemfault, it allows me to style the text inside a button
[22:29:21] <raj> it would be nice to use the correct element
[22:29:26] <raj> as opposed to a div
[22:29:30] <LocalPCGuy> raj link (a tag) are your friend for styling.  Buttons are system elements, not browser elements
[22:29:39] <systemfault> raj: A <p>aragraph doesn't make sense in a button...
[22:29:45] <LocalPCGuy> raj and as such, there are limitations on how much you can style them
[22:29:46] <djQuery> paxcoder, think I was getting a couple issues confused.
[22:30:00] <systemfault> raj: It's even worse than a <div>… and of course, using a <div> inside a button would also be illegal.
[22:30:01] <paxcoder> LocalPCGuy, you were right, there is no such thing as a clicked attribute
[22:30:07] <bnb_dev> can some one let me know the solution?
[22:30:19] <paxcoder> it's added manually in suggestions on SO. wonder why i thought i saw it working
[22:30:45] <djQuery> paxcoder, if ur still having issues can you throw up a demo
[22:30:48] <systemfault> raj: What is that button for? A link or a submit button?
[22:31:12] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev ugh, stop using alerts please.  console.log or document.write to a debug element in your fiddle result
[22:31:32] <systemfault> Actually..
[22:31:40] <systemfault> alert() is WAY preferable to document.write.
[22:31:43] <bnb_dev> LocalPCGuy: ok
[22:31:52] <systemfault> Just learn to use console.log
[22:31:59] <paxcoder> djQuery, nah, it's ok. i'm just going to wire up everything individually, no form
[22:32:11] <paxcoder> too bad for the input[type=text] though
[22:32:15] <raj> oh, <button><span></span></button> works great
[22:32:16] <raj> thank you
[22:32:19] <raj> that validated
[22:32:24] <tw2113> console.log > dirt > alert : document.write
[22:32:30] <tw2113> > even
[22:32:39] <LocalPCGuy> systemfault for fiddles, nothing wrong with a little old fashioned document.write :P
[22:32:44] <systemfault> raj: Sure, <span> is inline
[22:33:12] <systemfault> LocalPCGuy: It's always wrong because it kills the whole DOM if called when the HTML is parsed
[22:33:33] <LocalPCGuy> systemfault sure, in any kind of production code.  for fiddles...doesn't make 1 bit of difference
[22:33:44] <LocalPCGuy> fiddlesticks!
[22:34:10] <systemfault> Except when it does...
[22:34:57] <LocalPCGuy> show me a fiddle where someone used document.write to show the number of elements in a collection that broke the page, and I'll retract my statement
[22:35:08] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[22:36:01] <systemfault> LocalPCGuy: http://jsfiddle.net/MDW36/
[22:36:51] <bnb_dev> LocalPCGuy: I updated the code http://jsfiddle.net/3H6BR/1/
[22:37:17] <systemfault> We're trying to help people… if we also have to help them debugging their debugging statements… we're F'ed.
[22:37:19] <LocalPCGuy> so bnb_dev - $("li:contains('A')").find('li').attr('class')  - attr always only returns on the first element in the collection, regardless of how many in the collection
[22:37:32] <LocalPCGuy> systemfault I can buy that argument
[22:38:08] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev $("li:contains('A')").find('li').length = 6
[22:38:10] <systemfault> Is it me of jsfiddle is getting slower and buggier all the time? :(
[22:38:17] <LocalPCGuy> seems like it
[22:39:09] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev when you do .parents(), it is also counting the LI that is a parent
[22:39:10] <systemfault> bnb_dev's link makes jsfiddle stick to the "initializing the awesome" message..
[22:39:33] <LocalPCGuy> strike that last
[22:40:15] <bnb_dev> LocalPCGuy: I want to count the ul that are ancestors of li that contains 'A', so how I exclude the li from the result?
[22:40:38] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev I missed the 'ul' you had
[22:40:51] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev so strike the bit about the li being counted, it wasn't
[22:41:34] <bnb_dev> LocalPCGuy: ok I got your point
[22:41:39] <bnb_dev> thanks
[22:44:52] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev  li.item-a
[22:44:52] <LocalPCGuy> 1: li.item-b
[22:44:52] <LocalPCGuy> 2: li.item-1
[22:44:52] <LocalPCGuy> 3: li.item-2
[22:44:52] <LocalPCGuy> 4: li.item-3
[22:44:53] <LocalPCGuy> 5: li.item-c are all matched by your contains(a) selector
[22:46:50] <bnb_dev> LocalPCGuy: actually I want to find the li that has text 'A' then I want to find it's number of parents UL
[22:47:12] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev yup, and you are matching too many LIs before trying to match the parents
[22:47:53] <bnb_dev> so what is the best way?
[22:48:42] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev well, do you just want the first match or do you need to match more than one 'A'
[22:48:43] <LocalPCGuy> ?
[22:49:37] <coldhead> I often hear the new poetry from your scratchy throat at quarter-after-three
[22:49:37] <coldhead> More lyrics: http://www.lyricsmania.com/the_roots_and_the_ruins_lyrics_karate.html
[22:49:38] <systemfault> In practice, your JS should not depends on the content inside your markup…
[22:49:43] <coldhead> >: |
[22:49:50] <LocalPCGuy> systemfault good point
[22:50:12] <bnb_dev> LocalPCGuy: first matched A'
[22:50:33] <LocalPCGuy> this works then http://jsfiddle.net/localpcguy/3H6BR/3/
[22:50:41] <LocalPCGuy> not going to say I would recommend it, but it works
[22:50:55] <LocalPCGuy> eq(0) gives you the first element in the collection
[22:52:46] <bnb_dev> LocalPCGuy: ok, well if text 'A' is unique then?
[22:53:11] <LocalPCGuy> why are you matching on text?  do you control the DOM structure?
[22:53:28] <LocalPCGuy> ideally you would have a class or ID you could use as a selector
[22:54:46] <bnb_dev> I have top navigation bar that contains Home, Courses, Living etc links, when some click on Courses then resulting page has sliding menu, I will multiply it width with number and parents and get the margin left.
[22:55:08] <LocalPCGuy> is courses always the 2nd link?
[22:55:40] <bnb_dev> see the example that I am building
[22:55:42] <bnb_dev> http://www.bnb-sol.com/demo/projects/pic/articles/Courses
[22:56:30] <bnb_dev> Yes it is always third
[22:56:48] <LocalPCGuy> bnb_dev so you could use .eq(2) instead of contains
[22:57:17] <bnb_dev> LocalPCGuy: ok
[22:57:33] <LocalPCGuy> like $('ul').children('li').eq(2) stuff
[22:57:45] <LocalPCGuy> actually, you need to be more specific than that
[22:58:00] <bnb_dev> ok
[22:58:01] <LocalPCGuy> probably add a class to the top level and reference from that
[22:58:30] <bnb_dev> yes your suggestion is better
[23:22:37] <Krisostoomus> Hello! Why is the pq() command used in phpQuery?
[23:24:03] <tw2113> how should we know
[23:24:09] <Cork> Krisostoomus: you qould have to ask them that
[23:24:39] <Krisostoomus> its jquery port.....
[23:24:56] <tw2113> and
[23:25:33] <tw2113> i could go port jQuery to something else, completely unbeknownst to the jQuery core team
[23:25:36] <Cork> its written in php; so of course its a port
[23:25:58] <tw2113> i wouldn't expect them to know about it at all or about my decisions
[23:26:01] <Krisostoomus> yeah
[23:26:03] <tw2113> if they did, cool, but you get my point
[23:26:58] <Krisostoomus> i need to parse some forums, that's why i use this.
[23:27:36] <tw2113> and we're not saying not to use it
[23:27:42] <tw2113> but we're not a support channel for it
[23:27:57] <Krisostoomus> cool
[23:28:35] <Cork> Krisostoomus: try #phpquery
[23:28:46] <Krisostoomus> I'm it it alone :D
[23:28:51] <Krisostoomus> in
[23:28:57] <Cork> uh... when why are you asking here?
[23:29:10] <tw2113> try contacting the dev via github
[23:29:22] <Krisostoomus> great ok
[23:31:16] <Krisostoomus> big talk of nothing ;)
[23:31:39] <tw2113> ok
[23:32:04] <tw2113> Cork, i feel accomplished tonight
[23:32:09] <Cork> ok?
[23:32:49] <tw2113> i wrote a small block of jQuery that selects all checked posts in one of the WordPress admin screens, and turns it into a shortcode to copy
[23:33:28] <tw2113> for a plugin i'm working on
[23:34:45] <Cork> well its always nice when things you feel you need starts to work
[23:57:09] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys. I have this code to get a "hover" class on iPad. It adds the class when a user touches the button, and removes it when the finger is lifted again. It works fine with SETTING the class, but it doesn't remove it?
[23:57:10] <jaffipaffi> http://jsfiddle.net/btbEB/
[23:57:36] <jaffipaffi> I have put a console.log('TRIGGERED') on, and it's both triggered on touchstart and touchend? So it makes no sence that it doesn't remove the class afterwards!?
[23:59:50] <raj> systemfault, what if I styled it to not be inline?
[23:59:53] <raj> would I get an error?
