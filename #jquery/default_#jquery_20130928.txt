[00:04:21] <hExDJ> does anyone know what this means? http://d.pr/i/IGOd
[00:04:46] <hExDJ> I am using a library that used 1.10.0 and I am trying to use 1.10.2
[00:04:53] <jphase> hExDJ: try this instead:    jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[00:05:07] <hExDJ> thanks jphase
[00:05:08] <jphase> might be in noConflict mode
[00:05:13] <jphase> np
[00:05:38] <jphase> WordPress for example uses noConflict
[00:05:44] <hExDJ> hmm, now it says jQuery is not defined
[00:06:20] <jphase> oh, then you must not have the library on the page at the time of your call
[00:06:36] <hExDJ> but I do
[00:06:37] <hExDJ> http://d.pr/i/VAOY
[00:07:39] <jphase> hmm
[00:07:51] <jphase> you have a public URL to this by chance?
[00:08:20] <hExDJ> well, it works on their site: http://geedmo.github.io/yamm/
[00:08:24] <hExDJ> that's what I am trying to use
[00:08:41] <hExDJ> but the package I downlaoded, which seems the same, gives me those errors locally
[00:09:25] <jphase> pastebin.ws your entire source so I can save locally as well
[00:09:45] <jphase> oh actually
[00:09:50] <jphase> there's a bunch of libraries... hmm
[00:10:06] <jphase> sec
[00:10:29] <hExDJ> thanks
[00:10:49] <jphase> oh I see
[00:11:21] <jphase> hExDJ: try including your google jquery library with http:// just to see if that fixes
[00:11:40] <jphase> I think // locally might resolve to file:/// in some cases
[00:11:42] <jphase> but not sure
[00:11:55] <jphase> unless you're running a web server that is
[00:18:06] <hExDJ> ahh I see
[00:19:26] <hExDJ> that was it
[00:19:29] <hExDJ> thanks jphase
[00:19:32] <jphase> np
[00:48:08] <gnu_d> Hi, I'm getting the following error: TypeError: document is null, in safeFrag = document.createDocumentFragment();, this is error from some plugin, is there a way to catch the error, so it won't be displayed ?
[00:49:25] <jphase> gnu_d: you could dig into the line number it occurs on
[00:49:43] <jphase> hard to say without a working copy
[00:49:46] <gnu_d> jphase: I did, I don't have a clue
[00:50:29] <jphase> gnu_d: do you have a live URL for this?
[00:50:32] <gnu_d> jphase: jquery.js (line 5986) from  jQuery JavaScript Library v1.10.2
[00:50:50] <gnu_d> jphase: alas I don't have a public ip :(
[00:51:59] <jphase> gnu_d: you mentioned plugin, is this like a WordPress site or something?
[00:53:34] <gnu_d> jphase: nope. a jquery plugin
[00:55:19] <jphase> gnu_d: what plugin?
[00:55:33] <gnu_d> jphase: pqgrid
[00:57:34] <jphase> and when you comment it out (and all the pqgrid calls) the error goes away?
[01:00:14] <Anes> Hi jQuery mates
[01:00:28] <Anes> i had a simple doubt
[01:01:05] <Anes> Aso;ooj: Using $.ajax call wit type as GET
[01:01:31] <Anes> Aso;ooj: in REST service
[01:02:07] <Anes> Aso;ooj : pass variable like username/password is securtiy issue?
[01:02:15] <doug65536> Anes: not if it is ssl
[01:02:34] <ioops> hello !
[01:02:44] <slax0r> security issue remains with POST as well...
[01:02:47] <doug65536> Anes: without SSL you are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack
[01:03:05] <slax0r> that you are in danger even with ssl ;)
[01:03:13] <Anes> doug :ioo;Aso: so to avoid it an y authentication help?
[01:03:50] <slax0r> call the rest service from the service, not the client, is a big step towards security
[01:04:03] <slax0r> because do you really trust your users so much that they wont get exploited?
[01:04:05] <ioops> I would like to make a cross platform app for mobile using snmp+wmi+sql(ms,postgresql,mysql). Is that possible ? should I take a look to api or webservices (php). Thank you !
[01:04:38] <Anes> Doug;slax: How that possible in REST?
[01:04:50] <doug65536> Anes: how is what possible
[01:05:00] <doug65536> Anes: authentication without encryption?
[01:05:01] <gnu_d> jphase: I managed get the right time where it's actually null, using a conitional breakpoint in firebug, I'm not analyzing the stack
[01:05:19] <gnu_d> s/I'm not/I'm now/
[01:05:50] <Anes> Aso;ooj: doug:slax: so i need to make my REST URLS all ssl right?
[01:06:10] <doug65536> Anes: using a nonce provided by the server, you can take the nonce and the user's creds on the client and build a strong cryptographic hash to prove to the server that the client knows the password. each request must use a different nonce, so you won't be vulnerable to a playback attack
[01:06:38] <doug65536> Anes: yes, make them all SSL and you will suffer a lot less
[01:07:00] <doug65536> Anes: it is cheaper to pay for ssl than the time you would spend dicking around with working around cleartext communication
[01:07:50] <Anes> dough: So make the REST URLS all ssl , I can pass username/password through ajax securely right?
[01:08:01] <doug65536> Anes: yes
[01:08:22] <Anes> dough: Thanks dear 1 more doubt
[01:08:47] <Anes> Dough: is OAuth2.0 protocol can replace ssl ?
[01:09:13] <slax0r> Anes: SSL and OAuth2.0 are 2 different things, so neither can replace the other
[01:09:48] <Anes> slax:Dough: so ssl is enough for 80% security right?
[01:10:15] <slax0r> More or less, yes
[01:10:30] <doug65536> Anes: the question is flawed. oauth uses ssl
[01:10:49] <Anes> slax;dough: So ssl is enough right?
[01:11:02] <slax0r> yes
[01:11:25] <doug65536> Anes: yes, ssl is extremely secure.
[01:12:19] <Anes> slax:Dough: Thanks dears so I just make my all REST URLs SSL is enough ok?
[01:12:25] <gnu_d> jphase: I found the error :).
[01:12:28] <doug65536> Anes: your computer verifies that the server is really the server it claims to be. the key exchange uses asymmetric encryption which is extremely strong.
[01:12:53] <Anes> slax:Dough: oh SSL do that right?
[01:12:59] <doug65536> Anes: yes
[01:13:21] <slax0r> doug65536: on a side now, ma MITM attacker might fire SSL-stripping between the client and the server, and all that SSL security goes to waste :)
[01:13:49] <slax0r> I've tried it once, I fished out the passwords for gmail and fb of all my familly members, ofcourse I told them later to change them :)
[01:13:59] <Anes> Slax;Dough: then what we need to do?
[01:14:09] <doug65536> slax0r: it won't work - the man in the middle can't sign its response, so the client will know it isn't really the server it claims to be
[01:15:17] <doug65536> if it weren't for the certificate authorities, asymmetric encryption is vulnerable to a man in the middle. but because the client can verify that the server knows the private key, by checking the signature, it is immune to man in the middle
[01:15:48] <slax0r> doug65536: Oh it works...because the ssl-stripping will 'change' all https connections to http connection for the client, even before the https is initiated in the first place, and the mitm will initiate the https connection to the server, sniffing all data inbetween
[01:16:22] <doug65536> slax0r: the client will fail to connect to it, because the MITM didn't respond with a properly signed response
[01:17:46] <Anes> slax:Dough: How to avoid MITM then?
[01:18:08] <doug65536> the client would have to completely connect to the MITM right? the client will reject the response because it can verify the signature. the man in the middle can't fool the client - it can't sign its responses
[01:18:11] <slax0r> you can't with a webapp
[01:18:23] <doug65536> Anes: yes you can
[01:18:32] <doug65536> how do you think banks do it?
[01:18:38] <slax0r> How on eart will a webapp prevent a MITM?
[01:18:39] <doug65536> you think you can MITM a bank? ya right
[01:18:53] <slax0r> earth*
[01:18:59] <Anes> doug65536: slax: pls tell a soution?
[01:19:19] <doug65536> slax0r: I told you already. you can't fool the client. the client can tell that you are a MITM because you can't sign your response correctly
[01:19:42] <slax0r> a MITM can't be *prevented* on a webapp, you can only do your best to try and protect your traffic from the client to your server
[01:19:50] <slax0r> a MITM has nothing to do with webapps
[01:20:16] <sunbeam> centerring a div with variable height vertically, whats the best JS code for this?
[01:20:24] <Anes> slax: doug: So SSL is enough dears?
[01:23:09] <slax0r> for the 4th time, yes, it will be enough
[01:23:27] <Anes> slax:doug: Thanks no more 5th time
[01:23:32] <slax0r> :)
[01:23:58] <Anes> slax:doug: may i take lunch happily :)
[01:29:06] <doitux_> hi, is it possible to close a jquery-mobile popup with data-rel="back" and also do some javascript action after closing via href="javascript:myAction();" ? It seems that myAction() is not called when i've set data-rel="back"
[01:32:28] <jphase> sunbeam: it depends on your styles really
[01:32:43] <sunbeam> jphase: responsive, variable height
[01:32:53] <jphase> sunbeam: relative elements?
[01:34:20] <jphase> you just need to do (parent height / 2 ) - (height / 2)
[01:34:24] <sunbeam> jphase: just a span inside a div that has a positioned absolute parent
[01:34:26] <jphase> with relative stuff
[01:34:37] <jphase> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/6yHsf/2/
[01:35:14] <jphase> now if you need to be exact, you need to also do + padding of parent container / 2
[01:35:25] <jphase> but that's a quick example
[01:35:40] <sunbeam> jphase: thanks but need solution for height in %
[01:36:48] <jphase> sunbeam: that works for % too
[01:37:02] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/6yHsf/3/
[01:37:36] <jphase> child elements can have any unit really
[01:38:26] <sunbeam> jphase: i mean the parent can be variable
[01:38:51] <jphase> well it still should work
[01:39:00] <jphase> it's just dividing everything by 2 and subtracting stuff really
[01:39:05] <jphase> so in theory, all the variables can change
[01:39:24] <jphase> if you take my fiddle, play with the parent height or the child heights it should still center
[01:40:49] <sunbeam> ok let me test
[01:45:12] <sunbeam> jphase: it sort of works
[01:45:34] <sunbeam> thanks
[01:45:47] <jphase> np
[01:45:50] <sunbeam> although even when I call it on a resize function it wont work :(
[01:46:06] <gnu_d> any tricks with the hash tag to fire some event, for instanced I got two tabs in my page if the page url is loaded with #tab1, to fire some event, can it be done withj query ?
[01:46:38] <sunbeam> jphase: the problem, is a jquery plugin i use resizes the parent items when page loads
[01:46:50] <sunbeam> jphase: so your code is probably executed before that
[01:47:14] <sunbeam> jphase: because you're right, it basically works
[01:47:56] <sunbeam> jphase: any idea what i could do about this?
[01:48:18] <jphase> sunbeam: the concept is there, but you'll basically need be sure things fire in the right order
[01:48:28] <jphase> so you have a jquery plugin to resize containers and such?
[01:48:50] <sunbeam> jphase: can i pm you link?
[01:49:17] <jphase> sure
[01:49:32] <jphase> gnu_d: hash tags wouldn't really fire events, you'd just want to bind the events to the anchors with the hash tag
[01:50:01] <jphase> gnu_d: you could have code execute based on what hash tag is in the URL on first page load as well
[01:50:03] <gnu_d> jphase: I found a solution, window.location.hash. if there is a value
[01:50:10] <gnu_d> :)
[01:50:26] <jphase> right
[02:12:25] <banzounet> Hey, guys how can I avoid the event mouseout to be triggered when I'm still inside the area? ( ex : http://jsfiddle.net/qub4N/ )
[02:12:53] <banzounet> When the mouse goes to the text, the event it triggered, how can I avoid this kind of behaviour?
[02:15:52] <banzounet> Look like I've to use mouseenter/mouseleave
[02:16:53] <doug65536> banzounet: I think that' event bubbling
[02:21:11] <doug65536> banzounet: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qub4N/2/
[02:23:07] <x-finite> i am using this to check if the date entered is valid for example if someone selects the 31st of september or 29th of february (on a non leap year) then an error will be thrown http://pastebin.com/KDehifK3
[02:23:23] <x-finite> its working okay, but some comments on these codes will be appreciated
[02:24:03] <doug65536> x-finite: don't repeatedly call val. you should read those things into variables and check the variables
[02:24:18] <x-finite> noted and?
[02:26:34] <doug65536> x-finite: leap centuries have 28 days in february
[02:27:38] <x-finite> assuming my codes will be used for generations, i'll put in the checks :)
[02:29:54] <doug65536> x-finite: your code will accept january 32 right?
[02:30:37] <doug65536> or january 10000
[02:30:57] <x-finite> no actually these are select boxes
[02:31:14] <x-finite> populated till 31 days
[02:32:39] <doug65536> x-finite: it would have been easier to throw the date at new Date() and check that it matches

[04:06:01] <Kambfhase> Sometimes I wish to myself that JavaScript was based on a reasonable, logical language. Hence not English.
[04:09:03] <HenryCH> How can I make any changes to an input field (whether through mouse click selection or typed in) be reflected in another input in real time?
[04:09:16] <HenryCH> I've tried .change() but that only updates when the element isn't in focus
[04:09:43] <HenryCH> .keypress or .keyup wouldn't work with mouse selections right?
[04:24:46] <T13|sleeps> Thanks doug65536
[04:27:31] <grafi> HenryCH just trigger some special event when a user selects something or types something in
[04:28:13] <grafi> then listen for that event and get the changes to the other input
[04:29:07] <Davy> hi guys, i got this form where i need a total. Some of the values are radio buttons. When i try and select a value but when i click another option it adds it instead of replacing the value. No clue about Jquery so i'm thinking im overthinking it but can't find it.. http://jsfiddle.net/XVnHu/
[04:29:34] <HenryCH> hm, don't know how I would do that, I'll go read about it
[04:32:17] <Kambfhase> Davy: So basically, you just have three options, 0, 24 and 32?
[04:32:50] <Davy> well there are more radio groups and a select. The select works fine but the radio groups keep adding instead of replacing the value for each group
[04:32:54] <Davy> don't know if i make any sense
[04:33:32] <Davy> the vals are given by php (thats why they are declared first) but there are more than those. If i get one group to work, the rest shouldn't be a problem
[04:33:36] <Kambfhase> Let me guess, BaseTotal is also change by these other options?
[04:33:41] <Davy> yup
[04:34:19] <HenryCH> couldn't you use prevall?
[04:34:33] <Davy> no clue what my options are with jquery
[04:34:35] <Kambfhase> Ok, I'll try my best
[04:34:54] <Davy> tried a .change( ... each() ) but didn't work
[04:35:22] <Davy> now i was trying to add flags to see if one of the options was selected to get ride of it but doesn't work and doesn't look very pretty aswell
[04:37:21] <Kambfhase> You are trying to hard ;)
[04:37:35] <Davy> i thought so..
[04:38:18] <grafi> HenryCH http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/kdHFh/ like this
[04:40:39] <HenryCH> I see, thanks, this was for a date input so let me see if it works
[04:46:06] <Kambfhase> Davy: http://jsfiddle.net/XVnHu/3/
[04:47:12] <Davy> cool, looks alot nicer than my "sollution" :p
[04:47:47] <Kambfhase> :D
[04:48:32] <Kambfhase> btw, `Pas sélectionner` has a wrong `for` attribute
[04:49:01] <Davy> can i ask what part replaces the value
[04:49:05] <Davy> so i get what you did
[04:50:53] <Kambfhase> I dont do any subtraction, i just copy the BaseTotal and add whatever packaging(?) i want
[04:51:21] <Davy> right
[04:51:25] <Davy> thanks alot man
[04:53:48] <Kambfhase> np
[05:14:38] <starfox21> how can I pass in extra arguments to the handlerIn and handlerOut callbacks of .hover?
[05:15:34] <Kambfhase> I guess you have to use .on('mouseenter', fn, arg) instead
[05:17:44] <Davy> Kambfhase: it works great but when i add it with the checkbox (with another value to add / substract) it goes wrong. Scenario: i select responsalilité and formule base. Then i deselect responabilité and it gets reset to 0 instead of the value of formule base http://jsfiddle.net/XVnHu/4/
[05:19:37] <Kambfhase> mkay, let me think this trough.
[05:25:48] <Kambfhase> Davy: how do you lke this? This is even easier to exent for more form buttons. http://jsfiddle.net/XVnHu/6/
[05:25:58] <aro> with bootstrap is it possible to animate a popover across the page
[05:27:36] <Davy> Kambfhase: nice! think thats the one. Gonna test that out right now
[05:41:14] <doug65536> starfox21: a closure
[05:45:49] <Davy> just to inform that Kambfhase is the man! Kudos
[05:45:57] <Kambfhase> :)
[05:58:05] <Davy> Kambfhase: is there a difference in IE10 and FF? works fine in FF but not in IE10 (surprize..)
[06:06:32] <Kambfhase> Davy: do you get an error message?
[06:06:51] <Davy> nope, nothing at all. and no 0.00 to start with neithrr
[06:07:49] <Kambfhase> That is weird. I dont have IE, so I cant test that
[06:08:38] <doug65536> Davy: link?
[06:09:38] <T13|sleeps> Does ie have an error console?

[06:20:30] <raj> a user has selected an option in a dropdown. When I then clone the parent container and append it elsewhere, the select option is lost. How can I prevent this?
[06:20:49] <jop008> how do I update a date field?
[06:21:03] <jop008> now I use .val ("datestring")
[06:21:13] <jop008> but the date is not set
[06:21:40] <raj> jop008, what's a date field?
[06:21:59] <jop008> <input type=date
[06:22:02] <jop008> like this
[06:23:11] <jop008> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/606463/jquery-datepicker-set-selected-date-on-the-fly
[06:23:39] <raj> oh wow, didn't even know that input type existed
[06:23:50] <AlexanderBB10> huh
[06:23:53] <AlexanderBB10> what is this: Uncaught ReferenceError: finishAjax is not defined
[06:23:59] <AlexanderBB10> never had this problem before
[06:24:20] <raj> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16889933/set-the-value-of-input-type-date-in-javascript
[06:24:25] <raj> jop008, ^^
[06:24:51] <raj> you need to set it with a Date type object
[06:25:17] <raj> so `var mydate = Date.parse('datestring')`
[06:25:24] <raj> and then .val(mydate)
[06:31:46] <soee> what would be the best way to do some action after link i clicked and than move to this link value ?
[06:42:43] <raj> soee, not understanding the question
[06:45:39] <soee> how can i check if clicked element is a link ('a' tag)
[06:45:49] <doug65536> soee: you mean, do something, then go to the page specified in the link?
[06:46:29] <soee> doug65536, this i have already. now on click() i have to know what element it was
[06:46:54] <doug65536> soee: $(this).is('a') is one way
[06:46:54] <raj> soee, $('.clicked-element').on('click', function(ev) { $(ev.target).prop('tagName')
[06:47:13] <raj> it'll always be capitalized
[06:47:16] <raj> btw
[06:52:40] <sammich> this.tagName
[07:07:55] <jop008> Still not getting it to work I have a date field and wnat to set an input by using .val but how to set a date?
[07:08:36] <doug65536> jop008: same way, but you need to format it
[07:09:07] <jop008> I think this is the issue $('#datejq').datepicker('refresh');
[07:09:47] <doug65536> jop008: you didn't mention datepicker
[07:10:37] <jop008> I have a data field on mobile so this is not the same as having a datepicker
[07:11:47] <jop008> now having this var odate = new Date( getDateFromFormat( cfield.substring (0,10),"yyyy-MM-dd")  );  $formfield.val (odate.getMonth()+"/"+odate.getDate()+"/"+odate.getFullYear()); $formfield..datepicker('refresh');
[07:11:53] <jop008> but no success
[07:12:08] <jop008> the date is a valid date I tested it
[07:13:18] <jop008> formfield is the input field
[07:13:44] <doug65536> jop008: it's a jquery ui datepicker? or what
[07:13:56] <sammich> I don't think I had this many formatting issues with the datepicker
[07:14:15] <jop008> standad <input type = date on jQM
[07:14:16] <sammich> store the date as the ISO format
[07:14:34] <sammich> but use the alt-format to show whatever you need it to
[07:14:44] <doug65536> jop008: ?
[07:14:53] <sammich> datepicker should just take in a date object for display
[07:15:05] <jop008> my odate holds a valid date object
[07:15:20] <sammich> did you give us a fiddle?
[07:15:58] <doug65536> jop008: you know there is more than one datepicker right?
[07:17:52] <jop008> I tried to make one but it fails it doesn't show the input field properly http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/36/
[07:18:35] <jop008> dough I want <input type=date nothing more
[07:18:49] <sammich> cookie though?
[07:18:57] <sammich> baking though?
[07:19:49] <sammich> oh wow, is that datepicker still in jQM
[07:20:30] <doug65536> there is no datepicker mentioned in the jquery mobile docs
[07:20:38] <sammich> yeah, they got rid of it
[07:20:59] <sammich> it's an external plugin now, no idea if it's still an active plugin though
[07:21:06] <spreadsheet> how do websites make those features that change elements depending on the position of where the user is at? for example, a header bar that changes as you scroll down, like USA Today's website; a side thing that goes from fixed positioning and then "attaches" again when you reach the edge of a section; a fixed index on the side that can track where you are in the document; backgrounds that scroll with the content but not quite
[07:21:20] <sammich> jop008: jQM 1.4 is coming out soon
[07:21:47] <spreadsheet> tldr: what in jquery allows you to know where the browser is at in a document?
[07:22:13] <doug65536> spreadsheet: they are mostly based on getting 'scroll' events, and to make things stay where they are, they switch the element to position: 'fixed'
[07:22:14] <jop008> I am using 1.32
[07:22:21] <sammich> spreadsheet: many ways, I can think of some but not sure if they're the best
[07:22:23] <spreadsheet> thanks
[07:22:50] <jop008> My site is big and I want not to work with a moving target. Testing takes a lot of time
[07:22:52] <spreadsheet> I looked at it in the API and that seemed to be one that stuck out to me
[07:23:03] <sammich> you'd then have to check your elements to see what's in view, then update that contents view to show your current section
[07:23:06] <jop008> and with a new jqM I can test all over again
[07:23:07] <spreadsheet> but I didn't quite know for sure if it was for that
[07:23:24] <jop008> So no date tips?
[07:24:05] <doug65536> jop008: the code you posted is fine
[07:24:17] <jop008> but no date picker there
[07:24:29] <doug65536> jop008: although, I don't know where getDateFromFormat comes from
[07:24:30] <jop008> so not the same as my site
[07:24:43] <jop008> okay a lib call
[07:24:50] <jop008> and this one is missing there
[07:24:58] <jop008> so code is incomplet
[07:25:00] <sammich> all yours, Im out
[07:25:28] <doug65536> jop008: you are all over the place. is it a plain html input type=date field or not? is there a plugin involved or not? where does the date come from? the user? or what?
[07:26:55] <jop008> no the fiddle was fine
[07:27:10] <jop008> plain vanilla nput date
[07:27:21] <jop008> mo plugins
[07:27:43] <jop008> no plugins
[07:28:07] <jop008> I have a valid date object but how to use that when setting an input field
[07:28:18] <doug65536> jop008: if you have a date object that is correct, then "$formfield.val (odate.getMonth()+"/"+odate.getDate()+"/"+odate.getFullYear())" should work fine
[07:28:40] <jop008> okay
[07:29:07] <doug65536> jop008: actually, try - instead of /
[07:29:48] <jop008> no refresh needed?
[07:30:52] <doug65536> jop008: not sure
[07:31:19] <jop008> odate on the console => Wed Sep 11 2013 16:30:49 GMT+0200 (CEST)
[07:31:28] <jop008> so a valid date
[07:31:53] <doug65536> ah wait
[07:32:00] <doug65536> set it with year-month-day
[07:32:14] <doug65536> I think html5 requires it to be in RFC3339 format
[07:33:34] <doug65536> also, the Date object month is zero based
[07:36:05] <jop008> I tried this  $formfield.val ( odate.toISOString() ); but no way
[07:37:04] <raj> .isoformat()
[07:37:25] <jop008> but is the same?
[07:37:34] <raj> is what the same?
[07:37:37] <raj> sorry, I haven't been following
[07:38:21] <jop008> .isoformat and toisostring
[07:39:01] <raj> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12844902/converting-date-and-time-to-iso-format-in-javascript
[07:39:39] <raj> so I was wrong
[07:39:43] <raj> it's toISOString
[07:41:59] <jop008> I use this .val ( 8/11/2013")
[07:42:00] <jop008> but no success
[07:42:11] <doug65536> jop008: year-month-day
[07:42:32] <jop008> so the string is wrong formaatted
[07:43:10] <jop008> ("yyyy-mm-dd")
[07:43:21] <jop008> this format as input to .val ()?
[07:44:26] <jop008> Must I add a month since zero based?
[07:45:14] <doug65536> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/NgLcG/9/
[07:46:20] <jop008> thx
[07:47:15] <doug65536> jop008: something more reusable http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/NgLcG/11/
[07:49:26] <doug65536> jop008: or as a jquery plugin http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/NgLcG/13/
[07:49:39] <jop008> first trial 1
[07:49:52] <mdev> why did newer jquery drop support for older IE?
[07:49:57] <mdev> what sense does that make
[07:50:05] <doug65536> mdev: because it was ruining performance
[07:50:13] <doug65536> mdev: and bloating it
[07:50:21] <jop008> Great  it worked!!!!!!
[07:50:25] <mdev> why? to ruin performance one would have to use an old browser to begin wtih
[07:50:32] <mdev> otherwise why would new browser users care
[07:50:49] <jop008> So if I migrate to 1.4 IE gets dropped?
[07:50:51] <doug65536> mdev: they were crippled, they were unable to use proper functions that real browsers support
[07:51:27] <doug65536> mdev: so instead of calling native, fast stuff that proper browsers have, they had to "manually" do things with piles of js
[07:52:24] <mdev> is a scary prescedant though, that Jquery authors are willing to just drop old browsers, vs taking a more professional approach like seperating the features
[07:52:41] <doug65536> mdev: they didn't drop anything. 1.x is still being developed
[07:52:44] <mdev> jquery-legacy.js that just includes support for old browsers and jquery normal
[07:53:48] <mdev> doug oh ok
[07:53:55] <bobbytek> How can I prevent chrome web tools from sending Cache-Control:max-age=0 when it is open?
[07:54:04] <bobbytek> Sorry, I know unrelated!
[07:54:06] <mdev> btw I think some jquery plugins should be included by default
[07:54:11] <bobbytek> But it is driving me nuts!
[07:54:14] <mdev> like the resize one for divs
[07:54:26] <bobbytek> Figured one of you smart folks might know :)
[07:54:38] <mdev> included into the main code that is
[07:54:40] <doug65536> mdev: is it that hard to add a script tag for it? I don't use or want that plugin
[07:55:04] <mdev> it's yet another file the browser has to download
[07:55:17] <doug65536> mdev: jquery is extremely extensible for exactly that reason. people ask for all sorts of extended functionality, and you can have it, with plugins
[07:55:20] <mdev> and if you didn't want to use that feature you could simply not specify a callback for a resize on a div
[07:55:49] <mdev> doug sure, but some stuff should already be in there, instead of having to scour the net looking to why the code isn't working
[07:55:55] <mdev> and then if a plugin exist that fixes it
[07:55:56] <doug65536> mdev: yeah, and if they added everything that everybody wanted, jquery would be 1MB of js
[07:56:18] <mdev> not saying *everything, just things that make sense, other companies do it all the time
[07:56:36] <mdev> if a good third party feature/plugin is made and it should be in the core, they integrate
[07:56:56] <mdev> imagine if php took this download plugin for every little useful feature approach, it'd be miserable
[07:56:57] <doug65536> bobbytek: what's wrong with max-age=0?
[07:57:10] <mdev> right the gate awesome, is awesome, just saying...
[07:57:21] <bobbytek> doug65536, It by passes the cache
[07:57:36] <bobbytek> I want to have the developer tools open and use a warm cache
[07:57:54] <bobbytek> it is affecting what is being observed when I didn't ask it to
[07:58:02] <doug65536> bobbytek: you enabled that. it is in the debugger options
[07:58:12] <bobbytek> doug65536, no I didn't and no it's not
[07:58:18] <bobbytek> that's the no-cache option
[07:58:30] <bobbytek> not the Cache-Control:max-age=0 option, which doesn't exist
[07:59:03] <doug65536> bobbytek: how are you testing it? with refresh? refresh forces it to reread
[08:01:35] <bobbytek> doug65536, I'm pressing reload on the browser (or ctrl+r)
[08:01:54] <bobbytek> I have verified that the behavior is different by using whatheaders.com
[08:01:55] <doug65536> bobbytek: and that's why it is sending that. reload forces it to re-download
[08:02:13] <doug65536> try a link or focus the address bar and hit enter
[08:02:18] <bobbytek> doug65536, So reloading a page always forces a max-age=0?
[08:02:33] <bobbytek> That doesn't make any sense
[08:02:45] <doug65536> bobbytek: it makes perfect sense
[08:02:51] <bobbytek> That would mean a cache is useless across visits
[08:03:06] <doug65536> bobbytek: you press refresh to visit a site?
[08:03:33] <sebsen> hi, how can i find out if my css-element has position: fixed ?
[08:03:35] <doug65536> s/refresh/reload/
[08:03:51] <doug65536> sebsen: element.css('position')
[08:03:55] <sebsen> ty
[08:04:33] <bobbytek> window.location.reload(true) != window.location.reload(false)
[08:04:48] <doug65536> bobbytek: what are you talking about
[08:04:54] <bobbytek> "By default, the reload() method reloads from the cache, but by you can force the the reload to get the page from server by setting the forceGet parameter to true."
[08:05:09] <bobbytek> reload should use the cache is my point
[08:05:55] <bobbytek> anyways, simple test: navigate to http://whatheaders.com/ and note the headers
[08:06:14] <bobbytek> now open chrome and navigate to that url
[08:06:22] <bobbytek> chrome dev tools i mean
[08:06:23] <doug65536> bobbytek: no max-age here
[08:06:27] <bobbytek> and note the headers
[08:07:08] <doug65536> bobbytek: nope
[08:07:27] <doug65536> bobbytek: GET and the User-Agent line
[08:07:35] <bobbytek> interesting, I do get it
[08:07:42] <bobbytek> What version of chrome are you using?
[08:07:58] <doug65536> bobbytek: you are pressing reload. instead click in the address bar and hit enter
[08:08:45] <doug65536> bobbytek: ok now I get it
[08:09:28] <doug65536> bobbytek: max-age doesn't mean 'no-cache', it means, "hey proxies/caches, make sure this is the latest, I have one from date X"
[08:10:12] <doug65536> bobbytek: although, I don't see any if-modified-since
[08:10:24] <doug65536> bobbytek: I think devtools affects its behavior
[08:10:28] <raj> I can't believe cloning doesn't clone the select's value
[08:10:31] <raj> that crazy
[08:10:32] <bobbytek>  if-modified-since only works if last-modified was set
[08:10:51] <bobbytek> only gets sent
[08:10:54] <doug65536> bobbytek: meaning, it isn't caching the main page at all
[08:11:28] <bobbytek> doug65536, not on whatheaders, but my site does send these
[08:12:21] <doug65536> bobbytek: does send what? expires? or max-age
[08:12:45] <doug65536> I mean, an expiry date or a max age
[08:13:12] <bobbytek> max-age
[08:14:00] <doug65536> bobbytek: I think having dev tools open influences it. try the same thing in FF's built-in debugger (NOT firebug). you will see it caching as expected
[08:14:51] <bobbytek> doug65536, ya, its very strange and effects what I'm trying to test (page load time)
[08:15:17] <bobbytek> Although I can't find much on google on the topic
[08:15:21] <doug65536> bobbytek: try FF's built in dev tools, they are great for diagnosing that stuff
[08:15:51] <doug65536> bobbytek: practically identical capabilities as chrome in that respect
[08:16:28] <bobbytek> doug65536, ok will do. I appreciate you helping me with this. Much thanks :)
[08:16:39] <bobbytek> And sorry #jquery for taking this channel hostage :)
[08:17:01] <doug65536> bobbytek: yeah, this channel isn't full of topic cops like some channels :)
[08:22:43] <Terminus> hello. how do i set border color in jqueryui's animate()? i've tried http://paste.ofcode.org/32cME4aLjXsWbMfu27yksfj but it didn't work. what i really want to do is stop it from setting a border in the first place.
[08:26:33] <doug65536> Terminus: if you don't want it to animate the border, don't mention the border in the animate call
[08:27:55] <doug65536> Terminus: what do you mean "setting the border". you want to get rid of the border completely? what does that have to do with animate?
[08:28:08] <Terminus> doug65536: i started without any border properties at all but i noticed a 1px wide border being made when it animates.
[08:28:28] <Terminus> the border that was being made was the same color as the backgroundColor i set.
[08:28:38] <Terminus> let me recheck this with the inspector.
[08:31:05] <Terminus> doug65536: whoops... it seems i was looking at the wrong thing. my <li> height exceeds that of the <ul> it is in and causes the background to be bigger when animated. >_<
[08:34:20] <doug65536> Terminus: ah ok
[08:38:40] <ravenzz> let's say I have $(document).on('focus', '[type="text"]', fn); is there any way to get the target selector within fn?
[08:43:25] <scar> if i have a UL with rows of 5 LI's a piece, all thumbnails. i want X to load directly, and when someone scrolls to the end, i want it to keep loading more. what is the best method to use to achieve this?
[08:51:22] <raj> scar, there are jquery plugins that do that
[08:51:27] <leo_33> in your opinion can someone who is morbidly obese find a partner?
[08:51:54] <raj> scar, such as the jquery waypoint plugin
[08:52:03] <scar> how to feed it though?
[08:52:04] <scar> hrm
[08:52:34] <raj> haven't used waypoint to do that yet
[08:52:51] <leo_33> in your opinion can someone who is morbidly obese find a partner?
[08:52:55] <raj> but I'm sure it's just a callback to to hitting the waypoint, and in the callback you do an ajax call
[08:53:14] <raj> leo_33, yes, another morbidly obese person
[08:53:19] <leo_33> ok
[08:53:25] <raj> check out obesesingles.com
[08:54:12] <leo_33> i am not morbid yet.
[08:54:20] <raj> what's your bmi?
[08:55:11] <leo_33> wait ill calculate
[08:55:21] <leo_33> 36.3
[08:59:15] <scar> if i var foo = 'test'; say in the <head></head>, how can i change that var later on? i've tried numerous things within on click events, doing var foo = 'changed'; or foo = 'changed'; or even creating a function that changes the var. any ideaas? lol im sure this is somethinge easy
[09:02:09] <juboba> I've been checking google closure and got nausea with all the java-like approach in their code. Wasting much of javascript built-in characteristics. But they have something interesting: I can build a whole application without writing a single line of HTML, all elements can be created from javascript. Is it possible to do this with jQuery?
[09:07:09] <FlashySlash> Hello, can anyone recommend me some script that will add gaussian blur on image/div object ?
[09:17:18] <dopte> does anyone know how I can find the item that is currently focused, using jquery?
[09:19:57] <lolmaus> How do i download/cache an image without displaying it, so that when an <img> element is created, the image is displayed immediately?
[09:20:11] <shoky> dopte:  document.activeElement
[09:21:43] <dopte> thanks shoky. and can i wrap that around and do something like $(document.activeElement).next('a').focus(); ?
[09:21:51] <sfz> lolmaus: if (document.images) { var img = new Image(); img.src = 'foo.jpg'; }
[09:22:19] <shoky> dopte: yes.  but that will only work if the direct next element is an <a>
[09:23:09] <dopte> shoky: you're right, it doesn't seem to work in my case. Any idea what I could do if there's other elements before the first following <a> ?
[09:23:21] <lolmaus> lolmaus, thank you. ^_^
[09:23:44] <shoky> dopte: you could do .nextAll('a').first()   if the <a> is one of the next siblings
[09:24:03] <shoky> dopte: either way i'd console.log(document.activeElement) to see you're getting what you're expecting
[09:24:22] * jphase wonders why he doesn't hardly use .nextAll and re-evaluates his life
[09:25:05] <jphase> shoky: is the main difference between .nextAll and .siblings is that .nextAll only the ones after the current selector?
[09:25:42] <shoky> jphase: yeah
[09:25:44] <jphase> less things to loop through that way, I like that
[09:26:16] <shoky> there's also .nextUntil which is sometimes useful
[09:26:45] <jphase> hmm, so I guess that implies .nextAll can match > 1 DOM elements
[09:26:58] <shoky> yep
[09:27:04] <dopte> shoky: not sure what you mean by next siblings. I have something like this: <ul><li><a>FOCUSED</a></li><li><a>want_to_focus</a></li></ul>
[09:27:15] <dopte> but nextall isn't working..
[09:27:21] <shoky> dopte: siblings have the same parent
[09:27:30] <shoky> dopte: in your case the FOCUSED <a> has no sibling
[09:27:37] <dopte> ah, they're not siblings in my case than
[09:27:42] <shoky> so next/nextAll etc won't work
[09:28:18] <shoky> could do something like  .closest('li').next().children('a')
[09:29:12] <juboba> I've been checking google closure and got nausea with all the java-like approach in their code. Wasting much of javascript built-in characteristics. But they have something interesting: I can build a whole application without writing a single line of HTML, all elements can be created from javascript. Is it possible to do this with jQuery?
[09:29:26] <dopte> shoky: thanks, i'll give that a try
[09:30:45] <dopte> that works, awesome!
[09:30:47] <jphase> juboba: Sure, jQuery could be used to write a DOM parser. Often times folks that use ajax functions in jQuery build out DOM elements from arrays and objects, it'd be similar
[09:44:16] <Mrgoose2> With Jquery Mobile is it possible to make the side panel independently scroll?  I have a menu in my slide panel and i need to be able to scroll up and down
[09:45:39] <jphase> Mrgoose2: Sounds like it'd be done with CSS, perhaps making something position: fixed and/or overflow: scroll depending on what your definition of "scroll up and down" means
[09:46:47] <jphase> man, I wish there was an easy way to find exactly where the function name 'blah' comes from... I guess I'll have to use wget and grep through the contents :{
[09:49:51] <jphase> man wget is unfairly dope, idk how people go without a linux terminal
[09:50:15] <pixelpimp> jphase: open chrome dev tools, hit ctrl+shift+f to search all scripts
[09:50:24] <jphase> oh???
[09:50:28] <FiSHNUGGET> Does anyone know why I can't capture a scroll event of an iframe?  The src is same domain, but I can't seem to capture the scrolling.  The content containing the iframe is loaded dynamically however.
[09:50:46] <pixelpimp> can also use regexp
[09:50:55] <jphase> pixelpimp: hmm, makes my mac go into fullscreen, but good to know there's something in chrome like that
[09:51:01] <jphase> I'll look it up'
[09:51:21] <pixelpimp> i don't know where the option is to open it without the keyboard :P
[09:51:43] <pixelpimp> there is a shortcuts menu in the bottom right gear box
[09:51:48] <jphase> well it probably just means it's a different keyboard shortcut for Mac Lion and up cause I think that's the universal fullscreen command
[09:51:57] <pixelpimp> "search across all sources"
[09:52:18] <jphase> hmm, I don't have that :(
[09:52:37] <pixelpimp> are you in the inspector?
[09:53:12] <pixelpimp> i've never used chrome on a mac; not sure how different it is
[09:53:31] <jphase> normally it's the same and ctrl becomes cmd
[09:54:10] <jphase> ahhh
[09:54:17] <jphase> cmd + option + f in mac apparently
[09:54:19] <jphase> dope!
[09:54:21] <jphase> thx
[09:54:34] <pixelpimp> no problem
[09:56:46] <jphase> man, this would've been handy to know about 5 years ago
[10:00:02] <scar> i have a memegen that uses $('<img>').load() -- why <img> ? and how can i call this again without firing all images?
[10:02:25] <jphase> scar: $('<img>') will dynamically build a img tag for you to insert onto the page
[10:03:05] <jphase> the .load is either an alias for .on('load') (wait until content in selector is loaded) or to load external resources like $('div').load('http://google.com input');
[10:03:31] <dblosevn> Hey, is there a simple way to make the first chekbox in a check group readonly in jqm? I tried readonly="readonly" and it didnt work :-(
[10:03:36] <jphase> scar: depends on which way you're using load to answer your second question
[10:04:20] <jphase> dblosevn: readonly?  like disabled="disabled"
[10:04:21] <jphase> ?
[10:04:39] <dblosevn> im trying disabled but I dont want it to gray it out, not sure if it will or not
[10:04:41] <jphase> or will that not work? disabled elements won't send in a form post I don't believe
[10:05:04] <dblosevn> its not a form
[10:05:12] <dblosevn> and disabled didnt work either
[10:05:13] <jphase> hmm I'm not sure about a jquery mobile css class that does that for you (there may be one), but I usually just do it with jQuery
[10:05:28] <dblosevn> can still change the value
[10:05:35] <jphase> .css('opacity', .5) for the style
[10:05:36] <jphase> odd
[10:05:47] <jphase> jqm must not care about disabled...
[10:05:59] <dblosevn> docs say it does
[10:06:10] <dblosevn> dont know if it will read the meta data for it though
[10:06:44] <dblosevn> maybe... $("input[type='checkbox']:eq(0)").checkboxradio('disable');
[10:07:13] <jphase> perhaps, whatever methods they provide for disabling would probably be the way to go
[10:07:30] <jphase> clearly doing it before the element is rendered doesn't matter so they probably provide something like that
[10:08:20] <dblosevn> doing that disabled it
[10:08:21] <jphase> dblosevn: either that or you can set it as readonly="readonly" and then just do something like $(':checkbox[readonly=readonly]').click(function(){ return false; });
[10:08:26] <dblosevn> but it grayed it out :-(
[10:08:34] <scar> jphase, $('<img>').load()
[10:09:10] <jphase> scar: if your code is literally just like that, then I don't understand the application of .load()
[10:09:27] <jphase> .load(function(){ maybe....
[10:09:56] <jphase> but even then, a dynamic <img> tag without any attributes will load quicker than most people will get to notice, so even that wouldn't make sense really
[10:10:12] <scar> jphase, yes yes, .load(function() {
[10:10:32] <scar> jphase, i found a tut online for a simple memegen, and it lets you select an image to use as the meme bg. well i want to be able to change that. jas :
[10:11:26] <scar> jphase, http://pastebin.com/fGh3Jgfk
[10:12:29] <jphase> scar: that .load function should only be applied to that $('<img>') tag that you're creating, not to all images
[10:12:55] <jphase> $('img') = all images, $('<img>') = create a <img> tag as a jQuery DOM object in memory
[10:13:02] <jphase> i.e.
[10:13:05] <jphase> $('<img>').prop('src', 'http://placekitten.com/100/100').load(function(){ alert('I just loaded'); }).appendTo('body');
[10:13:13] <scar> jphase, ahh, so i should estroy the canvas, recreate the canvas then do it again?
[10:13:26] <scar> because is this script adding elements inside the canvas?
[10:14:01] <jphase> if you're having troubles with when the load event is firing then yeah I'd start with that
[10:14:29] <scar> well, im trying to determine how it works. .mr_memegen_canvas is a canvas, obviously
[10:14:31] <jphase> recreating the <img> elements will insure that the event fires as you'd expect I would think
[10:14:39] <scar> i cant find an img in chrome dev inspec
[10:14:51] <dblosevn> jQuery("input[type='checkbox']:eq(0)", app.jqscope).checkboxradio('disable');jQuery('.ui-disabled', app.jqscope).removeClass('ui-disabled'); seemed to work
[10:14:52] <scar> everythings working, but im trying to replace the image being used.
[10:15:19] <jphase> oh k
[10:15:27] <scar> so, do i need to destroy image and rebuild?
[10:15:38] <scar> im trying to see how the heck its placing the image in the canvas
[10:15:52] <jphase> scar: that's the bottom part
[10:15:53] <scar> ahh
[10:15:55] <scar> the drawimage
[10:15:57] <jphase> they're creating a new image
[10:15:59] <jphase> in javascript
[10:16:01] <scar> ctx.drawImage( img, 0, 0 );
[10:16:03] <scar> so basically,
[10:16:14] <jphase> that's where they add the meme onto the image yeah
[10:16:16] <scar> how do i destroy, and re-create this iamge?
[10:16:20] <scar> in the same canvas?
[10:16:35] <scar> do i need  to destroy the canvas then append a new one, or do i just need to reset it, etc?
[10:16:41] <jphase> some of that depends on the markup it creates
[10:17:10] <jphase> does it create a <canvas> element? If so are they doing something funky like turning <img> tag into a container? </img>
[10:17:20] <scar> no no it's not
[10:17:31] <scar> the canvas is there in html, and the js is drawing onto it
[10:17:39] <jphase> then you could remove the canvas element yeah
[10:17:47] <scar> or should i just clear the canvas
[10:17:48] <jphase> and then call their drawImage function again
[10:18:01] <jphase> and change their .src to whatever bg image you want I suppose
[10:18:16] <jphase> but you'd need to remove the image itself too
[10:18:29] <jphase> looks like they create the image, and then draw on a canvas as well relating to that image
[10:18:31] <scar> if i had a list of thumbnails that provided an actual img src path, can i have an on click trigger that image, pull the new SRC to use and then rebuild the same .load(function() i have? or does that only work on pagelod?
[10:18:38] <scar> yeah
[10:18:45] <jphase> sure
[10:18:50] <scar> hm
[10:19:07] <scar> so i dont need to destroy the canvas?
[10:19:25] <jphase> it really depends on how the markup is done so I can't tell you for sure yes or no
[10:19:45] <jphase> but I would imagine yes
[10:23:41] <juboba> jphase, is there a plugin to do this easier?
[10:24:53] <jphase> juboba: idk but it'd be pretty easy to make this on your own so I'm not sure if someone would write a full plugin for it per sé
[10:25:21] <jphase> juboba: you could also just build an HTML string and use $.parseHTML to do this, it really depends on how you're building your DOM objects
[10:27:16] <juboba> jphase, Oh, I didn't want to do that. I already create elements with <div/> syntax. But I was wondering if there was a way of not having to write multiline html in a js string.
[10:28:46] <jphase> juboba: you could write your own function for this if you wanted... like with an array of objects where the object key is the the HTML tag you want to build and it has an attributes value that's another object type thing
[10:29:32] <jphase> hard to say without knowing what you're trying to use it for exactly... a bit too broad to give you a definitive answer
[10:32:19] <jphase> juboba: if you had something like:   var domElements = [{type: '<img>', attributes: {src: 'someimage.jpg', 'id': 'myimg'}},{type: '<div>', attributes: {src: 'someimage.jpg', 'id': 'myimg'}}];
[10:32:49] <jphase> then you could loop through it and build elements based on that, but I'm not sure how much easier that is than just building HTML, it just depends on what you're trying to accomplish
[10:32:56] <juboba> jphase, you're damn right!
[10:33:00] <juboba> of course!
[10:33:02] <juboba> thanks!
[10:33:05] <jphase> np ;)
[10:33:26] <juboba> and I can even put in the array the parent if I want to nest them
[10:33:27] <jphase> also if you're really doing this the right way, I'd suggest have a children: [{}]  array of objects too
[10:33:29] <jphase> or something
[10:33:31] <jphase> yeah
[10:33:39] <jphase> exactly
[10:33:40] <juboba> nice
[10:33:42] <juboba> :P
[10:33:47] <juboba> I'll write a plugin
[10:33:48] <juboba> :P
[10:33:54] <juboba> I know people could use this
[10:34:29] * jphase gets distracted about how much a an empty object inside an empty array looks like an ascii vagina..... [{}]
[10:39:50] <jphase> it'd be kinda cool to make a PHP class (or whatever server-side language) that would let you build out the JSON object you'd use for that plugin too juboba, since building DOM elements based on data is used so often
[10:42:43] <jphase> and to do the parsing function correctly it'll probably have to be an optionally recursive function based on whether the length of the children is > 0
[10:42:49] <jphase> </rant>
[10:45:56] <d21> hi. how can i autoclick using jquery such link 'href="javascript:clickMenu('hide_menu');'?
[10:46:58] <jphase> d21: not sure what you mean by autoclick...    if you had a linke like <a id="mylink" href="#">click me</a> then you can use $('#mylink').click(function(){ clickMenu('hide_menu'); });
[10:47:27] <d21> thing is that there is no id
[10:48:29] <d21> seems i got it working, thanks :)
[10:52:17] <juboba> jphase, I already have something like that. I build a tree in a json fashion and then in the view I parse it with a really small function and build the tree
[11:14:41] <Deas> any php-wizards in here? http://pastebin.com/2hJ18bzq -> wont give return $x;
[11:15:11] <jphase> then ($q/$x) must not equal 220
[11:15:43] <pixelpimp> Deas: missing return on your else
[11:15:54] <pixelpimp> else return getXfromPackage
[11:17:28] <Deas> p pixelpimp: intressting. thanks.
[11:18:44] <doug65536> Deas: dude
[11:19:02] <Deas> doug65536: ?
[11:19:09] <doug65536> Deas: something wrong with loops or do you prefer to make your call stack explode
[11:19:49] <Deas> doug65536: nope, just pure lazyness and tail-calling is neat :)
[11:20:06] <doug65536> Deas: writing functional code in an imperative language is not a good idea
[11:20:25] <Deas> doug65536: so i've been told
[11:21:15] <pixelpimp> haha, i didn't actually read what the code was doing
[11:21:30] <pixelpimp> yeah, that's not the best implementation of recursive functions
[11:21:35] <pixelpimp> although it probably will run just fine
[11:21:58] <Deas> doug65536: and how would you suggest i'd replace the recursive with a loop?
[11:22:28] <Deas> pixelpimp: it does run perfectly fine indeed :)
[11:22:45] <Deas> but if you guys suggest another way, i'm all ears
[11:23:48] <FlashySlash> Hey, can anyone recommend me some script that will add gaussian blur on image/div ?
[11:24:04] <pixelpimp> Deas: better yet, what are you trying to achieve?
[11:24:17] <pixelpimp> this looks like it can be resolved to some very simple math
[11:25:24] <Deas> pixelpimp: getting the ammount i need to devide by, eg 220/1=220, 440/2=220, 660/3=220 etc
[11:26:19] <Deas> where as, i put in 660,2 it would go else 660 2+1, which would then return 3
[11:27:34] <grafi> im confused
[11:29:00] <pixelpimp> as am I
[11:29:25] <doug65536> Deas: while (true) { echo($q ."+". $x . "<br>");  if ($q/$x) == 220) { return $x; } }
[11:29:51] <doug65536> Deas: oops, forgot to increment $x
[11:30:01] <pixelpimp> what are your possible input and outputs?  i.e. getXfromPackage(x, y) returns z; what are x, y and z?
[11:30:09] <Deas> dont need the echo, i forgot to take it out
[11:30:14] <doug65536> Deas: for ( ; ; ++$x) { echo($q ."+". $x . "<br>");  if ($q/$x) == 220) { return $x; } }
[11:30:22] <pixelpimp> i don't think a loop is necessary.  i think he just needs floor() and some simple division
[11:31:08] <doug65536> yes, if the echo isn't needed it's just math
[11:31:13] <Deas> pixelpimp: getXfromPackage(x, y), returns z, where x could be 660 and y just w/e, not sure if it
[11:31:26] <Deas> it's needed for non-recursive
[11:31:46] <Deas> also poor naming of the function :p
[11:33:55] <Deas> doug65536: yeah, it's pretty much just a math function to return what i need to divide x with to get 220 again
[11:34:16] <doug65536> Deas: I think a C++ optimizer has a chance of seeing through that loop and optimizing it down a lot, but I would be shocked if php optimized that at all
[11:35:00] <doug65536> also, it is a stack overflow / crash waiting to happen if the inputs are out of range
[11:35:25] <pixelpimp> is this not as simple as getXfromPackage(x) { return floor(x / 220); } ?
[11:36:56] <Deas> pixelpimp: like i said, i need the y, with input of x and z=220 ( x/y=z  )
[11:37:14] <CorySimmons> Anyone know of a good/recent/option-rich "in viewport" plugin?
[11:37:32] <CorySimmons> Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but I've only found a couple old ones via Google
[11:38:42] <pixelpimp> i am just so confused here, because it seems like you have the answer to the question before you ask it
[11:39:39] <pixelpimp> perhaps describe what you're using the function for?
[11:40:06] <CorySimmons> ?
[11:40:11] <pixelpimp> not you
[11:40:12] <doug65536> y = (1/220) * x ?
[11:40:13] <CorySimmons> heh, ok
[11:40:55] <doug65536> or y = x / 220
[11:41:06] <doug65536> exactly what pixelpimp said
[11:41:19] <doug65536> Deas: ^
[11:41:44] <Deas> doug65536: ohhey, totally forgot about that math-magic with division
[11:43:27] <doug65536> I almost want to put your code in C++ and see if gcc can see right through it and make it a divide :D
[11:43:49] <pixelpimp> i would be very impressed if it could
[11:44:08] <doug65536> I've seen gcc do mindblowing optimizations of that type
[11:44:55] <doug65536> getting it to keep your sse stuff in registers when you want it to is another matter :D
[11:44:55] <pixelpimp> do eet
[11:44:59] <pixelpimp> it's like 4 lines :)
[11:47:00] <kev999> hi
[11:48:00] <kev999> looks busy here ....
[11:48:53] <pixelpimp> you missed a thrilling conversation about the benefits of algebra
[11:48:53] <kev999> I'm trying to use the .animate() function, but want to pass the parameter to be animated as a variable
[11:50:32] <kev999> for example $pos='left'
[11:50:43] <kev999> $(this).animate({$pos:'20px','swing']}, $speed, function() {fn_checkPos();});
[11:50:57] <pixelpimp> i'd suggest building a separate object first and passing that.  var animProperties = {}; animProperties[myVariableName] = '100px'; $('myElement').animate(animProperties, 500);
[11:51:15] <kev999> #pixelpimp busy typing - missing all the dry humour
[11:51:21] <pixelpimp> what?
[11:51:43] <kev999> algebra..
[11:52:34] <kev999> #pixelpimp - didn't know you could do that - let me try
[11:52:56] <pixelpimp> essentially what you just did in your line but with a variable and a different way of setting it
[11:53:38] <pixelpimp> the important thing is the animProperties[myVariableName] as the way of accessing the object
[11:54:07] <pixelpimp> if you put {myVariableName: '100px'} it'll interpret it as a property to define rather than a variable
[11:55:41] <sidwinder> hey guys
[12:02:09] <kev999> #pixelpimp http://pastebin.com/NBszNm96
[12:02:31] <kev999> it didn't work - I'm probably suffering a logic blip
[12:03:23] <DaniG2k> guys im trying to get some jquery that was working for me before with bootstrap

[12:03:33] <DaniG2k> the selector must have broken the functionality
[12:04:02] <Keavon> It works in this example http://jsfiddle.net/thebabydino/KzVfy/
[12:04:32] <DaniG2k> my code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/uAVAv/
[12:04:43] <pixelpimp> kev999: you can't put the 'swing' there
[12:04:45] <DaniG2k> but it doesnt seem to work with bootstrap 3, as I said
[12:05:59] <kev999> OK - let me try again ... thanks
[12:09:41] <kev999> #pixelpimp you are an amazing flippin genius - I would never have got there without that info - many thanks
[12:11:23] <Keavon> This line isn't working for me: $("tr").click(function(){
[12:11:26] <RRR2> pixelpimp is not a channel
[12:11:29] <RRR2> lol
[12:11:33] <d21> how can i click on a menu which contains no id/names only function 'javascript:clickMenu('agenda');'. i was trying to call by doing this clickMenu('agenda'); but then page asks to leave/stay
[12:11:45] <kev999> I'm going to update the paste - I've got the swing bit working - thought you may be interested
[12:15:17] <kev999> #pixelpimp - signing off - thanks for your help - completed code : http://pastebin.com/6F3npbxS
[12:15:40] <Mrgoose2> I thought with jquery mobile 1.4 you could place the panel outside of the page, did that change
[12:20:39] <Deas> pixelpimp: doug65536: is there a way i can force an int onto php? eg; if x/220 and x would be 250 for some reason
[12:20:59] <Deas> and/or check for int only return
[12:22:28] <DaniG2k> guys i had some code that was working fine without jquery but now it seems to not work any longer
[12:22:31] <DaniG2k> http://jsfiddle.net/uAVAv/
[12:22:41] <DaniG2k> its an add/remove thingy with a fadein/fadeout
[12:22:48] <doug65536> Deas: floor
[12:22:57] <DaniG2k> again, it was working fine without bootstrap
[12:23:14] <doug65536> Deas: well, actually, a C-style cast
[12:23:35] <doug65536> Deas: (int)$foo
[12:24:09] <Deas> doug65536: would that return 0 if not an int or try to round it?
[12:24:32] <doug65536> Deas: it will chop. it just ignores everything after the decimal. is that what you want?
[12:25:12] <Mrgoose2> With Jquery Mobile, how can i put my "pages" in multiple html files
[12:25:20] <doug65536> Deas: (int)1.9   <-- is 1
[12:26:22] <T13|naps> Truncates.
[12:26:48] <T13|naps> !api round
[12:26:50] <b-ot> T13|naps: No matches.
[12:26:57] <T13|naps> !api floor
[12:26:58] <b-ot> T13|naps: No matches.
[12:27:03] <T13|naps> Hmm.
[12:35:35] <d21> how can i click without having id/class only title/alt/type?
[12:36:13] <Deas> doug65536: might just use http://php.net/manual/en/internals2.opcodes.instanceof.php to see if it's an int, that way i can return an error if it's not
[12:41:44] <grafi> boop
[12:42:20] <doug65536> Deas: really? why would you do that?
[12:42:50] <doug65536> Deas: your input must be a multiple of 220?
[12:43:06] <grafi> this is bad design
[12:43:08] <grafi> :|
[12:43:11] <Deas> doug65536: pretty much
[12:43:27] <doug65536> Deas: my instincts tell me that you could run into rounding problems where the answer is 2.99999999999999999977382148
[12:44:17] <HenryCH> I have a few links that I generate with data-id=x attributes and I have a js function that gets called on clicking any of those links, how come sometimes I get the wrong number as ID?
[12:45:35] <doug65536> Deas: if you really must do that, use modulus. do if ($whatever % 220 !== 0) { return your error... }
[12:45:49] <grafi> HenryCH make a fiddle for the problem?
[12:45:56] <HenryCH> I mean for example, I check the developer tools and the data-id attribute is 10, then I have a console.log on the js function for the $('.myclass').data('id) and it outputs for example 10, the id of another link, not the clicked one
[12:46:48] <HenryCH> second should be 11, not 10 :P
[12:47:04] <HenryCH> fiddle would be hard..
[12:47:59] <grafi> doesnt sound hard
[12:47:59] <T13|needsCoffee> Why would clicking id 10 produce 11?
[12:48:00] <grafi> ...
[12:48:26] <grafi> just take the html, take the js, boom done
[12:48:52] <grafi> HenryCH is it always one-off?
[12:48:52] <grafi> ^^
[12:48:59] <HenryCH> no it happens every time
[12:49:04] <Deas> doug65536: i'm not sure modulus would help me, i've already considered it
[12:49:21] <doug65536> Deas: just for the "error check"
[12:49:54] <HenryCH> well, just tried it some, it looks like if it always gives the lowest id first
[12:50:02] <HenryCH> regardless of which one I click
[12:50:10] <doug65536> Deas: if you think php does math reliably, think again
[12:50:16] <HenryCH> and then the next highest etc
[12:50:31] <HenryCH> could it have something to do with delegate()?
[12:50:32] <grafi> still without at least some javascript its hard to guess
[12:50:39] <grafi> probably
[12:50:59] <HenryCH> my js is very simple, sec
[12:51:00] <grafi> something like not using $(this) or so
[12:51:20] <doug65536> Deas: php will try to be "helpful" and switch to floating point randomly on you. It is forced to be precise in modulus though
[12:51:42] <grafi> php, always so helpful
[12:51:43] <grafi> :)
[12:52:00] <Deas> doug65536: mhmm, ill take a swing at it and see what happens
[12:52:45] <HenryCH> http://jsfiddle.net/AERfF/
[12:52:49] <HenryCH> this is all I have in my js
[12:53:22] <HenryCH> the .data('username') appears to be correct, just the id gets switched somehow
[12:54:01] <grafi> instead of joinlink use $(this) probably
[12:54:24] <HenryCH> k let me try
[12:54:41] <HenryCH> nope still happening
[12:55:10] <grafi> HenryCH http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/AERfF/1/ like this?
[12:55:41] <HenryCH> actually nevermind, I think that fixed it!
[12:55:47] <grafi> yup
[12:55:48] <grafi> :P
[12:56:32] <HenryCH> oh right, cause it was referencing the class so it gets the first element?
[12:56:45] <grafi> exactly
[13:01:17] <HenryCH> thanks grafi
[13:01:22] <grafi> no problem
[13:03:57] <DaniG2k> can someone plz help me...-_-
[13:03:59] <DaniG2k> I'm stuck
[13:04:48] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ DaniG2k
[13:04:49] <b-ot> DaniG2k: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:05:02] <DaniG2k> Kambfhase: I've posted my question twice already...
[13:05:30] <DaniG2k> I basically have a few lines of jquery
[13:05:41] <DaniG2k> that were working before I started using twitter bootstrap
[13:05:44] <pixelpimp> looks like you last spoke 40 minutes ago
[13:05:47] <DaniG2k> I'll paste the code
[13:06:32] <Kambfhase> That doesnt look like JavaScript to me.
[13:08:06] <DaniG2k> this is one of the forms
[13:08:10] <DaniG2k> http://jsfiddle.net/kPj39/
[13:08:31] <DaniG2k> adding and removing is supposed to add/remove both the text-area and select menu
[13:09:23] <DaniG2k> even if i put a simple
[13:09:28] <DaniG2k> aslert('hi')
[13:09:37] <DaniG2k> it doesnt seem to be hitting the form at all
[13:10:14] <pixelpimp> try angering it
[13:10:27] <Kambfhase> alert is not a debuuger
[13:11:02] <pixelpimp> what is this language?
[13:11:09] <DaniG2k> coffeescript
[13:11:15] <DaniG2k> but I can write in jquery as well, either works
[13:12:33] <Kambfhase> Zis jQuery, its not a language.
[13:16:08] <DaniG2k> ok i think i got it to wokr
[13:16:09] <DaniG2k> work
[13:16:11] <DaniG2k> thank anyways guys
[13:16:14] <DaniG2k> take care
[13:26:14] <grafi> Cake
[13:26:18] <grafi> Ok
[13:29:27] <HenryCH> Why is it that when I'm on localhost testing my site it works without a hitch but on a real server at godaddy I get random errors when I click on links ("No data received" or forms don't submit)
[13:31:37] <pixelpimp> godaddy has real servers?  i thought they spent their money on advertisements
[13:32:07] <grafi> you mean like the superbowl commercial? ^^
[13:32:27] <pixelpimp> some times real world stuff screws up... there's latency, some times your server is busy, some times your users want to screw up your website, etc
[13:33:06] <grafi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNeRAhA55Zw
[13:33:08] <grafi> fuck godaddy
[13:34:08] <siovene> Hi. I'd like to go through elements in a list and do an ajax call for each. But I'd like the ajax call to terminate before I move on to the next list item.
[13:34:08] <pixelpimp> and they support those god-awful anti-internet bills
[13:34:11] <siovene> How can I do that?
[13:35:57] <grafi> exactly pixelpimp
[13:36:06] <grafi> siovene build a queue
[13:36:15] <grafi> for your ajaxrequests
[13:38:09] <HenryCH> well it was the cheapest one month hosting I found
[13:40:21] <pixelpimp> dreamhost is surely better
[13:40:39] <grafi> in your sleep
[13:40:39] <grafi> :P
[13:40:40] <grafi> haha
[13:47:01] <HenryCH> so the No Data Received etc issues are not my pages' fault?
[13:47:18] <pixelpimp> they could be
[13:59:51] <sunbeam> how can i get just the text of a <a> ?
[14:01:31] <pixelpimp> .text()
[14:01:32] <b-ot> pixelpimp: usually nicer
[14:02:25] <pixelpimp> what? o_O
[14:07:05] <T13|needsCoffee> Nuuuu b-ot!
[14:07:12] <T13|needsCoffee> Wb!!
[14:31:55] <HenryCH> I want to add a countdown timer to a field in every of several rows (different starting countdowns) that are created dynamically. How would I go about this? I'd need to have a setinterval function execute in parallel for each right? But I can't give the field ids since they're created dynamically and how would I target each individually if I give them a class?
[15:03:08] <HenryCH> Sorry.. did anyone reply to my question? this drops without me noticing
[15:03:41] <doug65536> HenryCH: use .each
[15:04:08] <doug65536> HenryCH: $('...some selector...').each(function() { var element = $(this); ... do your setTimeout ... })
[15:04:15] <doug65536> ;
[15:04:47] <doug65536> HenryCH: you could do them all at once in a single setTimeout too, right?
[15:05:48] <HenryCH> hm
[15:06:08] <HenryCH> loop through all and check for the data- attribute?
[15:06:32] <dwarder> how do i check if something2 exist in object.something.something2
[15:07:09] <doug65536> dwarder: thing.has(something2)
[15:07:30] <doug65536> dwarder: something2 can be a jquery object, a selector string, or an html element
[15:08:10] <doug65536> dwarder: your question is vague though
[15:08:28] <doug65536> dwarder: what is object.something.something2 supposed to be? a selector
[15:08:35] <doug65536> ?
[15:08:38] <dwarder> doug65536: no
[15:08:54] <dwarder> doug65536: var object={}
[15:09:08] <doug65536> dwarder: oh, a javascript question
[15:09:08] <dwarder> object.something={}
[15:09:39] <dwarder> yes
[15:11:09] <doug65536> dwarder: well, there's a quick way, and a technical way. quick way is to see if it === undefined. technically, it can exist and be undefined, so if you want to be that strict, you can use object.something.hasOwnProperty('something2')
[15:11:55] <doug65536> dwarder: simple, almost always good enough check is object.something.something2 !== undefined
[15:12:05] <doug65536> !== is not a typo
[15:14:11] <dwarder> doug65536: i see, thanks
[15:20:19] <jned> hey doug65536 do you mind showing me how to use another rss feed.  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/cHbvv/3/
[15:21:22] <jned> doug65536, the feed at theweathernetwork is different cause it does work the same: http://rss.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0289
[15:21:45] <jned> sorry ***doesn't work the same
[15:46:26] <dwarder> anyone handlebars savy?
[15:47:00] <dwarder> i have an object which i sent to my template
[15:47:31] <dwarder> i.e. object.text is equal to 'somethig'
[15:47:43] <dwarder> and object.woot is an array
[15:47:55] <dwarder> how do i iterate over woot?
[15:48:09] <dbtedman> {#each woot}
[15:48:12] <dbtedman> {/each}
[15:48:13] <dwarder> i tried {{#with woot}}
[15:48:16] <dbtedman> at end
[15:48:31] <dwarder> dbtedman: and {{this}} in between?
[15:48:46] <dbtedman> iff you had woot.me
[15:48:51] <dbtedman> you use {{me}}
[15:48:54] <dbtedman> inside
[15:49:05] <dwarder> dbtedman: it is an array
[15:49:23] <dwarder> dbtedman: woot is an array
[15:49:54] <dbtedman> sorry, yes
[15:49:57] <dbtedman> you are correct
[15:50:03] <dbtedman> an example here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15464042/looping-through-a-array-in-handlebars-js
[15:51:01] <dwarder> dbtedman: thank you :)
[15:51:16] <dbtedman> your welcome
[15:51:39] <dwarder> you are*
[15:51:45] <dwarder> :P
[15:52:15] <dwarder> i was corrected like this before, i think it is just a cool way to say : you are

[15:52:27] <Atlantic777> jQuery UI big buttons/touch screen friendly theme?

[15:53:03] <dbtedman> Daniel
[15:53:04] <dwarder> jquery mobile?
[15:53:29] <dwarder> Atlantic777: http://jquerymobile.com/
[15:54:09] <Atlantic777> dwarder: it will be big enough even on large screens?
[15:54:14] <Atlantic777> dwarder: let me try it anyway...
[15:54:17] <dwarder> Atlantic777: yes
[15:54:27] <dwarder> Atlantic777: it is configurable
[15:54:30] <Atlantic777> great! :)
[16:16:45] <scar> is there a way to draw a stroke around letters without having the stroke be shifted when the characters get smallr?
[16:25:09] <Velveeta> scar: are you talking about something like this? http://css-tricks.com/adding-stroke-to-web-text/
[16:25:37] <scar> well, i'm creating a meme generator
[16:25:44] <scar> so not sure if css can be used on the text being drawn
[16:26:21] <Velveeta> it should be able to depending on how you implement it
[16:26:22] <scar> for canvases
[16:26:42] <scar> fillText() and strokeText() is what im using
[16:28:06] <Velveeta> yeah doesn't look like you can use css with that then
[16:35:41] <dwarder> in handlebars if i need something every sixth element do i need to write a helper?
[16:36:12] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure, yeah, unless you want to preprocess your records and add some bit field for handlebars to check
[16:36:37] <dwarder> Velveeta: yes, i just though about modifying the data
[16:36:57] <dwarder> Velveeta: thank you, handlebars is popular, right?
[16:37:08] <Velveeta> in our widgets that use handlebars, we allow for a parse method that receives the data prior to running through the template, so we can do just that if we want to
[16:37:18] <Velveeta> i'd say it's pretty popular, yes
[16:37:22] <Velveeta> or at least i would think it is
[17:36:19] <aFeijo> hi folks, the new elements my ajax returns dont get the click events I set with .on('click', '.myClass', function(){}); Isn't .on() the right way?
[17:51:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: hey
[17:51:16] <Velveeta> afeijo: that looks correct, as long as you're attaching that to some parent-level container above where you're injecting the new content
[17:51:21] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: hullo sir
[17:58:42] <aFeijo> Velveeta, I am, I set to a grandparent. I will review it...
[17:58:56] <Velveeta> yeah that sounds like it *should* work then
[17:59:25] <aFeijo> Velveeta, the event is fancybox, not tradional click or mouseover from core. Is that ok?
[17:59:33] <aFeijo> fancybox is a plugin
[17:59:57] <Velveeta> so you're trying to make those things automatically be fancybox's when you add them to the page?
[18:00:09] <aFeijo> and the 3rd param is an array, not function!!
[18:00:14] <aFeijo> Velveeta, yes
[18:00:34] <aFeijo> better to code a .click() that will trigger fancybox?
[18:00:38] <Velveeta> so, fancybox itself is not an event
[18:00:42] <Velveeta> exactly
[18:00:42] <aFeijo> no, that wouldnt work
[18:00:51] <aFeijo> I have to call fancybox in my ajax callback
[18:01:19] <Velveeta> is fancybox an actual jquery plugin or is it a ui widget build on the widget factory?
[18:02:04] <Velveeta> like is it something custom written from top to bottom, or is it more of a prototype that's put together and run through the widget factory?
[18:02:17] <aFeijo> checking
[18:02:30] <Velveeta> i am too
[18:03:31] <Velveeta> ok, it's an actual plugin
[18:03:51] <Velveeta> it *should* be written as a ui widget based on the widget factory, but that's an implementation detail that's up to its developer
[18:04:06] <Velveeta> so you can't make use of the pseudo selector it would have had created for :ui-fancybox or something
[18:04:13] <aFeijo> I see
[18:04:20] <Velveeta> but let me see if there's something else you can easily tie into
[18:05:24] <Velveeta> ok, yeah, you could set up a click event such that when an item is clicked, it checks to see if it $(this).data('fancybox') === undefined, and if so, run fancybox on it
[18:05:46] <Velveeta> and otherwise, fancybox binds up its own click handler that'll fire
[18:05:50] <aFeijo> Velveeta, I have to code in my $.get callback
[18:05:59] <Velveeta> that way you can lazily instantiate those fancyboxes
[18:06:03] <aFeijo> if I set in my click, it will run before the callback
[18:06:16] <Velveeta> before which callback?
[18:06:58] <aFeijo> my click triggers a function that uses $.get, in that get callback I mean
[18:07:16] <aFeijo> the callback deal with the data from my php code
[18:07:21] <aFeijo> that data has my new elements
[18:08:11] <Velveeta> so then what were you trying to delegate earlier?
[18:09:00] <aFeijo> the click event replace existing elements that has fancybox in it, the new elements need to keep the fancybox feature
[18:10:05] <Velveeta> well there is no "keep" the fancybox feature, fancybox is added to each element individually, so they need to have fancybox instantiated on each of the new elements
[18:10:29] <aFeijo> Ok, thanks for the clarification Velveeta :)
[18:10:32] <Velveeta> and that's what i'm telling you that you can do, set up a click handler at the container level, which will check to see if the target is currently a fancybox, and if not, make it one
[18:10:59] <Velveeta> that way you don't have to do anything in your ajax success callbacks to do that maintenance step for you, it'll be automatic
[18:11:12] <aFeijo> Velveeta, but that wouldn't set a false click before the actual click next to each element?
[18:11:13] <sammich> just want say I'm using this lightbox now, http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/
[18:11:16] <sammich> to say*
[18:11:40] <aFeijo> oh wait
[18:11:44] <Velveeta> so when fancybox sets itself up on an element, it creates a new data object to store its state, cached under .data('fancybox'), so you can just check to see if that exists, and if not, fire .fancybox on the element to create it, and it'll bind up its own click event
[18:11:59] <Velveeta> yeah there are lots of different lightbox-style plugins out there
[18:12:15] <Velveeta> i have no personal opinion on any being better than any others, as i haven't really used any of them much
[18:12:19] <aFeijo> trigger fancybox() manually thru the parent click event? interesting
[18:12:27] <Velveeta> yes
[18:12:33] <aFeijo> sound like fun
[18:12:36] <aFeijo> I'll try
[18:12:40] <Velveeta> in the parent's click event, since the target is your element, you can just do something like this:
[18:13:23] <Velveeta> $(parentElement).on('click', '.targetElement', function () { var $this = $(this); if (!$this.data('fancybox')) { $this.fancybox(); } });
[18:13:49] <Velveeta> actually, maybe something more like this:
[18:14:07] <Velveeta> $(parentElement).on('click', '.targetElement', function (e) { var $this = $(this); if (!$this.data('fancybox')) { $this.fancybox(); $this.trigger(e); } });
[18:14:31] <Velveeta> that way after you create the fancybox, you retrigger the click even on it so that it autolaunches the fancybox after fancybox has bound up its event handler
[18:16:49] <aFeijo> Velveeta, shouldnt it be $(grandparentElement).on('click', '.parentElement'...
[18:17:40] <aFeijo> Velveeta, I try your idea but after the ajax, the click dont work anymore
[18:17:47] <Velveeta> nope, when i say parentElement, i mean just whatever upper-level container you're sticking that listener on, whether it's the direct parent, or grandparent, or whatever… you don't pass the parentElement as your target selector, you want to pass something that's gonna be a selector reference for the actual image or whatever
[18:18:18] <aFeijo> my code is online in a server, btw
[18:18:45] <Velveeta> so if you're wanting to target clicks on img tags, and the tags have some ancestor at any level called #container, you would do $('#container').on('click', 'img', function () {});
[18:20:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: im gonna need your help later on solving that algorithm...still cant solve it
[18:21:16] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: i'm not sure if i'll be able to help you any further on that, it seems like there's too much traversal logic to be involved to ensure that there's always gonna be a fully-walkable path from start to finish
[18:21:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: should I then just test whether the list contains all the names and if not recalculate
[18:22:08] <unnu> hey guys, quick Question: is their an event for not hovering over anything?
[18:22:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> unnu: mouseleave?
[18:22:23] <Velveeta> you can try that, but there's no telling how many times it'll have to loop to get a valid list, since you were talking about 140 or so names in it
[18:22:34] <Velveeta> unnu: what rohan said
[18:22:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: true
[18:22:51] <Velveeta> unnu: or do you mean "at any given time, to determine whether a mouse is *not* over an element" ?
[18:23:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> unnu: if im not mistaken .hover is rearely used now its become mouseover/mouseenter and mouseleave
[18:23:34] <Velveeta> well hover was always a made up event for jquery anyway, consisting of mouseenter/mouseleave listeners
[18:23:43] <aFeijo> Velveeta, the code is looping :)
[18:23:48] <unnu> basically i have divs.hover( $this.css(border big and black)) but i want all the divs to have a light border when none of them are being "hovered" over
[18:24:03] <Velveeta> i always use mouseenter/mouseleave to be explicit about it
[18:24:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: should I try the reverse approach than? get the list first and then output the arrays
[18:24:06] <unnu> sorry for the psudeo ahead of time
[18:24:07] <sammich> unnu: you're thinking about it the wrong way around it?
[18:24:12] <unnu> okay
[18:24:21] <aFeijo> hmm I think I know why
[18:24:42] <sammich> why not have the other divs have a default value, then only the hovered item has a class
[18:24:59] <sammich> oh right
[18:25:03] <unnu> because i want the border to disapear completly
[18:25:19] <unnu> when another one is hoverd over
[18:25:30] <unnu> lemme check mouseleave and enter
[18:25:33] <unnu> brb
[18:27:26] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: i thought the end goal was to get the list… if you have the generated list, why would you need the arrays?
[18:28:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: well if I randomly generate the kill list than I can get the arrays but yes the goal is to do it the reverse way
[18:28:15] <Velveeta> unnu: so, you want a default border on all of the items, but when one item is hovered over, you want the borders on all the others to disappear?
[18:28:24] <unnu> yeah
[18:28:28] <unnu> its cool
[18:28:29] <unnu> i got it
[18:28:31] <unnu> thanks for the help
[18:28:35] <Velveeta> no problem
[18:28:36] <unnu> :D
[18:28:36] <aFeijo> Velveeta, when I click one of my img, it runs the click event 802 times then Stack overflow :)
[18:28:59] <Velveeta> afeijo: you said this is online somewhere right? can i see it?
[18:29:03] <aFeijo> sure
[18:29:05] <aFeijo> http://clients.chillybin.com.sg/bomanbridge/catalogue/
[18:30:00] <aFeijo> and the code http://clients.chillybin.com.sg/bomanbridge/wp-content/themes/boman-bridge/js/scripts.js line 77
[18:30:08] <Velveeta> ok cool
[18:32:26] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/wR4Sh/3/
[18:32:41] <unnu> you guys are the best
[18:32:59] <aFeijo> unnu, I second that!!!
[18:33:27] <Velveeta> unnu: the other thing you could do, i'll type up a quicky example for in a minute
[18:33:50] <Velveeta> might be less overhead and more scalable, but gimme a minute to work through afeijo's problem first
[18:33:55] <unnu> Velveeta, I am trying to build a WYSIWYG editor
[18:34:02] <unnu> its gunna be a long coding road ahead of me
[18:34:17] <Velveeta> why build one when there are some good ones already out there?
[18:34:25] <sammich> exercise?
[18:34:29] <unnu> they don't do what i need them to
[18:34:36] <aFeijo> Velveeta, maybe the problem is with $this.data('fancybox')? It seems to be returning always false
[18:34:38] <unnu> trying to build a CMS from scratch
[18:34:52] <aFeijo> unnu, good luck :)
[18:34:53] <sammich> curious, what is it that's missing?
[18:34:54] <Velveeta> sammich: i understand writing to learn, but that's a hell of a project, generally reserved for pretty seasoned devs :)
[18:35:07] <sammich> well, maybe he's a well seasoned dev...?
[18:35:13] <sammich> he/she*
[18:35:26] <Velveeta> afeijo: that is what the problem is, but the fancybox source shows it setting that, although there'sa  fancyboxType data property
[18:35:50] <aFeijo> Velveeta, how can I debug if we have that .data thru the inspector?
[18:36:14] <Velveeta> afeijo: use your command line in the inspector, that's what i'm doing, but i'm checking something first
[18:36:38] <aFeijo> found the fancyboxType !
[18:38:14] <aFeijo> fancybox is working for the login/register link only (in the top right), not to images that are linked to vimeo videos :/ but that is another issue
[18:38:53] <aFeijo> Velveeta, I believe I fixed it by checking for fancyboxType, loop is gone and my event runs after the ajax call :D
[18:39:03] <aFeijo> now I need to figure out why fancybox is not opening there
[18:39:17] <Velveeta> alrighty then, well it sounds like you're on the right track :)
[18:39:29] <aFeijo> Velveeta, thanks to you!!! :D
[18:40:16] <Velveeta> now you know… and knowing is half the battle!
[18:40:39] <unnu> stupid question: how do i put two selectors together? like $("div .class")
[18:40:48] <unnu> so its just divs with .class
[18:41:25] <Velveeta> $('div.class')...
[18:41:54] <sammich> a lot of luck
[18:41:56] <unnu> XD nvm, i had two dots
[18:41:59] <Velveeta> i think you may be biting off more than you can chew with this project :D even *i* wouldn't attempt to write a wysiwyg editor myself, and i've been doing this kind of work for years
[18:41:59] <unnu> lol
[18:42:11] <unnu> okay
[18:42:17] <unnu> :P just wait and see
[18:42:22] <unnu> ill source it when its done
[18:42:33] <Velveeta> i'm still curious what some of the others don't do that you need
[18:42:55] <unnu> CKeditor, . . . way too much
[18:42:55] * sammich puts that on 'eat my hat' list
[18:42:59] <unnu> i dont need all of that stuff
[18:43:17] <unnu> i want to dumb things down
[18:43:17] <unnu> alot
[18:43:19] <unnu> so
[18:43:20] <sammich> what other languages have you done?
[18:43:34] <unnu> C, C++, C#, PHP,
[18:43:36] <unnu> uhmmm
[18:43:39] <unnu> XAML
[18:43:43] <sammich> how extensively?
[18:43:49] <unnu> C++
[18:43:53] <unnu> all day every day
[18:43:57] * aFeijo uses php for 8+years, pascal (delphi) for 18+ years
[18:44:07] * aFeijo loves database
[18:44:08] <unnu> php, pretty much every day
[18:44:16] <unnu> SQL
[18:44:17] <unnu> alot
[18:44:21] <unnu> idk
[18:44:31] <unnu> im not a complete newb to programming
[18:44:32] <unnu> just JS
[18:44:43] * aFeijo love jQuery, hates pure js
[18:44:44] <unnu> im still learning all the sytaxes and such
[18:44:52] <unnu> and jquery is pretty cool
[18:45:03] <aFeijo> no
[18:45:05] <aFeijo> its awesome
[18:45:06] <unnu> lol
[18:45:09] <unnu> ok
[18:45:10] <sammich> it's handy
[18:45:15] <unnu> ^^^
[18:45:31] <sammich> when performance doesn't matter, it's great
[18:45:32] <Velveeta> it's definitely one good tool to have on your side
[18:45:35] <unnu> i could write this in c++ or c# easy
[18:45:43] <unnu> but im trying it in JS and php
[18:45:57] <unnu> Because why not
[18:45:58] <unnu> lol
[18:46:01] <sammich> you can write a UI tool in C++?
[18:46:09] <unnu> MFC?
[18:46:12] <unnu> i mean
[18:46:12] <unnu> yeah
[18:47:03] <unnu> just need a 1 to 1 for the MFC text styles and HTML/css styles
[18:47:37] <sammich> I'd worry about making sure you've got the patterns down before attempting this
[18:47:50] <unnu> and then its basically a simple MSword mockup that parses the text and pushes out html
[18:48:27] <Velveeta> just make sure it doesn't push it out frontpage style :D
[18:48:30] <unnu> i mean, i am doing this to learn JS as much as anything else
[18:48:47] <unnu> balls deep or not at all
[18:48:48] <unnu> :P
[18:48:57] <Velveeta> that's what it sounds like
[18:49:21] <sammich> as long as you know when you're going down the wrong hole (rewrite time)
[18:49:34] <unnu> making a style bar is my next project
[18:49:38] <Velveeta> but she'll usually smack you when that happens
[18:49:42] <unnu> that styles the textarea
[18:49:50] <sammich> you don't want a textarea
[18:49:54] <sammich> that's your first tip
[18:49:55] <unnu> okay
[18:49:59] <unnu> then what?
[18:50:02] <sammich> I won't charge for that
[18:50:06] <sammich> contenteditable
[18:50:08] <Velveeta> right
[18:50:33] <unnu> sweet
[18:50:42] <unnu> i was wondering about that
[18:51:03] <sammich> hell, just go up to the best web WYSIWYG editors and prettyjs all their libraries
[18:51:09] <Velveeta> also, what kind of browser support are you looking to offer as part of it?
[18:51:20] <unnu> Not IE
[18:51:25] <unnu> lol
[18:51:29] <sammich> not even IE10+?
[18:51:32] <Velveeta> in that case you also might want to look into google polymer
[18:52:43] <unnu> IE10+ i suppose
[18:52:53] <unnu> and ive read a bit on polymer Velveeta
[18:53:24] <unnu> its like DIY webapps + CSS UI thrown together
[18:53:51] <Velveeta> yeah, which are themselves embeddable in other components
[18:54:03] <Velveeta> and when encapsulate their own styles and executable scope
[18:54:06] <unnu> yeah, toolkitchen
[18:54:09] <unnu> erh
[18:54:13] <unnu> polymer rather
[18:54:20] <unnu> stupid names
[18:54:21] <unnu> lol
[18:54:25] <Velveeta> right, yeah, the artist formerly known as toolkitchen :D
[18:56:36] <plamb-> hey guys, can you help me with getting this accordion working
[18:56:37] <plamb-> http://jsfiddle.net/cQMBF/2/
[18:57:08] <plamb-> is it because jquery UI isnt included
[18:58:15] <tw2113> is the according stuff provided by jQuery UI?
[18:58:23] <plamb-> i believe .accordion is
[18:58:26] <sammich> that totally looks like UI
[18:58:38] <tw2113> then yes it need to have the lib included
[18:59:06] <plamb-> hmm just included it, still doesn't seem to be working
[18:59:06] <plamb-> http://jsfiddle.net/cQMBF/4/
[18:59:27] <sammich> plamb-: that's not the structure for an accordion
[18:59:51] <sammich> el#accordion > h3+.accordion-divs
[19:00:11] <sammich> el#accordion > h3+div.accordion*
[19:00:14] <plamb-> i was basing the structure on this
[19:00:15] <plamb-> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4149171/jquery-ui-accordion-on-ul
[19:01:35] <Velveeta> you were also missing some closing anchor tags
[19:02:04] <plamb-> err
[19:02:12] <plamb-> oh, on a
[19:02:31] <Velveeta> right, you have things like: <h3><a href="#">Introduction</h3>
[19:02:41] <plamb-> interesting: http://jsfiddle.net/cQMBF/6/
[19:02:53] <plamb-> it only accordion's the first div
[19:03:16] <plamb-> so if i do one div and make all the subheadings a different html tag maybe it will work?
[19:03:43] <Velveeta> it will only accordion the first div you have there, so you need to make that a div wrapper for all of your other divs
[19:03:50] <plamb-> roger that
[19:04:04] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/cQMBF/7/
[19:04:14] <Velveeta> i only did the first section like that, but you get the idea
[19:04:24] <plamb-> yup
[19:04:27] <plamb-> makes sense now
[19:04:29] <plamb-> why it didnt work
[19:25:39] <unnu> GAHHH
[19:25:45] <unnu> nvm
[19:25:47] <unnu> zindex
[19:25:50] <unnu> thanks
[19:25:51] <unnu> :D
[19:47:27] <seanz> Greetings humans. I'm trying to find certain elements within a <div> that have a certain ID.
[19:47:43] <seanz> I'm trying to use [id="value"], but I'm not finding the markup, though I know it's there.
[19:47:47] <seanz> Any suggestions?
[19:47:57] <seanz> I'm sure someone has to have had this problem in the past.
[19:48:03] <pixelpimp> $('#id')
[19:48:17] <seanz> That form will give me the ID from anywhere within the document.
[19:48:28] <seanz> I only want these values if they're within the <div> I mentioned.
[19:48:38] <pixelpimp> it's an ID.
[19:48:39] <pixelpimp> it's unique.
[19:49:02] <seanz> I understand, but I'm got a few classes running that are searching within their own section of the markup.
[19:49:04] <pixelpimp> unless they're not always in that div.  in which case, 'div #id'
[19:49:30] <seanz> I'm trying a $(parent).find('id="value"')
[19:49:34] <seanz> That's not finding anything.
[19:51:16] <pixelpimp> if you have the div as a jquery object, $('#id', jQueryObject)
[19:51:35] <pixelpimp> so parent in your case
[19:51:39] <boytoy> So to make my buttons easier to touch on mobile devices, I need something like https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js or https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini/Tocca.js?
[19:51:48] <pixelpimp> $('#value', parent)
[19:51:48] <seanz> pixelpimp: Sweet! Trying it.
[19:52:51] <boytoy> Trying to wrap my head around it
[19:53:05] <pixelpimp> if you need multitouch support, maybe
[19:53:12] <seanz> Hm. That's not quite working pixelpimp.
[19:53:16] <seanz> It seems like it should, though.
[19:53:39] <pixelpimp> tested it with a pared down version, seemed to work
[19:53:47] <boytoy> pixelpimp: Not that I can think of. All I have are buttons and a couple of range sliders.
[19:53:51] <seanz> pixelpimp: Ok, then I'm doing something wrong.
[19:54:03] <boytoy> pixelpimp: Oh and maybe zooming for iScroll
[19:54:43] <pixelpimp> boytoy: the only thing you might need is to lower the delay on taps to see if they're double taps (although it seems Hammer.js doesn't help with that, since it supports double tap)
[19:55:17] <pixelpimp> mobile webkit usually puts a 300ms delay on taps which can be annoying if you know you won't double tap
[19:55:25] <boytoy> Ah, well that's great =)
[19:55:34] <pixelpimp> i use google fastbuttons
[19:55:37] <boytoy> I always get this uneasy feeling everytime I suspect I might need to add another lib =)
[19:55:47] <pixelpimp> https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons
[19:56:18] <boytoy> Ooh
[19:56:24] <boytoy> pixelpimp: Looks delicious!
[19:56:50] <pixelpimp> there is a jQuery.fastClick.js to make it easier ($('#whatever').fastClick(function() { /* callback */ })
[19:58:38] <boytoy> pixelpimp: http://dave1010.github.io/jquery-fast-click/ right?
[19:58:48] <boytoy> came across http://x1024.github.io/jquery-fastbutton/ as well
[19:59:45] <pixelpimp> the first, yeah
[19:59:53] <pixelpimp> but i imagine either work
[20:00:36] <seanz> pixelpimp: Where did you get the info for including the parent div as the starting point?
[20:00:41] <seanz> I don't see that in the jQuery docs.
[20:00:42] <boytoy> pixelpimp: thank you *so* much
[20:01:09] <boytoy> pixelpimp: any other mobile web ui improvements while we're at it? =)
[20:01:21] <boytoy> that one should know of?
[20:03:10] <pixelpimp> seanz: i do not know where you would find that in the docds
[20:03:42] <seanz> There's a page for selecting elements by ID. I would expect it to show up there. I'm just wondering what made you think to try it.
[20:03:47] <seanz> pixelpimp: ^ ^ ^
[20:04:25] <pixelpimp> boytoy: draw images/canvas at size * screen DPI, then scale down to take into account retina/high dpi devices
[20:04:43] <pixelpimp> seanz: no idea; something I've seen before I suppose
[20:05:00] <seanz> pixelpimp: Thanks for the suggestion. I definitely wish it worked.
[20:05:45] <boytoy> awesome
[20:06:45] <boytoy> retina really makes that much of a diff?
[20:07:32] <boytoy> i gotta stay more updated on the latest tech
[20:07:40] <pixelpimp> seanz: http://jsfiddle.net/XwTDW/
[20:08:14] <pixelpimp> boytoy: yeah, my graphs look pretty shitty when scaled up by the browser after they were rendered at half size
[20:08:42] <aFeijo> my S4 screen is better then that apple retina BS :D
[20:08:59] <pixelpimp> well your DPI is probably pretty close
[20:09:12] <pixelpimp> and so your device will render canvas as shit, too ;)
[20:09:52] <aFeijo> "But on the flip side, the iPhones screen is extremely small compared to the GS4. And though its hard to complain about its Retina Display, it isnt nearly as sharp as the GS4s 1080p screen."
[20:10:35] <pixelpimp> i want a GS4 :(
[20:10:42] <aFeijo> apple was too arrogant saying that retina was the best possible for the human eye... yeah right
[20:10:49] <aFeijo> pixelpimp, You'd love it too :P
[20:10:51] <pixelpimp> too expensive for me at the moment.  just got a HTC One S, though
[20:11:26] <aFeijo> pixelpimp, believe me, here in Brazil the prices is 2 times or more of any device. Worst country in the world
[20:11:30] <aFeijo> chocking
[20:11:30] <pixelpimp> put a drop of water or get a lot of grease on your screen... you can see those pixels nice and clear
[20:11:31] <boytoy> pixelpimp: cool, gotcha
[20:11:55] <boytoy> was busy implementing my latest jewel
[20:11:56] <aFeijo> grease, sure!!! HAHA
[20:12:02] <boytoy> <body class="<%= 'use-fastclick' if mobile? %>">
[20:12:07] <boytoy> boom
[20:12:13] <tw2113> remember, white out is your error correction friend
[20:12:16] <boytoy> *applause*
[20:12:24] <pixelpimp> from rubbin' yo face on it
[20:13:30] <jedimind> i rub my face on a lot of things
[20:14:06] <boytoy> lmao
[20:16:10] <monokrome> Does anyone here know the proper way to bind to a callback with semantic-ui?
[20:16:17] <jedimind> i finally found cmd+ ~ exists, my life is changed
[20:20:15] <seanz> pixelpimp: Thanks for the jsfiddle. I'm still having some trouble with it, but I'll revisit later.
[20:23:12] <aFeijo> Velveeta, hey buddy, I fixed my fancybox issue ;) task complete!!
[20:23:40] <Velveeta> nice :D shit, i forgot i was halfway into playing with that, and then got called away to do housework by the wife :D
[20:23:45] <Velveeta> so, good to hear that you managed to nail it :)
[20:29:14] <aFeijo> Velveeta, tell me about wife and housework... got dishes to deal here lol
[20:29:47] <Velveeta> heheheh
[20:31:49] <boytoy> pixelpimp: also found https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick
[20:31:58] <x-finite> i have a birth yyyy, mm and dd in separate variables, what would be the best practices to allow it to substract from current date
[20:32:03] <boytoy> made by, and get this, the financial times
[20:32:27] <Velveeta> x-finite made a date object out of it, a date object for current date, and just subtract the 2
[20:32:43] <pixelpimp> hey, you never know who is gonna make a cool library
[20:32:45] <Velveeta> make*
[20:32:53] <pixelpimp> i was reading something cool made by the okcupid people
[20:33:07] <x-finite> Velveeta, i meant what would be the most effective way to make a date object out of it i.e. appending values?
[20:33:17] <Velveeta> oh gotcha
[20:33:43] <Velveeta> just pass them through the date constructor as parameters, new Date(year, month, day);
[20:33:53] <x-finite> great
[20:34:31] <boytoy> pixelpimp: true true
[20:34:42] <boytoy> pixelpimp: really what was that?
[20:36:01] <boytoy> pixelpimp: i just made my own style buttons based on http://hellohappy.org/css3-buttons/ which is also from okcupid
[20:37:05] <pixelpimp> nifty.  i once had a very popular css3 button tutorial
[20:39:38] <boytoy> r.i.p. very popular css3 button tutorial
[20:40:07] <Velveeta> heheheh
[20:40:28] <tw2113> cheeseboy
[20:40:35] <obelich> hiyas
[20:40:52] <obelich> god nite jejee i have a problem im try to use  $("#galeria").hide();
[20:40:58] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[20:41:23] <obelich> it work perfect in desktop but in Android or Iphone it dont hide the div :(
[20:41:55] <obelich> anyone know how to make it work on mobile ?
[20:42:07] <Velveeta> um, that should work just fine
[20:42:12] <Velveeta> what's not working about it?
[20:42:56] <obelich> Velveeta: it work perfec in the desktop but in phone it dont work dont hide the div galeria :(
[20:43:01] <oste> I am using code like this $element.find('.btn').prop('href', '/my-path/3');
[20:43:07] <oste> but I am getting the following error
[20:43:26] <oste> jquery Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression '/my-path/3'
[20:43:28] <x-finite> js> var birth=new Date(1985,05,02); var today=new Date(); var result=today-birth; print result;
[20:43:29] <Velveeta> obelich: there's nothing custom that i know of that needs to be done to make that work in a mobile environment… hide should work exactly the same in any environment
[20:43:33] <b-ot> x-finite: No output.
[20:43:47] <Velveeta> oste: you need to use .attr for that, not .prop
[20:44:18] <boytoy> pixelpimp: looks like these FT cats have built something better than iscroll as well -- http://labs.ft.com/articles/ft-scroller/
[20:44:21] <x-finite> js> var birth=new Date(1985,05,02); var today=new Date(); var result=today-birth; print (result);
[20:44:23] <oste> Velveeta I get the same error using either
[20:44:27] <b-ot> x-finite: 894265787085
[20:45:01] <oste> $element.find('.btn').attr('href', '/my-path/3');
[20:45:04] <oste> produces the same result
[20:45:14] <tw2113> sup danheberden
[20:45:25] <Velveeta> is there a working example somewhere that i can see?
[20:45:29] <obelich> Velveeta: ok i go to check i think some div are no close :) thanks
[20:45:38] <Velveeta> obelich: good luck
[20:45:56] <Velveeta> obelich: that could definitely be an issue, some browsers are more forgiving than others about strictness to layout standards
[20:46:20] <x-finite> Velveeta http://pastebin.com/KButmcip
[20:46:33] <obelich> Velveeta: i try this in chrome mobile :P and iphone i think it use a default one
[20:47:28] <pixelpimp> boytoy: i will need to check that out for sure.  i use iscroll and have some issues with it (and even forked it for my current project)
[20:47:44] <pixelpimp> and thought about writing one from scratch.
[20:47:51] <pixelpimp> which is likely what i'll end up doing
[20:48:21] <Velveeta> x-finite: am i looking for something specific in this pastebin?
[20:49:22] <boytoy> pixelpimp: Cool. I was just like, should I drop iScroll? After hearing you though, yes definitely =)
[20:49:59] <x-finite> i tried the date obj method you suggested but the result wasnt right, these are the actual codes i am using to calculate the age
[20:50:15] <Velveeta> ok, can you make me a working demo out of jsfiddle or something?
[20:50:27] <boytoy> puts me in line with pixelpimp, The Financial Times and the BBC, can't go wrong with that
[20:50:56] <boytoy> pixelpimp: i sent a mail to the authors asking for a closer comparison though, ill let you know how it goes
[20:50:57] <x-finite> js> var birth=new Date(1985,05,02); var today=new Date(); age = Math.floor((todayDate-birthDate) / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)); print (age);
[20:51:02] <b-ot> x-finite: No output.
[20:51:20] <Velveeta> x-finite: jsfiddle, not a paste of code
[20:51:22] <x-finite> js> var birth=new Date(1985,05,02); var today=new Date(); age = Math.floor((today-birth) / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)); print (age);
[20:51:27] <b-ot> x-finite: 28
[20:51:47] <x-finite> my mistake, seems to be working fine :) .. must be issue somewhere else in the code
[20:51:55] <Velveeta> well alrighty then :)
[20:54:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:54:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> problem solved
[20:55:26] <oste> pretty sure it's a bug...
[20:55:38] <oste> removed data-toggle="modal"
[20:55:39] <x-finite> and fixed
[20:55:44] <oste> and it started working
[21:15:15] <unnotused> im working on this WYSIWYG editor
[21:15:25] <unnotused> and im looking for a way to change the format of the html
[21:15:30] <unnotused> Is the correct way to do this
[21:15:58] <unnotused> execCommand(bold,true)
[21:16:34] <unnotused> just researching around, thought i would make sure i was in the right direction
[21:26:43] <Agamemnus> what is the point of having an event object that isn't the real event?
[21:26:52] <Agamemnus> why do I have to do evt = evt.originalEvent?
[21:27:22] <Agamemnus> WHY
[21:27:30] <BWat> jQuery wraps the event to provide additional functionality
[21:27:35] <BWat> like it does for all things :P
[21:27:52] <Agamemnus> it's stupid
[21:42:43] <Agamemnus> is there a way I can disable this evt monster in jquery so that it is always the original event?
[21:42:55] <Agamemnus> i guess i could make a wrapper on .bind to do that..
[21:42:58] <Agamemnus> but not sure
[21:47:06] <x-finite> cookies not working for me http://jsfiddle.net/3Rydb/1/
[21:48:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> x-finite: error line 42
[21:48:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> x-finite: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[21:50:23] <x-finite> there is no line 42?
[21:51:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> x-finite: which now im wondering whether chrome is acting up
[21:53:21] <Agamemnus> i know this code won't work, but how could i get something like it to work? hopefully it makes sense....:
[21:53:23] <Agamemnus> http://jsfiddle.net/h7tgb/
[21:53:44] <Agamemnus> that should be "args[1](evt)"
[21:54:36] <Agamemnus> i might be missing some things
[21:54:51] <Agamemnus> should be arguments not args
[21:55:04] <Agamemnus> ooh
[21:56:26] <dcherman> Agamemnus: why do you not want to use jQuery's event?  what's better about the original event in this particular case?
[21:58:39] <Agamemnus> that I don't have to do evt = evt.originalEvent
[21:59:00] <Agamemnus> and i am not locked into jquery
[22:03:00] <Agamemnus> ok, I got this:
[22:03:02] <Agamemnus> http://jsfiddle.net/h7tgb/1/
[22:03:13] <Agamemnus> oops..
[22:03:24] <Agamemnus> http://jsfiddle.net/h7tgb/2/
[22:03:31] <Agamemnus> any suggestions on improving this?
[22:07:00] <dcherman> Agamemnus: yes.  I wouldn't bother worrying about jQuery lockin tbh, but if you are, overriding .bind, .delegate, and .on are just going to be painful for you.  better to just wrap your handers with a generic fn like this - https://gist.github.com/dcherman/6749507
[22:09:22] <Agamemnus> that'll be ugly.
[22:09:31] <Agamemnus> instead of that, I created an "sbind" extension
[22:10:31] <Agamemnus> doesn't support multiple event handlers
[22:10:51] <Agamemnus> but i just use regular ol' "bind" functionality when I'm using jquery anyway
[22:11:01] <Agamemnus> i could use my own function but don't want to scare the client
[22:11:18] <Agamemnus> i just wish jquery didn't have its own event to begin with.
[22:12:23] <Agamemnus> anyway, well i suppose your code is good, just don't want to wrap on every bind
[22:13:10] <dcherman> so don't use jquery, just use addEventListener/attachEvent directly and manage events on your own if you want.
[22:17:48] <Agamemnus> you're right.
[22:22:44] <Agamemnus> thanks.
[22:43:15] <i8igmac> does any one know a slick a simple way to embed a video with jquery
[22:44:36] <tw2113> assuming you'll be hosting the file on your own server, you could just use the html5 video element
[22:50:21] <i8igmac> i dont want the video to load until the client clicks play
[22:53:36] <unnotused> http://jsfiddle.net/7dE4u/ how do i grab this info outa here
[22:53:52] <unnotused> i wanna grab the text of the closes .text span
[22:53:56] <unnotused> and alert it
[22:54:42] <tw2113> i8igmac, you can set autoplay to be false with <video>
[22:57:10] <unnotused> http://jsfiddle.net/7dE4u/2/
[22:57:20] <unnotused> okay, so i dont know javascript clearly
[22:57:21] <unnotused> lol
[22:57:23] <unnotused> but srsly
[22:57:34] <unnotused> i am getting nothing for var text
[23:01:29] <doug65536> unnotused: you want .siblings('.text') or .prev('.text')
[23:01:46] <doug65536> unnotused: .closest looks at itself, and through the parents
[23:01:58] <unnotused> so .siblings
[23:02:46] <tw2113> i only got siblings to work
[23:02:51] <tw2113> prev failed me
[23:05:50] <doug65536> ah, prev won't because of the <br>
[23:06:12] <unnotused> hrmm
[23:06:18] <doug65536> .prevAll is what I was thinking
[23:06:33] <unnotused> im trying to replace it with a text box
[23:06:38] <unnotused> http://jsfiddle.net/7dE4u/4/
[23:07:00] <unnotused> nvm
[23:07:02] <unnotused> value =
[23:07:50] <doug65536> unnotused: that is not a reliable way to do it
[23:08:01] <unnotused> is there an alt
[23:08:29] <doug65536> unnotused: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7dE4u/5/
[23:09:01] <doug65536> unnotused: the way you were going to do it, special characters like " or & or < might have caused problems
[23:09:12] <unnotused> gotcha
[23:13:18] <doug65536> unnotused: you might want to select its content and focus it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7dE4u/7/
[23:14:35] <unnotused> yeah, i gotta drop the Text: off the front, do it to title, and change edit page to submit changes
[23:14:41] <unnotused> GAHHHH
[23:14:44] <unnotused> so much jquery
[23:14:47] <unnotused> i don't understand
[23:14:48] <unnotused> lol
[23:14:50] <unnotused> LERNING
[23:15:23] <doug65536> unnotused: browse this, I like it: http://jqapi.com/
[23:17:58] <unnotused> I am thinking now function to turn into edit, function to change back to orginal, function to save edit
[23:18:02] <unnotused> :/
[23:20:08] <doug65536> unnotused: why even have an edit page "button". make it click-to-edit
[23:21:16] <unnotused> old people
[23:21:16] <unnotused> lol
[23:21:22] <unnotused> its sad but its true
[23:26:58] <doug65536> unnotused: then at least wrap the "buttons" with <a href="#"></a> or make them really <button></button>
[23:28:15] <doug65536> unnotused: people with disabilities would have a hard time clicking raw spans like that
[23:44:37] <doug65536> unnotused: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7dE4u/11/
[23:45:27] <doug65536> unnotused: it doesn't handle keeping track of which page because you have no reliable means of detecting which page it is
[23:47:25] <doug65536> unnotused: added ability to identify pages in data http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7dE4u/14/
