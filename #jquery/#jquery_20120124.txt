[00:02:44] <hh__> is there a way to not copy, but move a dom element so its parent element is something else?
[00:03:23] <hh__> well actually nevermind
[00:05:26] <Eviltwin> Short answer: yes
[00:22:23] <hdtdi> guys i am using zend framework and i try to create chained select form. now i take the value from the first select, i pass it with post, i get the results from my database and now how to view them ? this is my jquery code http://pastebin.com/AebpAZcX if thats not all you need please tell me what else i can provide :)
[00:28:09] <red_square> hdtdi have you checked the request/response
[00:29:57] <Hooloovoork> ugh...
[00:30:14] <Hooloovoork> someone please D:
[00:35:03] <Cork> Hooloovoork: what?
[00:36:37] <Hooloovoork> Cork: mechler =P
[00:36:41] <Hooloovoork> the spam bot
[00:36:53] <Cork> doesn't have to be
[00:37:03] <Cork> might just be a used with a crappy connection
[00:37:20] <mindis|wurk> hmmh
[00:39:08] <dgx> Can you tell me the name of the second theme here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ ?
[00:41:33] <Mindblighter> strange. chanserv won't op me
[01:01:19] <Wiz_KeeD> can you guys recommend a simple jquery pop-up where i can load a php script
[01:01:21] <Wiz_KeeD> ?
[01:02:34] <xec> Wiz_KeeD: you want a modal with content loaded through ajax?
[01:02:49] <Wiz_KeeD> not neccesairly through ajax
[01:03:20] <Wiz_KeeD> it think it could be preloaded or something, but i want it to have a custom design, pop-up when clicking on a link and be able to send data
[01:03:22] <xec> well, then i'm afraid the question doesn't make much sense, you can't execute php on client side, which is where you're doing jquery
[01:03:24] <Wiz_KeeD> it's a forgot password? script
[01:03:34] <Zogot> Just put the content in a hidden box
[01:03:38] <sahana> Hi all, I want to trigger a click event.
[01:03:38] <Zogot> and a button to show hidden box
[01:04:00] <xec> sahana: what's stopping you? :)
[01:04:04] <sahana>  I tried 		$('#thumbid').trigger('click');
[01:04:06] <sahana> 		 $('#thumbid').click();
[01:04:14] <sahana> It doesn't work!!
[01:04:25] <xec> sahana: how is the click event handler created
[01:04:26] <sahana> what's the problem?
[01:05:20] <xec> sahana: both of those should work, assuming the event handler is bound on that ID, and  also not set via "onclick"
[01:06:10] <sahana> I have 				$(document).ready(function() {
[01:06:12] <sahana> 				$("a#thumbid").fancybox();
[01:06:13] <sahana> 			});
[01:06:58] <sahana> html code: <div id="gallerydiv"><a title="hello" href="../collections/018_002_007.jpg" id="thumbid"></a></div>
[01:07:39] <sahana> what's problem?
[01:08:50] <Wiz_KeeD> so xec, should i go with what Zogot suggested?
[01:09:39] <ChrisK3> has anyone spotted a plugin/easy to use function that resizes images to fit within their parent element on one side, and centers it in the other dimension?, I need this for a site where people can upload any size and aspect image they want, but we want to display them the same size and aspect in places
[01:09:51] <xec> Wiz_KeeD: hard to tell what exactly you need, but hiding and showing elements is very easy, so if you can preload the content you're golden. the rest is just css
[01:10:12] <Wiz_KeeD> ok let me give it a shot
[01:10:39] <ChrisK3> basically the css3 property: background-image: cover, but in JS/jQ and working in IE7 & 8
[01:10:50] <ChrisK3> *background-size
[01:12:36] <sahana> xec: any idea?
[01:13:16] <xec> sahana: i don't see a click event handler?
[01:13:28] <xec> sahana: could you make a demo? see ?demo
[01:13:29] <bot-t1> sahana, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:14:00] <muzone> eddi/join #github
[01:14:02] <sahana> will upload and let u know
[01:15:12] <ChrisK3> this seems like something a lot of people/sites would need, but I haven't found many examples, and the ones I have found are fairly unwieldy
[01:15:25] <Wiz_KeeD> so i have to do it with ajax
[01:19:31] <Wiz_KeeD> am i better off using lightbox or something like that xec ?
[01:23:08] <jobbmon> how can i get the html of a svg node with jquery?
[01:23:46] <jobbmon> $('svg').each(function(){console.log($(this).html());}); doesnt work for me
[01:26:04] <dgx> Hey guys, I'm looking for the name of the second theme on the tab document page. jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ How do I change from 'blue' them to 'gray'?
[01:27:30] <xec> Wiz_KeeD: sry was afk. personally i always code simple things like modals myself, gives complete control and is quicker than reading some plugin documentation ;)
[01:27:59] <Wiz_KeeD> true that, i'm on my way coding it as we speak
[01:28:11] <Wiz_KeeD> how old are you xec?
[01:29:07] <xec> Wiz_KeeD: 29, why?
[01:29:36] <Wiz_KeeD> was just curious, you seem very helpfull and friendly :D
[01:29:54] <Wiz_KeeD> not many like you around here
[01:31:34] <xec> thank you :)
[01:31:51] <muzone> At https://gist.github.com/1657796 (http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/Z4362/) - how to get JS to replace the "State/province" text_field with collection_select unobtrusively if it has_states (or similar)?
[01:43:27] <jobbmon> so no ideas on my svg issue?
[01:44:23] <xec> muzone: from a js standpoint, that code is absolutely horrendous, it does just about everything wrong =/
[01:44:41] <muzone> xec: heheh
[01:44:56] <muzone> yeah ive been getting a lot of shit over it..
[01:44:58] <xec> muzone: i don't know ror, any chance you can make it output the data differently
[01:45:26] <muzone> I'm trying..
[01:47:12] <xec> muzone: just to be clear,i'm talking about the jsfiddle, not the gist
[01:48:17] <muzone> yup
[01:48:44] <DEac-> hi
[01:52:58] <xec> muzone: that said, i don't understand the question either, none of the phrases appear in the jsfiddle, you want to remove the <input type="text"> ? or fill it with whatever is selected in the dropdown?
[01:53:04] <DEac-> if i want to fetch data via ajax, i must provide a function, which will called, if it's loaded. so it isn't possible that, ajax returns the fetched data? people = $.ajax('/people')
[01:53:40] <xec> ?ajax101 @ DEac-
[01:53:41] <bot-t1> DEac-, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[01:53:44] <muzone> xec: yes sir pretty much..
[01:54:11] <muzone> well i want to remove the input and replace it with a select box
[01:54:36] <muzone> but the fact that so many different technologies are involved..
[01:54:37] <muzone> damn
[01:54:41] <muzone> im sorry to make y'all suffer
[01:55:04] <xec> DEac-: quick answer is: no
[01:55:14] <DEac-> xec: bot-t1 i know the code. my question is, if it's possible? it can be an other method of course. $.ajax was only an example
[01:55:55] <xec> DEac-: because ajax is asynchronous it will return before you can set a value, so to speak
[01:56:42] <DEac-> and there is no synchronous technique?
[01:58:11] <xec> DEac-: well, you can set an option to make it synchronous, but that makes it blocking, and your entire app will hang until the request is complete...
[01:58:51] <xec> muzone: i can't get jsfiddle to save for some reason, gonna spam your private chat with a couple lines if you don't mind
[02:00:51] <muzone> hehe
[02:00:55] <muzone> thanks man :-)
[02:01:49] <DEac-> that's the first time, that i which a sync-ajax-request.
[02:02:46] <mathi> hi
[02:02:53] <mathi> I have this error: $ is not defined
[02:03:06] <mathi> though I included the code in a script tage before </body>
[02:06:26] <kampsun> mathi: Are you sure that your jquery.js is being included before you try to use $
[02:11:56] <mindis|wurk> hmm. i wonder what's wrong when an editable iframe gets its content reseted when using draggable
[02:12:42] <ChrisK3> anyone knows how you invert a value? say my function returns 50, but I want it to be -50 ?
[02:12:57] <ChrisK3> can't word it well enough to make google understand me
[02:15:18] <kampsun> ChrisK3: multiply with -1
[02:17:11] <quicksilver> or just use -
[02:17:34] <quicksilver> > a
[02:17:34] <quicksilver> 3
[02:17:34] <quicksilver> > -a
[02:17:35] <quicksilver> -3
[02:17:35] <hsbot>   Not in scope: `a'
[02:17:35] <hsbot>   can't find file: L.hs
[02:17:54] <quicksilver> hsbot: wtf? we don't need a haskell bot here do we?
[02:18:46] <kampsun> yeah that works too, don't know why I though about making it 'complicated' by using multiplication
[02:19:13] <kampsun> too they d the same thing 'behind the scenes'?
[02:19:19] <kampsun> s/d/do
[02:19:37] <wltoriginal> Hi guys.  I don't understand how an anonymous function in a callback in JQuery (or javascript) gets scope. In e.g. function foo(){ $('a').each(function(){//do something; }) } why does the anonymous function have scope of function foo and not of the jQuery object that called each ?  Does anyone know how the callback anonymous function get its scope?
[02:22:09] <Carlitta87_> hey, i have an old version of jcarousel....but i need to up date it due to the error i have on this page... http://www.dulcetheory.com/dulce//sites/default/files/PowerfulData/default.htm
[02:22:21] <sj26> wltoriginal: there's a different between scope and binding.
[02:23:32] <sj26> scope defines the names available. a function closes the names available to it where defined and keeps them. This can be overriden with the loathed `with` statement.
[02:23:39] <sj26> Binding dictates the `this` object, basicall.y
[02:24:48] <scratcha> hey all, can anyone suggest how i might optimise the following code for better performance ? http://pastie.org/3242586
[02:28:31] <Carlitta87_> might have to post again
[02:28:34] <Carlitta87_>  hey, i have an old version of jcarousel....but i need to up date it due to the error i have on this page... http://www.dulcetheory.com/dulce//sites/default/files/PowerfulData/default.htm
[02:29:51] <kul> I'm having some diffculty with looping a function.. I have 5 slides in my slider and once last slide is displayed I would like to start my function again from 1st slide --> here is my code http://pastebin.com/WCNam3EN
[02:30:01] <ChrisK3> kampsun: thanks, was going to say that it doesn't work, then I remembered that different math operators have different priority =P some ()s fixed that
[02:30:01] <kul> Can any1 suggest me how to go ahead /
[02:31:34] <Funi> anyone have an experience with jqplot?
[02:31:37] <ChrisK3> has anyone spotted a plugin/easy to use function that resizes images to fit within their parent element on one side, and centers it in the other dimension?, I need this for a site where people can upload any size and aspect image they want, but we want to display them the same size and aspect in places (sorry about repeating, but I've gotten 0 answers in 1.5h)
[02:31:44] <wltoriginal> sj26, my problem is that anonymous functions in a callback don't explicitly say where they are defined (and hence where they get closure from).   I've seen in explanations that the enclosing function determines the closure, e.g. function foo(){ $('a').each(function(){//my function})) }  but the anonymous function look as if it is defined inside the jquery object doesn't it?
[02:31:45] <scratcha> kul: i do not see a loop in your code
[02:31:53] <mullie> when I do option.selected = true; my onchange() on the select isn't executed. Any idea why? How can I fix it?
[02:31:59] <kul> there is if condiotion scratcha
[02:32:04] <kul> *condition
[02:32:15] <scratcha> kul: if != loop
[02:32:19] <mathi> kampsun, I have $document.ready(...) before I include the js file
[02:32:27] <mathi> (jquery)
[02:32:33] <sj26> wltoriginal: no, it's defined inside the foo funciton.
[02:32:39] <scratcha> also your function does not appear to be recusrive
[02:33:05] <sj26> wltoriginal: so it inherits the scope of `foo`
[02:33:21] <kul> scratcha what changes would you recommend me ? :-S
[02:34:15] <scratcha> setup a jsfiddle so we can see whats going on
[02:34:38] <kul> okay gimme a min
[02:35:31] <wltoriginal> sj26, are you saying that it is created as if i had declared it: function foo(){ var myfunction = function(){//my function//} ; $('a').each(myfunction); } ?
[02:35:44] <sj26> that's exactly how arguments work, yes
[02:36:00] <sj26> the argument is evaluated before passing it to the next function.
[02:38:35] <kul> scratcha img are not loaded http://jsfiddle.net/WQmDj/ <-- But I think U'll see wat I'm trying to achieve here
[02:38:44] <kampsun> mathi: You can't use $() before including jQuery. you have to call $(document).ready() after you have loaded jquery
[02:38:45] <wltoriginal> sj26, thanks for clearing that up. Do you know by any chance what the technical term is for this type of argument evaluation so that  i can find more info about it?  I'm kinda struggling to narrow the search down to the correct documentation.
[02:39:20] <sj26> wltoriginal: this is how most languages work, not sure if it has a particular name
[02:39:27] <mathi> kampsun, I would like to include the code before the </body> tag, but $(document).ready must be in <head> I think....
[02:39:29] <sj26> it's algebraic
[02:39:43] <sj26> maybe look at lambda calculus?
[02:40:08] <sj26> one(two(3)) will always evaluate two(3) first, then one(...) with the result
[02:40:43] <wltoriginal> sj26: thanks again for the help!
[02:41:00] <sj26> no worries! maybe read up some general compsci, i can't remember the term for it.
[02:41:38] <sj26> wltoriginal: AH, it's composition: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)#Composing_function_calls
[02:42:08] <sj26> specifically, postfix composition
[02:43:06] <kampsun> mathi: if you need $(document) in the <head> then you need jquery before that. Simple as that.
[02:44:33] <kul> scratcha i updated it with images
[02:47:12] <scratcha> whats the link again mate
[02:48:24] <kul> http://jsfiddle.net/WQmDj/ <-- scratcha
[02:48:44] <scratcha> don't think the images have updated mate
[02:49:08] <scratcha> when it gets to the end, you want it to jump to slide 1, is that correct ?
[02:50:12] <kul> yes
[02:50:35] <kul> in my code it is jumping to 1st after second last slide
[02:51:12] <kul> so I think it is calling the command when last slide is about to load. I want to call the command when last slide is done loadinf
[02:51:16] <kul> *loading
[02:51:53] <wltoriginal> sj26: thanks again :)
[02:52:03] <sj26> np
[02:54:04] <scratcha> kul why not look at a <li> structure and step through it with .each
[02:54:07] <scratcha> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[02:55:30] <kul> So you suggest that I convert my current structure into list structure ?
[03:15:34] <kul> can any1 explain me what this line of code does  ? --> var $next =  $active.next().length ? $active.next() : $('#slideshow IMG:first');
[03:17:47] <bigkevmcd> kul: it's looping round, if there's a .next() element, then it goes onto it, otherwise it returns to the first element
[03:18:12] <kul> awesome! :) thanks a lot bigkevmcd
[03:26:25] <shwaiil> hi
[03:27:11] <mindis|wurk> well that's nice. if you ask firefox for the body content of an iframe while it's part of a draggable object, it returns nothing
[03:27:18] <shwaiil> Q: for keystroke I'm finding that using cursor keys <- -> only works on firefox. Can someone confirm it ? I cant even see any event while using cursor keys on http://api.jquery.com/keypress/ example.
[03:27:20] <shwaiil> Thanks for looking
[03:28:27] <quicksilver> shwaiil: possible, yes. Don't use keypress.
[03:28:30] <quicksilver> use keyup and keydown.
[03:28:47] <shwaiil> quicksilver: thanks for looking. I'll take a look on that. Any reason for that ?
[03:28:49] <quicksilver> at least, only use keypress for standard printable characters.
[03:28:55] <shwaiil> quicksilver: ok
[03:29:02] <quicksilver> well the docs for keypress on the very page you pasted have some reasons.
[03:29:08] <quicksilver> "as the keypress event isn't covered by any official specification, the actual behavior encountered when using it may differ across browsers, browser versions, and platforms"
[03:29:40] <shwaiil> quicksilver: thanks for your tip, this is working on the example page :)
[03:46:22] <mindis|wurk> what's the difference between something.load(function() {}); and something.load({success: function(){}}); ?
[03:46:42] <ksinkar> hello guys, I have bound  a toggle method on a checkbox
[03:46:50] <ksinkar> but the method works fine
[03:47:04] <ksinkar> only the checkbox doesn't get ticked
[03:52:08] <kul> Want to call a function if the next element dosent exists how to go ahead /
[03:52:15] <kul> any1  ?
[03:52:51] <scratcha> jul .exists() maybe ?
[03:52:54] <scratcha> *kul
[03:53:33] <bartmax> kul $(this).next().length != 0 && someCrazyFunction()
[03:53:36] <scratcha> kul: or use .next().length
[03:53:46] <scratcha> ^
[03:54:21] <kul> kool Thanks guys ! Will check it out
[03:56:46] <shwaiil> Q: I'm doing $(window).keyup(function(e){ .. } that works fine, but not in IE6. But for at least a diferent .bind I've done it works $(window).bind('keyup', 'esc', function() { .. }. Uses a slightly diferent syntax. The reason, I'm sticking with the first one, for the one that's not working on ie6, it's because I need to check if key is 37 or 39 (cursor keys). Any tip is appreciated! Thanks
[03:57:53] <aro> how can i pass content from an iframe to the parent window?
[03:59:50] <shwaiil> ps: tryed with $('document') too without success
[04:06:16] <kul> bartmax and scratcha nope its not solving the problem :(
[04:06:38] <hyper_ch> Hi there, I'm looking for a tooltip popup that could display a form and let you submit that form - this far I haven't found anything yet that could do it.
[04:06:51] <kul> I have 5 elements in my container and I display 1 element after another on click using next()
[04:07:12] <zelo> how can i add string to imgs src attribute before its actual content?
[04:07:33] <kul> but for last element .next() elem doesnt exisit so I want to jump from first again ...
[04:07:43] <kul> Struggling with it!
[04:10:11] <ansh> hi
[04:10:12] <ansh> all
[04:10:36] <ansh> has anyone worked on ajaxfileupload pluggin in javascript
[04:10:37] <ansh> ?
[04:10:55] <ansh> i m facing problem on sending data through it
[04:10:59] <ansh> .
[04:11:46] <ansh> is there anyone who can help me
[04:11:47] <ansh> ?
[04:13:39] <hyper_ch> I guess jQuery UI is what I'm looking for :)
[04:13:59] <bartmax> kul what .next() returns ?
[04:14:03] <bartmax> on the last element
[04:14:10] <bartmax> check of != than that
[04:17:13] <ansh> hello
[04:23:48] <snagnever> hey! i want to disable the click events on some buttons while tha ajax is loading and re-enable after that;
[04:24:27] <_ikke_> snagnever: Don't disable the events, but don't do anything in those events
[04:24:58] <snagnever> i have <div class="buttons"><a><a>...<a></div> and i'm using buttons.on('click',function(e){e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false;})
[04:25:09] <snagnever> _ikke_ meaning?
[04:25:21] <_ikke_> snagnever: I don't think that's going to work.
[04:25:31] <snagnever> it works with links only
[04:25:41] <snagnever> not with javascript click events :S
[04:25:58] <_ikke_> because propagation is something different
[04:26:40] <snagnever> _ikke_ what do you suggest?
[04:27:18] <_ikke_> somehow check in the events that a request is going on
[04:27:38] <_ikke_> But it also means a bit of duplication
[04:27:38] <snagnever> i've tried setting off('click') but than i can't simply turn it on :P
[04:27:46] <_ikke_> nope
[04:28:19] <_ikke_> jQuery(elem).data('events');
[04:28:22] <shwaiil> Q: Assuming I have Http://localhost/index.php?id=4#category=5&image=160, how could I remove #category=5&image=160 from url ? Thanks for looking.
[04:28:29] <_ikke_> You could get the events with that peace of code
[04:28:33] <_ikke_> and restore them afterwards
[04:28:49] <snagnever> _ikke_ humn, let me check... thx!
[04:30:34] <snagnever> _ikke_ what about using $(elm).data('disabled,true); and if ($this).data('disabled') return false ?
[04:31:56] <_ikke_> That's what my first approach was about
[04:32:34] <kul> batrmax it returns undefined
[04:33:07] <snagnever> _ikke_ the bad thing is that i would have to check that on all events... and anyways i'd have to use the preventDefault because of the anchors
[04:33:37] <_ikke_> yes
[04:36:38] <snagnever> $e.data('_events', $e.data('events'));$e.data('events', null); _ikke_ do you think that something like that will work?
[04:36:57] <snagnever> no ;P
[04:37:24] <AdvoWork> anyone got any ideas how I can extract data from datatables? its all in their properly, but can't work out how to extract it out :S
[04:37:50] <_ikke_> snagnever: As data is only a place to store those, it won't work
[04:38:13] <snagnever> yeah, obviously
[04:39:50] <snagnever> _ikke_ what about a dull overlay?
[04:39:59] <_ikke_> dull overlay?
[04:40:19] <iamamoron> hi there
[04:40:30] <snagnever> i mean, a empty div that does nothing over them
[04:40:31] <iamamoron> any ideas on how to delete an object created at runtime?
[04:41:06] <iamamoron> .remove() cannot see the object because it is created after push button
[04:41:19] <iamamoron> i want to delete an object created at run time
[04:41:23] <iamamoron> any ideas?

[04:42:51] <iamamoron> these divs are created during runtime
[04:42:59] <iamamoron> it doest exist at page load
[04:43:02] <endel> Hey guys, there is any way to inspect all events binded to a target element?
[04:43:40] <iamamoron> i put an id in every create
[04:43:45] <iamamoron> but it doesnt make sense
[04:43:55] <iamamoron> because it is created on the fly
[04:44:44] <_ikke_> endel: $('elem').data('events')
[04:45:03] <iamamoron> hwo about me?
[04:45:04] <iamamoron> :D
[04:47:30] <Pallet> hi all
[04:47:34] <MSK> I used superfish menus for project, In that I need when i mouseout from the submenus ,the submenus are keep on show
[04:48:11] <_ikke_> iamamoron: You can still attach event handlers to items created at runtime
[04:48:12] <Pallet> you know when you load jquery and it's usually $(.... how do you load it so it's, for example blah(....
[04:48:23] <_ikke_> Pallet: blah = $
[04:48:26] <iamamoron> how
[04:48:30] <Pallet> oh cool
[04:48:38] <_ikke_> Pallet: or blah = jQuery
[04:48:59] <_ikke_> iamamoron: How are those divs created
[04:49:01] <_ikke_> ?
[04:49:03] <iamamoron> how can i know to delete this particular div
[04:49:22] <_ikke_> iamamoron: How should I know?
[04:49:25] <iamamoron> i have a main div
[04:49:33] <iamamoron> then i prepend
[04:50:12] <iamamoron> var html="<div id='124545'>147</div>"
[04:50:15] <iamamoron> then
[04:50:38] <iamamoron> divmain.prepend(html)
[04:50:47] <devmikey> Question: I have an image I replace using AJAX every so often but the problem is, apparently sometimes the request times out which results in the image disappearing. Can jquery help me with this?
[04:51:41] <iamamoron> _ikke_: ?
[04:52:12] <_ikke_> And how is decided which divs should be deleted when you press on the button?
[04:53:28] <iamamoron> sorry inside this div var html = "<div id='1234'><input type='button' value='delthis'>"</div>"
[04:54:02] <_ikke_> iamamoron: Where does that ID come from?
[04:54:10] <snagnever> _ikke_ it works... until the element moves for some reason :P
[04:54:11] <iamamoron> from ajax
[04:54:19] <iamamoron> return from server
[04:54:24] <iamamoron> it is unique always
[04:55:29] <_ikke_> $('#<id> button').click(function(){$(this).parent().remove()})
[04:55:41] <_ikke_> Something like that
[04:55:59] <_ikke_> You add that after the prepend
[04:56:02] <techouse> anyone else having trouble connecting to jsfiddle.net?
[04:56:33] <_ikke_> yes
[04:56:36] <_ikke_> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/jsfiddle.net
[04:57:06] <techouse> anything remotely similar to jsfiddle?
[04:57:18] <techouse> *really* need it right now
[04:57:21] <_ikke_> Not that I'm aware of
[04:57:24] <techouse> :/
[04:57:25] <techouse> darn
[04:57:50] <snagnever> techouse http://www.similarsitesearch.com/alternatives-to/jsfiddle.net
[04:57:50] <_ikke_> js bin?
[04:58:01] <snagnever> 50 options there
[04:58:03] <_ikke_> http://jsbin.com/#javascript,html
[04:58:53] <devmikey> If I use a jquery function to replace an img's source instead of raw JS, will it avoid clobbering the old image in the event of a connection problem?
[04:58:55] <techouse> snagnever: just got it via google :D
[04:59:11] <techouse> devmikey: u mean canvas?
[04:59:14] <snagnever> techouse same here :P
[04:59:29] <devmikey> I don't know.  Do I?
[05:01:13] <devmikey> no I dont actually.
[05:03:42] <techouse> http://jsbin.com/isudum <-- any ideas why every 2nd child won't colour blue?
[05:04:06] <snagnever> _ikke_ the tricky thing is because when i use .off it will destroy the events; there's no 'cloning' for js objects without some good work
[05:04:51] <snagnever> what do you people do when there's a loading event and you don't want the user to click in the buttons?
[05:05:21] <snagnever> if i add another event do my buttons that would call preventPropagation & stuff if loading, might it work?
[05:05:39] <devmikey> I guess what I'm asking is, will $("#myImage").attr("src", "/path/to/newImage.jpg"); work better than document.getElementById('myImage').src = '/path/to/newImage.jpg'+'?'+Date.now();
[05:08:01] <devmikey> I was hoping that if the http connection required to get '/path/to/newImage.jpg' goes bad or whatever else is causing the image to be replaced by nothing, jquery might handle that automatically
[05:08:39] <scratcha> bare in mind that jquery is a javascript library, built on javascript, in javascript
[05:09:02] <devmikey> Yes, but it might be more robust JS than my JS
[05:09:31] <donCams> scratcha, that's like the us gov't is built for the people, by the people, of the people... but now it doesn't give a damn about people... off-topic, i know... gtg
[05:10:00] <scratcha> at least jQuery doesn't have ulterior motives .. ;P
[05:11:01] <donCams> i've been having conversations in facebook comment boxes that i was looking for the like button on your statement scratcha... :\ i need to get some sleep
[05:14:54] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. I'm making this quick view function (hover the bicycles). I would like to have a previous and next button, to go skip between products in the quick view. So if you quick view the green bicycle, and presses next, it should go to the white bicycle. Here's the javascript where I initiate the quick view: http://pastebin.com/MS7W3ZGe
[05:14:58] <jaffipaffi> Any ideas on how I can do that?
[05:15:18] <jaffipaffi>  I need something that can trigger the next quickviewbtn or something??+
[05:15:58] <snagnever> i spent alll that freaking time to fall back to check .attr('disabled') :(
[05:17:36] <donCams> jaffipaffi, .next() .prev()
[05:18:37] <luks89> a question: in JqueryUI autocomplete: What indicates the parameter data "autocomplete"??? =>>>>> }).data( "autocomplete" )._renderItem = function( ul, item ) {
[05:20:42] <wltoriginal> techouse: have you solved your problem?
[05:22:07] <techouse> wltoriginal: probably gonna use a more sophisticated method
[05:22:19] <techouse> involving some more vars :/
[05:22:27] <techouse> hold on...
[05:22:43] <techouse> ...tables a re a bit*h to style :P
[05:24:51] <jaffipaffi> donCams: But problem is that the quickviewbtn is INSIDE a parent. See this: http://pastebin.com/dww0CJiV
[05:25:14] <jaffipaffi> So should I do like $(this).parent().next('.quickviewbtn')??
[05:25:37] <devmikey> Question: How do you get an AJAX change using .attr("src",...) to take effect if the browser caches the old file?
[05:25:57] <techouse> devmikey: cache: false
[05:26:07] <devmikey> where?
[05:26:13] <techouse> in the ajax declaration
[05:26:29] <techouse> jQuery.ajax({cache: false})
[05:26:45] <luks89> Any help pleasE ?
[05:26:51] <donCams> jaffipaffi, yes
[05:27:19] <devmikey> So your options are to either have jQuery cache nothing or everything?
[05:27:24] <donCams> $(this).parent().next().find('.quickviewbtn'); try it... not really an exper
[05:27:26] <donCams> *expert
[05:29:02] <StPiere> is there something similar to serialize but  to get the Json object, {param:value} instead of string param=value&... ?
[05:29:57] <donCams> StPiere http://pastebin.com/yRPyzEJk
[05:30:45] <StPiere> thank you!
[05:30:51] <donCams> then use as $('elements').serializeObject(); it's what I use. i don't know if there are any other
[05:32:46] <StPiere> and this.serializeArray is built in?
[05:32:53] <StPiere> or need to be implemented
[05:32:55] <StPiere> ?
[05:33:42] <jaffipaffi> donCams: Think that worked
[05:33:43] <jaffipaffi> Thanks
[05:43:44] <JAAulde> g'morning jQuerians
[05:45:03] <prd> guys whats selector to use to find first child of element which id start with something like <div><div id="Child_0"></div></div> ?
[05:45:25] <prd> I know how to find first child and how to find element which id starts with something but not two of them at once
[05:46:53] <techouse> wltoriginal: fixed it kinda
[05:46:54] <techouse> http://jsbin.com/isudum/3
[05:47:24] <Taloncor1> prd: $("div[id|='Child']:first") ?
[05:48:23] <wltoriginal> techouse: glad to hear
[05:49:18] <prd> Taloncor1: could it be more genelar? I don't know if there will be div or table anbd i  need id to start with child lets say
[05:50:03] <AdvoWork> anyone got any ideas how I can extract data from datatables? its all in their properly, but can't work out how to extract it out :S
[05:51:05] <Taloncor1> prd: $("[id|='child']:first)
[05:52:51] <BG> using http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation, how can I enforce at least one of two fields to be filled-in?
[05:58:54] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone im trying to figure out a simple statement syntax
[05:58:56] <jarr0dsz>       #image{:onClick => "document.forms['invite'].closest.submit();"}
[05:59:08] <jarr0dsz> driving me crazy anyone knows how to submit the closest form onclick?
[05:59:43] <jarr0dsz>       #image{:onClick => "document.forms['invite'].submit();"}
[05:59:43] <jarr0dsz> works fine but then it submits the 1st form ( i have multiple )
[05:59:55] <jeffreylevesque> does anyone have time to look at my rotator: http://jsfiddle.net/YpW3a/14/?
[06:00:18] <jeffreylevesque> I'm trying to apply thumbnail(), so clicking the thumbnail updates the main rotator
[06:02:42] <prd> Taloncor1: actually this worked better  $("[id^='Child']:first"
[06:03:51] <Taloncor1> prd: Sorry, you are right ofc. |= would only work for "child-"ish IDs.
[06:04:12] <prd> Taloncor1: no worries, thx for tip
[06:04:43] <JaredCE> hi all. i'm using Chosen http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ and the multiselect.  i have an change event set so i can get the id of the item chosen, however it only gives me the id of the first item
[06:06:01] <JaredCE> i meant value, not id. i want to get the value everytime someone selects something
[06:07:54] <JaredCE> i'm currently using: $("#contacttribename option:selected").val()
[06:11:21] <JaredCE> hmm $(this).val() gives me something like 1 then 1,2 then 1,2,3.  is there a way of getting the seperate values
[06:15:14] <jeffsmykil> So I have apage thats supposed to make an ajax call, and it doesn't hit the success or fail instead I get this: Sys.ArgumentTypeException: Object of type 'String' cannot be converted to type 'Function'. Parameter name: onSuccess .  This was working yesterday, and I don't remember changing anything that would have affected the script.
[06:15:44] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: paste your code somewhere
[06:16:08] <jeffsmykil> yeah, i really can't I was just looking for a hunch
[06:16:22] <chrisinajar> you can't?
[06:16:36] <chrisinajar> 99% chance you have a parameter wrong.
[06:16:39] <chrisinajar> that's my hunch
[06:16:50] <jeffsmykil>  ok
[06:16:55] <jeffsmykil> thats something to go on
[06:17:08] <chrisinajar> well, it says it can't convert a string to a function
[06:17:19] <chrisinajar> and the error says stuff about parameters
[06:17:42] <chrisinajar> so it looks like there's a function excepting a function() { } paramater and is instead receiving a "string"
[06:17:57] <jeffsmykil> so strange it was fine yesterday
[06:18:29] <chrisinajar> it probably wants
[06:18:32] <chrisinajar> *wasn't
[06:19:04] <jeffsmykil> yeah, you are probably right.  It just makes me feel better if I say it was
[06:20:44] <chrisinajar> wouldn't it make you feel better to know that programming is deterministic?
[06:20:57] <chrisinajar> i wouldn't want code to change behavior without modification
[06:21:07] <chrisinajar> i would call that the opposite of "feeling better"
[06:23:03] <BinaryMaster> http://jsfiddle.net/MAgAt/  <----- can anyone tell me why I have a gap?
[06:24:02] <bestKoderEver> hi guys
[06:24:40] <bestKoderEver> i have this button 'Accepted' , when clicked.. it should display 'Start' instead.. any ideas?
[06:25:26] <BinaryMaster> ui button?
[06:25:59] <chrisinajar> BinaryMaster: "gap"?
[06:26:01] <bestKoderEver> So it should just change text.. but when pressed for the second time, when it show 'start' , then it should sumbit to the server..
[06:26:17] <BinaryMaster> chrisinajar, yes there is a space in the animation
[06:26:27] <bestKoderEver> BinaryMaster hehe like ur nick.. its an ASP .net button..
[06:27:28] <chrisinajar> BinaryMaster: there's no space in the animation for me
[06:27:48] <BinaryMaster> bestKoderEver, I would have the first click change the button text and add a attribute that you test for if there submit
[06:27:51] <chrisinajar> BinaryMaster: although i did decrease your mls-listingbox-container by 5 pixels so that it doesn't look weird
[06:28:32] <BinaryMaster> chrisinajar, the first box doesn't get removed before the animation for you?
[06:28:39] <alex88> is something wrong with this? i'm trying to set placeholder plugin to all elements with placeholder attr also those created in the future.. $(document).on('load','input[placeholder], textarea[placeholder]',function(e){ $(this).placeholder(); });
[06:29:11] <alex88> if i just use $('input[placeholder], textarea[placeholder]').placeholder(); that works, but ofc not on future elements
[06:30:24] <BinaryMaster> chrisinajar, are you on windows and what browser are you using if I may ask
[06:31:31] <jeffsmykil> chrisinajar: Not that you care, but somehowe the underlying service code got changed, might have been an SVN hiccup
[06:31:45] <adac> Guys, is this wrong? http://pastebin.com/N2M5e6Zi
[06:33:28] <BinaryMaster> adac, looks good but I would delegate to the body
[06:33:54] <adac> BinaryMaster, how do you mean that?
[06:34:12] <adac> BinaryMaster, on jsfiddle this works. within my project unfortunately it does not
[06:34:23] <BinaryMaster> $('body').delegate('selector', 'event', 'function');
[06:34:24] <adac> BinaryMaster, see: http://jsfiddle.net/Jz7eH/2/
[06:35:08] <zelo> how can i trigger javascript code  before browser start downloading images?
[06:35:09] <chrisinajar> BinaryMaster: chrome
[06:35:15] <BinaryMaster> $("body").delegate("#ontoevo-version-one","change",function(){
[06:35:15] <BinaryMaster>     alert("malert")
[06:35:15] <BinaryMaster> });
[06:35:16] <alex88> what event fires when an element is created? ready? load?
[06:35:52] <adac> BinaryMaster, what does body stand for?
[06:36:08] <BinaryMaster> yeah I'm using chrome too, on linux I have seen some differences in the way js fires between windows chrome and linux
[06:36:09] <chrisinajar> the body of the html document
[06:36:18] <BinaryMaster> adac, document body
[06:36:24] <chrisinajar> BinaryMaster: shouldn't. what do you see?
[06:38:01] <adac> BinaryMaster, it works with body also in my project :)
[06:38:14] <adac> BinaryMaster, thank you a  whole lot!!
[06:42:44] <bestKoderEver> BinaryMaster would you call on a JS script that changes the button text..onClick.. or ? :D
[06:48:31] <up7> hey guys, what is supposed to happen to an ajax call when the server response has Transfer-Encoding: chunked in the headers ?
[06:48:55] <up7> does it wait until it gets all the content or does it return immediately ?
[06:50:01] <MrTrick> up7: at a guess, it depends on the server. A node.js server might do something strangely interesting, but I'd expect a php server to wait.
[06:51:24] <sviatovigt> hi
[06:51:35] <sviatovigt> I have a detached element
[06:51:43] <sviatovigt> if I try to get it's value
[06:51:47] <sviatovigt> I will get undefined
[06:51:59] <sviatovigt> how can I alter detached elements
[06:52:07] <sviatovigt> where are they placed in the DOM
[06:52:07] <sviatovigt> ?
[06:54:44] <chrisinajar> sviatovigt: paste your code into a jsfiddle, and define "detached"
[07:01:44] <hazamonzo> What was the name of the Jquery UI selectors plugin?
[07:02:25] <jedmtnman> is there a way to re-render the icon sprite to a larger size icon? are the vectors for creating the file in the jquery repo?
[07:03:42] <Famic> hi
[07:05:22] <Taloncor1> sviatovigt: It won't be in the DOM after you detached it. Thats what the detach function is for
[07:07:36] <Taloncor1> sviatovigt: if you want to access the value and/or change it you have to store the element in a variable
[07:09:24] <sviatovigt> jsfiddle is barely working again
[07:09:38] <sviatovigt> I don't know if I will be able to save my code there
[07:12:48] <hex`> does jQuery still uses eval() to deserialize JSON or is there a nw way?
[07:13:23] <HarryPitfall> AFAIK, it's use the json if is avaiable

[07:14:25] <hex`> ok
[07:14:38] <Taloncor1> sviatovigt: Minimal working example http://jsfiddle.net/8H4Qy/1/

[07:15:44] <raadad> hey dudes
[07:16:53] <raadad> how could i write a jquery selector to select line 7 http://pastebin.com/cuSwBq4z
[07:17:01] <raadad> this is shitting me :(
[07:17:03] <Taloncor1> sviatovigt: Do you read what i write?
[07:17:31] <raadad> any help would be greatly apprecaited
[07:17:35] <raadad> *appreciated
[07:18:05] <sviatovigt> I did after I wrote you
[07:18:22] <sviatovigt> but it's killing me because I have a lot of vars
[07:18:42] <Taloncor1> raadad: That won't work because the ID-Attribute may not contain a '#'
[07:20:22] <raadad> :) thanks bro :D
[07:20:22] <sviatovigt> Taloncor1: can you please tell me on my example
[07:20:46] <Taloncor1> raadad: And you have to ensure that your IDs are unique!
[07:20:52] <sviatovigt> how can I access elements detached using that var that I have defined?
[07:22:17] <jeffreylevesque> how do you check if an element has a particular css style?
[07:22:34] <jeffreylevesque> if ( ('.rotator-' + l).css('display') == 'list-item' ) {} ?
[07:23:03] <Famic> .hasClass()
[07:23:48] <Taloncor1> sviatovigt: First of all you need to watch the scope for the variable. If you want to access it from everywhere it has to be global. Then you just search via blockPersonalSection.find("#age")
[07:23:54] <Famic> err, I misread.
[07:24:00] <nFFFFF> any regex dudes here?
[07:24:03] <sviatovigt> ok
[07:24:04] <sviatovigt> thanks
[07:24:07] <sviatovigt> it is global
[07:24:15] <sviatovigt> it is defined global
[07:24:22] <Famic> nFFFFF: as always, just ask, you'll see. #regex would probably be better though
[07:24:27] <jeffreylevesque> Famic: what if I want to check if an element is being displayed 'list-item'
[07:24:36] <Taloncor1> sviatovigt: In your example it is defined in the click handler

[07:25:19] <phrearch> hi
[07:25:27] <MrTrick> if I have two jquery elements, A, and B (cells in different rows), what's the most concise way to swap them?
[07:25:36] <phrearch> if i $.get an svg file, the data type is Document
[07:25:41] <eternity13> $_script = end(explode('/',$_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"])); // Strict Standards: Only variables should be passed by reference // how am i supposed to fix this?
[07:25:52] <phrearch> any idea if i can use jquery selectors inside the document somehow?
[07:26:07] <Famic> jeffreylevesque: what you wrote looks fine, except for the missing $
[07:26:18] <sviatovigt> Taloncor1: if I do this on my example: console.log(blockPersonalSection.find('#age').val()); I will get the value 0
[07:26:44] <Famic> nFFFFF: that's a classic, I'm sure you'll find it easily with a bit of googling
[07:26:44] <tooter_> nFFFFF using mod_rewrite? :)
[07:26:52] <JaredCE> what syntax do i need to do a remove of all <li> items with a certain class?
[07:27:05] <jeffreylevesque> Thanks Famic: I keep forgetting syntax between php and jquery
[07:27:11] <jeffreylevesque> Famic++
[07:27:23] <Famic> JaredCE: $('.class').remove()
[07:27:27] <eternity13> where can i find php freenode?
[07:27:42] <Famic> eternity13: /join #php
[07:28:00] <eternity13> Famic: it says invite only
[07:28:19] <Famic> must be temporary
[07:28:21] <tooter_> i mean nFFFFFF - it is a simple rewrite you are trying to achieve, or do you actual need a regex..
[07:28:32] <Famic> try efnet if you really need help
[07:28:40] <eternity13> o
[07:28:41] <eternity13> ok
[07:29:08] <Famic> eternity13: I just joined #php no pb
[07:31:22] <JaredCE> nice one Famic
[07:32:54] <nFFFFF> tooter_
[07:32:57] <nFFFFF> Im not even sure
[07:33:07] <nFFFFF> just want all '/' trailing urls gone
[07:33:28] <Famic> nFFFFF: where ?
[07:33:58] <nFFFFF> opn a website: want all 'url/' to 301 to 'url' i.e. remove the '/'
[07:35:05] <Famic> then you want a classic mod_rewrite rule in a .htaccess file
[07:35:51] <nFFFFF> Famic, do you know it by anychane
[07:37:18] <Famic> nFFFFF: nope, I usually do the opposite (add a trailing slash)
[07:37:33] <Famic> check http://corz.org/serv/tricks/htaccess2.php
[07:37:39] <Famic> or http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/RewriteQueryString
[07:37:51] <donics> Is that a no on loading multiple jquery ui versions on the same page?
[07:38:09] <Famic> donics: why would you wanna do that ?
[07:38:46] <donics> Famic: we have a page where users can load their own plugins, and some of them are downloading plugins that need specific ui versions
[07:38:55] <donics> s/plugins/controls/
[07:39:33] <Famic> I don't believe you can do that
[07:39:38] <donics> the issue is that the page may have several different controls that all use different versions. noConflict handles the jquery side, but i'm not seeing anything for ui
[07:39:43] <donics> yeah, it's looking that way to me too
[07:40:14] <Famic> drop a mail on their website, maybe you'll get lucky
[07:40:24] <donics> couldn't hurt, could it
[07:40:43] <donics> does anyone know when the UI devs are active on here?
[07:42:38] <LoRd`uni> hi guys, is there a simple way if I've to elements (absolute + zindex) to find the element which is partly laying above the element I've clicked on?
[07:44:07] <Famic> LoRd`uni: firebug should help you with that
[07:44:22] <joelones> Hello Guys, new here.
[07:44:23] <LoRd`uni> i want to have the element in js
[07:45:20] <LoRd`uni> something like $('#foo').click(function() { $(this).findOverLayingElement(); ... });
[07:45:37] <joelones> I am writing a jqm app and would like to retreive data from a server and store it locally. I think I know how to store, but wondering I would I go about making a request to get that image in the first place?
[07:45:44] <Famic> LoRd`uni: you can take advantage of events bubbling for that
[07:46:17] <Famic> joelones: check .ajax()
[07:48:35] <joelones> I tried to use the $.getImageData plugin found here: http://www.maxnov.com/getimagedata/ but does not work. I will look into .ajax.
[07:49:33] <joelones> Must it be stored in base64? I would like to display the image as well as include it in an email via the EmailComposer plugin
[07:53:03] <risky_s> if you display a <p> as none can Google or any other search engine crawl that and recognise or does it have to be displayed for crawling?
[07:53:15] <risky_s> dsiplay:none i mean
[07:54:21] <JaredCE> is anyone here using Chosen?
[07:54:23] <donics> i think it ignores display:none which is why you see a lot of blackhat SEOs using whitespace instead
[07:54:32] <donics> er white/unreadable text
[07:54:33] <donics> not whitespace
[07:55:01] <joelones> I'm not quite sure how to do it with .ajax and base64?
[07:55:30] <Famic> risky_s: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=66353
[07:55:39] <risky_s> oh right, so they make that content hidden in a way if they need display:none and need still need SEO?
[07:56:25] <joelones> I'm looking at the jQ .ajax doc and can't find any mention of base64 images
[08:00:13] <risky_s> so how do I make sure the Googlebot tracks my paragragh if its display:none?
[08:00:57] <phil-adept> hi all.
[08:01:08] <Famic> risky_s: did you read the link ?
[08:01:25] <risky_s> yer
[08:01:29] <donics> risky_s: it looks like the most acceptable way would be to hide it with js
[08:01:41] <donics> so, when the page loads with no js, it should be fully visible
[08:02:09] <Famic> that's correct, but even better : don't try to trick the bots, show real content to both users and bots
[08:02:50] <donics> exactly
[08:03:12] <risky_s> you see the content on my page shows only when the use clicks on a page, my website has no page loading, the pages are loaded as divs with jquery
[08:03:21] <phil-adept> quick q).. what is the best method of taking a form <select> element and removing it (when it becomes obsolete) and storing it somewhere (either in a js var or hidden element outside of its own <form> so it's not submitted) so that it can be retrieved if needed later?...
[08:04:54] <Zeph88> I have a div being added to the screen using a script, when the new divs are added though they are being added to the side of the pre-exsisting div and not being layerd over the top?
[08:05:59] <phil-adept> any example script Zeph88?
[08:06:16] <Zeph88> I'll try to copy one out, it's in a secured site
[08:07:23] <john> phil-adept: you could always just remove the select and placing it in a hidden element outside of the form until you need it again
[08:07:24] <Famic> Zeph88: that's normal html behaviour
[08:07:27] <phil-adept> are you positioning the div's correctly? i.e. relative / absolute pos? z-index?
[08:08:03] <Zeph88> I found it, I'm a dork, I wasn't applying the class correctly apparently
[08:10:03] <phil-adept> john: cheers for that. I know there's a lot of ways to achieve this and couldn't decide. I as going to go with destroying the element and re-rendering it using AJAX & JSON but I couldn't be arsed writting a function or the back-end dev. Anyone else have any objections to John's suggestion?
[08:10:43] <ajpiano> phil-adept: you don't have to "place" it anywhere
[08:10:55] <ajpiano> you can just remove it from the DOM, keep it in memory, and put it back when you need it
[08:10:57] <phil-adept> Zeph88: It happens fella :D Sometimes just explaining to other people helps you see things you've missed after hours of staring at it ;)
[08:11:08] <ajpiano> var elem = $("#elem").detach();   elem.appendTo("#form")
[08:11:16] <keystr0k> Is there a cleaner, more concise way to do this:
[08:11:17] <keystr0k> $(this).parent().parent().siblings("#edit-varprice-wrapper").fadeOut("slow");
[08:11:25] <Famic> phil-adept: .clone() might help you
[08:11:28] <phil-adept> ajpiano: that was another idea to "store" it as a var or similar. I didn't know the terminology! :)
[08:11:38] <ajpiano> keystr0k: $("#edit-varprice-wrapper").fadeOut("slow")
[08:11:51] <ajpiano> keystr0k: there should be, by definition, only one #edit-varprice-wrapper
[08:11:54] <ajpiano> in the entire DOM
[08:12:00] <keystr0k> ajpiano: there may be multiple instancesâ€¦ so I want to only get the one within the same parent parent parent
[08:12:04] <keystr0k> OH!
[08:12:07] <keystr0k> ajpiano:  you're right.
[08:12:14] <ajpiano> :)
[08:12:15] <keystr0k> good call
[08:12:59] <jeffreylevesque> ['apple', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape'].. how do i remove one of the 'apple's
[08:13:09] <ajpiano> eat it
[08:13:16] <john> lol
[08:13:35] <Taloncor1> ajpiano: Damn it. You type fast then i do ;)
[08:13:38] <keystr0k> ajpiano:  thank you.
[08:13:47] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = ['apple', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape']; foo.pop();  foo;
[08:13:48] <Taloncor1> s/fast/faster
[08:13:49] <bot-t1> ajpiano: ["apple", "apple", "orange"]
[08:13:59] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = ['apple', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape']; foo.shift();  foo;
[08:14:00] <bot-t1> ajpiano: ["apple", "orange", "grape"]
[08:14:05] <phil-adept> ajpiano: Cheers, I'll look into .detach() and .clone() as I have never used them before and .appendTo() as I'll need to figure out how to specify 'where' in the markup it will need to be placed :D
[08:14:28] <ajpiano> phil-adept: you can remove it from the DOM with .detach() or .remove() .. detach just preserves event handlers and element data
[08:14:34] <joelones> What must be my contentype in my ajax call to retreive image base64 data?
[08:14:45] <ajpiano> jeffreylevesque: use .shift or .slice
[08:15:46] <phil-adept> ajpiano: Sweet. Cheers bud :)
[08:16:12] <ajpiano> welcome!
[08:17:22] <joelones> anyone?
[08:18:04] <jeffreylevesque> ajpiano: this may be helpful for me - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/ :)
[08:18:15] <ajpiano> jeffreylevesque: nope, it only works on arrays of DOM elements
[08:18:22] <jeffreylevesque> dang
[08:18:52] <jeffreylevesque> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/840781/easiest-way-to-find-duplicate-values-in-a-javascript-array
[08:18:55] <jeffreylevesque> i think that's my answer
[08:19:36] <techouse> if i got an option's value set to an integer, say <option value="123" /> what do i use as the jQuery selector? $('option[value=123]') or $('option[value="123"]')?
[08:20:19] <techouse> i know it works both ways but what is more correct?
[08:21:12] <john> probably it'd be more correct without quotes now days
[08:21:16] <Famic> $('option').val()
[08:21:31] <john> quotes were necessary with with strict XHTML since it was derived from XML
[08:21:41] <john> now days quotes aren't necessary for attributes
[08:21:47] <ajpiano> john: that's incorrect
[08:21:54] <ajpiano> techouse: use the quotes
[08:21:56] <john> :o
[08:22:07] <ajpiano> the quotes are necessary for the selector to be processed by querySelectorAll
[08:22:16] <ajpiano> otherwise it goes through Sizzle instead of taking the native path so it's slower
[08:22:23] <john> I see
[08:22:30] <techouse> ajpiano: tnx
[08:22:46] <john> i just assumed since it's not necessary in the html itself
[08:22:49] <t0mas> hi
[08:23:01] <Famic> it's better in html too
[08:23:02] <ajpiano> yes but that's a separate discussion :p
[08:23:06] <techouse> john: i use it in html with quotes
[08:23:20] <john> most people do
[08:23:34] <t0mas> I was wondering if there is a way to determine a valid selector for a clicked element. I have an event handler for "click" on document, the user clicks an element and now I would like to get a selector that matches that element for future usage
[08:23:37] <techouse> dunno, if i used it w/o my ide would shout at me
[08:24:01] <john> you'll probably start to see it less and less in html though
[08:24:03] <Famic> t0mas: depending on the usage, it could just be $(this)
[08:24:05] <techouse> t0mas: add a selected class?
[08:24:17] <ajpiano> john: techouse http://mothereff.in/unquoted-attributes
[08:24:41] <Famic> http://webdesign.about.com/od/html5tags/f/quotes-required-html-5-attributes.htm
[08:24:44] <t0mas> Famic, techouse: unfortunately I need to store the selector for later usage when (automatically) downloading the page server-side, I basically want to get the content that the user pointed out
[08:25:09] <techouse> make an ajax call to save the data to an sql table
[08:25:13] <Famic> t0mas: then probably adding a class is the easiest
[08:25:18] <john> htmmm
[08:25:25] <Famic> but yeah, I'd go with ajax too
[08:25:55] <Famic> depens on what you intend to do really, just remember the KISS principle
[08:26:34] <t0mas> Famic: that wouldn't work? This is an existing page which is displayed to the user, I insert a bit of javascript into the page to allow the user to "select" an element (click an item), I then capture that event and want to do an AJAX post to the server to remember which element (on an external page) was clicked. This selector is then to be used by the server to check the page daily and tell the user about changes to the selected element
[08:26:48] <jeffreylevesque> arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']; arr2 = ['1', '2'];
[08:26:57] <jeffreylevesque> if i say arr1 = arr2;
[08:27:00] <t0mas> Famic: so I can't change the page to add a class
[08:27:06] <jeffreylevesque> then arr1 = ['1', '2'];?
[08:27:37] <pifantastic> ?eval arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']; arr2 = ['1', '2']; arr1 = arr2; arr1 = ['1', '2']; arr1;
[08:27:37] <bot-t1> pifantastic: ["1", "2"]
[08:27:40] <NoiseEee> t0mas: personally i'd assign it a unique ID for future reference, or depending on how you wanted to call it, you could just throw it in an object
[08:27:59] <pifantastic> jeffreylevesque: yes
[08:28:05] <jeffreylevesque> you the boss
[08:28:07] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[08:28:13] <Famic> t0mas: what's the end goal ?
[08:28:20] <t0mas> NoiseEee: It's not my page, it's just a random external page in an Iframe
[08:28:29] <Famic> how many seleactable elements are there on the page ?
[08:28:39] <t0mas> Famic: To allow the user to point at an element in some random webpage which will then be "monitored" for them
[08:28:43] <thang> sounds like AB comparisons with js
[08:29:16] <Famic> t0mas: assuming the page doesn't change, you may get some interesting approach with xpath
[08:30:03] <t0mas> I could indeed execute xpath or jquery selectors sever-side to fetch the data, that isn't really hard, but I somehow need to determine the xpath to use (client-side, using only jquery)
[08:30:29] <t0mas> so I would basically need something like $(this).xpathToThisElement(); in the event-handler :-)
[08:31:49] <techouse> btw, what's the best method to add a node? create it with var myDiv = document.createElement('div') and then $.('#someId').append(myDiv) or directly $.('#someId').append('<div>lalala</div>') '
[08:31:51] <techouse> ?
[08:32:22] <thang> former just seems better for future-proofing
[08:32:27] <ajpiano> whattttt
[08:32:43] <ajpiano> the former isn't even possible, it's invalid syntax
[08:32:52] <Iszak> techhelp2: the later is most likely slower.
[08:33:05] <techouse> Iszak: i'm aware of that
[08:33:11] <ajpiano> $("<div>").appendTo("whatever") or $("whatever").append("<div>")
[08:33:34] <ajpiano> or $(document.createElement("div")).appendTo("whatever") if you're concerned about insignificant performance boosts
[08:33:44] <Iszak> it's all about the POWER
[08:33:49] <Iszak> I mean performance.
[08:34:02] <techouse> yea, u can has ram but u can't has cpu :D
[08:34:22] <joelones> my $.ajax request always runs on error; $.ajax({
[08:34:43] <NoiseEee> Iszak: its all about *perceptible* performance.
[08:35:10] <joelones> imageUrl is the following: https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=120x120&cht=qr&chl=http://company.com/job11-002
[08:35:16] <Iszak> yeah because we're all delusional.
[08:35:17] <joelones> (sorry for the mess)
[08:35:42] <Iszak> oh god my eyes
[08:36:17] <Iszak> joelones: you're trying to load that image via AJAX?
[08:36:19] <Famic> t0mas: check that http://stackoverflow.com/questions/881768/what-is-the-unique-identifier-for-a-dom-element-node
[08:37:41] <t0mas> Famic: Thanks I'll try that one
[08:42:56] <phil-adept> ajpiano: Thanks a bunch fella. Managed to get that sorted now with minimal effort and back-end dev. Leg end http://pastie.org/3244353
[08:46:02] <dabear_> phil-adept: lol at your comments
[08:46:13] <alexr2> been having a few issues with fadein/fadeout.  if you're not focused on the window it's running, it starts working strangly.  here's jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/DJRuE/
[08:46:13] <dabear_>  else { // otherwise
[08:46:26] <dabear_> that's kinda streching it
[08:46:33] <alexr2> just start it, change tabs and wait a little bit, and you'll see
[08:47:15] <phil-adept> it's tongue in cheek lol... // stick it back in the markup in it's original place aint exactly correct either lol... I have a sense of humour :D
[08:47:38] <joelones> If I specify 'application/octet-stream' as the contentType is this base64? I'm trying to retreive a png file and would like to then markup some html with it?
[08:48:57] <joelones> The 'data' that's retreived from this ajax call. can it then be marked up like so: "<img " + "src='" + "data:image/jpg;base64," + data + "'/>";
[08:50:54] <dabear_> joelones: are you using php serverside? that would work if you did echo base64_encode(file_get_contents(..))
[08:51:31] <joelones> dabear: no server side. all client based on jqm
[08:51:59] <joelones> the url is a qrcode generator from google that creates a png file
[08:52:46] <dabear_> then you would have to base64_encode the response from jquery first
[08:52:59] <joelones> interesingly in weinre for that image div i see a lot of gibberish representing the image data
[08:53:16] <dabear_> i.e. the data you receive is not base64
[08:53:57] <joelones> so in the success function, i need to base64 encode it?
[08:54:37] <dabear_> if you wanna use base64 encoding, yes
[08:55:37] <joelones> I'm not sure what I want to use to be honnest, but I'd like also to save this image to localStorage as well to use to include in an email from the device
[08:55:48] <dabear_> you may wanna look into http://www.maxnov.com/getimagedata/
[08:55:51] <dabear_> or similar
[08:55:55] <dabear_> I haven't tried them
[08:56:23] <joelones> totally, I did, it just wasn't working at all, always returned error in my case
[08:56:33] <dabear_> you can use app manifests
[08:56:35] <dabear_> http://www.google.no/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=html5+manifest
[08:56:46] <dabear_> first result here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/offline.html
[08:58:14] <joelones> was planning to use localStorage.setItem("photo", "data:image/jpeg;base64," + imageData);
[08:58:23] <joelones> once i figure out how to encode the imagedata
[08:59:28] <joelones> dabear, is there a builtin to encode to base64?
[08:59:31] <pifantastic> kinda
[08:59:47] <pifantastic> ?eval atob('test')
[08:59:48] <bot-t1> pifantastic: ReferenceError: atob is not defined
[09:00:03] <pifantastic> joelones: Mozilla supports btoa and atob
[09:00:30] <pifantastic> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.btoa#Unicode_Strings
[09:01:25] <joelones> pifantastic, would that work for a jqm + phonegapp app?
[09:01:25] <janthony> Does anyone know how to get images to fade in IE so the transition looks smooth when using the jQuery cycle plugin?
[09:03:53] <pifantastic> joelones: are you targeting webkit?
[09:04:29] <joelones> pifantastic, iso + android?
[09:04:36] <joelones> probably
[09:04:42] <joelones> iOS*
[09:04:43] <pifantastic> joelones: it probably works, you'll have to test it
[09:04:51] <cyberrog> hello, I have a problem using getJSON function. The server returns the json, but I try to log the data, and the function is not even reached. http://pastebin.com/QZxtvgaS
[09:04:53] <pifantastic> which is easy enough
[09:05:00] <pifantastic> just plop alert(atob(btoa('test'))) in your code somewhere
[09:05:07] <pifantastic> and if it doesn't alert 'test' you have a problem
[09:05:15] <cyberrog> I have no idea its not working. The server logs the JSON and returns it, but Im unable to retrieve it.. any idea?
[09:06:22] <pifantastic> cyberrog: are there any errors in the console?
[09:06:57] <cyberrog> pifantastic, no..
[09:08:15] <joelones> pifantastic, thanks. i get "INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: DOM Exception 5: An invalid or illegal character was specified, such as in an XML name." when I tried to 'btoa(imgdata)'
[09:08:17] <pifantastic> cyberrog: and you can see that the request is successful?
[09:08:24] <pifantastic> It's nto returning a 404 or something?
[09:08:55] <cyberrog> pifantastic, well, in server I log the returnment, and everything is ok, The server is being called, it returns the json, but I cant retrieve it with the success function in getJSON
[09:09:06] <pifantastic> cyberrog: also, you don't need "&callback=?" if the JSON request is hitting your own server, that's just for JSONP
[09:09:07] <cyberrog> pifantastic, no 404
[09:09:14] <cyberrog> pifantastic, its another server
[09:09:28] <pifantastic> cyberrog: and you can see the response in Firebug or Inspector?
[09:09:37] <pifantastic> cyberrog: so maybe you need to add the domain?
[09:09:42] <pifantastic> because you are using a relative path
[09:09:47] <cyberrog> pifantastic, i can see it in appengine logs
[09:10:00] <pifantastic> cyberrog: but do you see it in the browser?
[09:10:04] <cyberrog> pifantastic, yeah..
[09:10:19] <cyberrog> pifantastic, i tryied the url in the browser, and the json is printed
[09:10:33] <alexr2> been having a few issues with fadein/fadeout.  if you're not focused on the window it's running, it starts working strangly.  here's jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/DJRuE/ just start it up, change tabs and wait a little bit, and you'll see what's happening
[09:11:09] <pifantastic> cyberrog: I dont understand how you have a request for JSON that hits another server but you are using a relative path
[09:11:28] <cyberrog> pifantastic, actually, the url is in this format.. http://mysite.com/filter?,.,,,,
[09:11:33] <cyberrog> pifantastic, I misstyped
[09:11:38] <pifantastic> alexr2: it's probably using requestAnimationFrame
[09:11:44] <danols_work> hi all
[09:11:53] <danols_work> how can I do .animate({'margin-right': '0% !important'}); ?
[09:12:00] <danols_work> the !important prevents it from working
[09:12:13] <pifantastic> cyberrog: take a screenshot of the successful response in Firebug or Inspector
[09:12:26] <pifantastic> danols_work: don't use !important
[09:12:35] <danols_work> pifantastic: i have to
[09:12:38] <pifantastic> danols_work: animate adds inline styels
[09:12:42] <pifantastic> so no you don't
[09:12:45] <cyberrog> pifantastic, what do u mean? u mean the response the server returns??
[09:12:48] <pifantastic> inline styles always overide stylesheet styles
[09:12:49] <danols_work> well it dosen't work
[09:12:52] <pifantastic> cyberrog: yes
[09:12:56] <cyberrog> pifantastic, im not using firebug

[09:13:04] <pifantastic> cyberrog: what are you using?
[09:13:05] <danols_work> !importnat overrides the animation
[09:13:12] <danols_work> when I disable it in firefox then it works
[09:13:18] <cyberrog> pifantastic, the server I print in appengine logs
[09:13:19] <danols_work> (the css !important style)
[09:13:25] <alexr2> pifantastic right now i have a second loop checking for extras and just removing them, but is ther any way to properly remove things without that second loop?
[09:13:26] <cyberrog> pifantastic, my server is GAE
[09:13:36] <pifantastic> alexr2: requestAnimationFrame will pause any animations when the window loses focus (to save CPU)
[09:13:57] <pifantastic> cyberrog: I dont care about the server
[09:14:09] <pifantastic> cyberrog: what browser or client are you using?
[09:14:22] <alexr2> is there like a tab.isFocused() type of thing?
[09:14:24] <cyberrog> pifantastic, chrome.
[09:14:24] <danols_work> so the !important in the files css prevents my animation from working
[09:14:31] <danols_work> what is going on ?
[09:14:38] <pifantastic> cyberrog: do you know how to use Chrome Inspector
[09:14:39] <pifantastic> ?
[09:14:44] <cyberrog> pifantastic, yeah
[09:14:48] <cyberrog> pifantastic, im using the console

[09:15:22] <pifantastic> cyberrog: http://grimhappy.com/i/f17b47.png
[09:15:32] <pifantastic> cyberrog: use the network tab to inspect the getJSON request/response
[09:15:46] <danols_work> please come join - I will show how !important is overding the css inline style
[09:15:49] <cyberrog> pifantastic, ok
[09:15:53] <danols_work> of the animation
[09:15:57] <pifantastic> wtf danols_work, no
[09:15:59] <pifantastic> use jsfiddle
[09:16:02] <pifantastic> ?p @ danols_work
[09:16:02] <bot-t1> danols_work, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:16:05] <danols_work> wtf no
[09:16:08] <danols_work> nm
[09:16:20] <cyberrog> pifantastic, ive tested, in response there is the json
[09:16:28] <danols_work> i wouldn't even know how to re-write this code in a jsfiddle
[09:16:34] <cyberrog> pifantastic, status code = 200
[09:16:43] <joelones> pifantastic, i think i'm missing something, if I make a request to get the png, how would I include in the html?
[09:16:48] <pifantastic> cyberrog: can you paste the _exact_ code?
[09:17:08] <joelones> <img src=" + data + "/> would not do it?
[09:17:10] <pifantastic> joelones: you are making a request for a png, and getting it as base64?
[09:17:22] <pifantastic> joelones: you have to specify that it is a data uri
[09:17:28] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/EkU7G/1/
[09:17:30] <cyberrog> pifantastic, u mean with the correct url, etc??
[09:17:32] <andrew9183> anyone know why this won't work ?
[09:17:38] <pifantastic> joelones: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/data_URIs
[09:17:43] <pifantastic> cyberrog: yeah
[09:18:43] <cyberrog> pifantastic, sorry. but i cant.
[09:18:59] <pifantastic> andrew9183: $div = $('div.content'); is alway going to select the first div.content
[09:19:05] <cyberrog> pifantastic, its company's rules.
[09:19:06] <danols_work> how can I add !important to the .animate() ?
[09:19:10] <danols_work> is it possible
[09:19:12] <pifantastic> cyberrog: you can change the url
[09:19:24] <NoiseEee> andrew9183: google "same origin policy"
[09:19:25] <cyberrog> ok
[09:19:47] <cyberrog> pifantastic, its the same code I gave in pastebin.
[09:20:02] <NoiseEee> andrew9183: also learn to use your console.  you'd clearly see something like "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Changes-to-Indian-Act-through-new-legislation-Harper-137968448.html. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." right in it.
[09:20:09] <cyberrog> pifantastic, http://pastebin.com/QZxtvgaS but the url is not relative path
[09:20:40] <pifantastic> cyberrog: then i'm not sure man, sorry
[09:20:50] <andrew9183> NoiseEee: thanks.  hmm i tried to do it with /index.html and it didnt work either :S
[09:20:59] <pifantastic> danols_work: yep, I was wrong, in certain cases inlines styles do not override stylesheet styles
[09:21:03] <cyberrog> pifantastic, =(
[09:21:05] <pifantastic> danols_work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/189621/when-does-csss-important-declaration-not-work
[09:21:16] <danols_work> thank you
[09:21:37] <danols_work> news to me too, anyway to force !important onto an animation ?
[09:21:42] <pifantastic> cyberrog: one approach would be to use $.getJSON more completely, attach a done(), fail() and always() callback
[09:21:50] <danols_work> maybe with a .setStyle()? (i'm mootools background)
[09:21:51] <io__> what are the possible easing "methods" ?
[09:21:57] <joelones> pifantastic, for now just getting a png
[09:22:10] <joelones> this is what I an doing:
[09:22:10] <joelones> $.ajax({type: 'POST', url: imageUrl, contentType: 'image/png', success: function (data) { var markup = "<img " + "src='" + "data:image/png," + data + "'/>"; $content.find( "#qrcodeSquare" ).html(markup); ...
[09:22:27] <joelones> i get a little square with a ? with the image should be
[09:22:44] <cyberrog> pifantastic, the name of the function parameter can be anyone, correct??
[09:23:16] <pifantastic> cyberrog: yes
[09:23:22] <janthony> Does anyone know how to get images to fade in IE so the transition looks smooth when using the jQuery cycle plugin?
[09:23:42] <cyberrog> pifantastic, I just don get it.. the function(data) is not reached. the log inside it is not printed
[09:23:51] <pifantastic> cyberrog: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/nFYWx/3/
[09:24:07] <pifantastic> cyberrog: try attaching a fail callback
[09:24:21] <pifantastic> cyberrog: which you should _always_ do anyways
[09:24:32] <cyberrog> pifantastic, gonna try..
[09:24:41] <danols_work> is it for real jquery has no abilty to add important natively ? http://ak.net84.net/javascript/adding-css-rules-with-important-using-jquery/
[09:25:48] <NoiseEee> danols_work: you most certainly can rewrite/re-define css rules with JS, but in most cases, its the wrong/long approach
[09:26:02] <cyberrog> pifantastic, if I dont pass any arguments in the function(), by calling console.log(arguments) it should print the returnment anyways????
[09:26:15] <danols_work> k
[09:26:19] <danols_work> NoiseEee: thansk
[09:26:45] <danols_work> so is that a yes ? or no? and if so how ? (I'm trying .css(...) funciton)
[09:27:23] <NoiseEee> danols_work: what are you trying to do? override an inline style?
[09:27:35] <pifantastic> cyberrog: yes
[09:30:20] <danols_work> nm
[09:30:35] <joelones> pifantastic, don't suppose you noticed anything wrong with the previous snippet?
[09:30:38] <danols_work> thanks all
[09:31:02] <danols_work> fyi this just dosen't work in jqery $(".change-list .filtered .results, .change-list .filtered .paginator, .filtered #toolbar, .filtered div.xfull").css('margin-right', '20% !important');
[09:31:32] <cyberrog> pifantastic, it falls into fail and later into always
[09:31:33] <pifantastic> joelones: nothing wrong, however I've never tried to get a PNG with $.ajax
[09:31:43] <pifantastic> cyberrog: and what is the error in fail?
[09:31:49] <pifantastic> it should print it to the console
[09:31:50] <NoiseEee> danols_work: why would you write !important in inline css?
[09:31:55] <pifantastic> cyberrog: are you sure your JSON is valid?
[09:31:56] <joelones> pifantastic, thanks for your help
[09:32:00] <pifantastic> http://jsonlint.com
[09:32:05] <danols_work> NoiseEee: scroll back
[09:32:12] <cyberrog> yes. Ive used it in other situations
[09:32:16] <pifantastic> joelones: you are assuming that it returns base64, but it probably returns binary or something
[09:32:25] <pifantastic> cyberrog: that doesn't count
[09:32:28] <NoiseEee> danols_work: bbbbut that's not where !important rules go
[09:32:33] <danols_work> inline elements style is being overdien by an !important in previous css styes I have no control over
[09:32:42] <pifantastic> cyberrog: lint your json to be sure
[09:32:45] <danols_work> only way to make it work by testing in firebug is to add !important
[09:32:53] <pifantastic> cyberrog: also, is your server setting the json header?
[09:32:55] <joelones> pifantastic, binary really? maybe the response is a page and not simply the png?
[09:33:00] <danols_work> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/189621/when-does-csss-important-declaration-not-work
[09:33:10] <danols_work> jquery lacking !important support is rather sad
[09:33:12] <NoiseEee> danols_work: oh i see, or writing a more specific css rule and giving that element the other rule
[09:33:17] <pifantastic> joelones: log the response and take a loog
[09:33:24] <cyberrog> pifantastic, yeah.. ['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
[09:33:27] <danols_work> yeah it's driving me nut - i'm giving up
[09:33:29] <danols_work> :)
[09:33:31] <danols_work> it's ok thanks guys
[09:33:44] <joelones> should have that will weinre, let me see
[09:33:47] <pifantastic> cyberrog: did you lint your json?
[09:34:29] <cyberrog> pifantastic, valid json
[09:34:40] <joelones> the response headers
[09:34:41] <joelones> Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
[09:34:58] <cyberrog> the json is valid
[09:35:06] <joelones> "Content-Type:image/png"
[09:35:37] <joelones> odd that the data URI would not work then
[09:35:50] <pifantastic> cyberrog: the arguments passed to the fail() callback are "jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown"
[09:35:57] <pifantastic> do those help narrow down the error?
[09:36:31] <cyberrog> pifantastic, the error message is message: "jQuery17108894642230588943_1327426231148 was not called"
[09:36:35] <pifantastic> joelones: what browser are you using?
[09:36:50] <pifantastic> cyberrog: ahhhh
[09:37:00] <pifantastic> cyberrog: for JSONP to work
[09:37:05] <omfgitsasalmon> hi, can anyone help me? I have a code -> http://pastebin.com/nFuux6Ek is there anyway for me to pass variable from the target ajax php over to this code?
[09:37:07] <pifantastic> your server has to wrap the JSON in a function call
[09:37:16] <pifantastic> so jquery sends a value as callback
[09:37:24] <pifantastic> and your server needs to wrap the response in that function
[09:37:33] <raj> is it possible with the jquery-ui autocomplete script, that once the word matches, to close the results box?
[09:37:43] <cyberrog> pifantastic, so instead of wrapping in a normal json, I have to wrap in JSONP??
[09:37:49] <raj> it currently remains open if the word typed matches the word in the box
[09:37:57] <pifantastic> cyberrog: it's the difference between this: http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=jquery
[09:37:58] <pifantastic> and this: http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=jquery&callback=test
[09:38:23] <pifantastic> you see how the second one is wrapped in a function with the same name as the callback parameter?
[09:38:24] <cyberrog> pifantastic, I dont get it..
[09:38:35] <pifantastic> cyberrog: you need to spend some time reading up on JSONP
[09:38:44] <pifantastic> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[09:38:56] <cyberrog> pifantastic, I have to create a function with the name of the calback??
[09:39:03] <omfgitsasalmon> erm, can anyone help me?
[09:39:11] <joelones> pifantastic, if I run the code in firefox and not on the iOS simulator, I get "405 Method Not Allowed"
[09:39:47] <pifantastic> omfgitsasalmon: you don't understand asychronicity
[09:39:49] <pifantastic> ?ftj
[09:39:49] <bot-t1> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[09:40:10] <pifantastic> omfgitsasalmon: read these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide33
[09:40:17] <omfgitsasalmon> pifantastic: no no, I want to know how to pass data from A to B. Through Ajax.
[09:40:19] <omfgitsasalmon> okay..
[09:41:54] <joelones> really weired why weinre and firefox would show me too different response statuses
[09:42:35] <cyberrog> pifantastic, so. I still have some doubts
[09:43:30] <datadl> hi
[09:43:45] <omfgitsasalmon> pifantastic: Hi, I debugged, the request was made by javascript, and it did register and show the contents.
[09:44:04] <uchuff> hi all
[09:44:15] <datadl> how is it possible to test if an event has already been fired before handling it ?
[09:44:26] <uchuff> is anyone able to help me getting beforeShow working on JQuery UI Datepicker, here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/bEgRu/1/
[09:44:27] <omfgitsasalmon> pifantastic: with the following: {status:Pass, error:2pm]
[09:44:29] <cyberrog> pifantastic, I have to create a function in server, and pass the name of this function to the callback parameter??
[09:44:35] <uchuff> beforeShow never seems to be called
[09:44:45] <uchuff> I'm probably doing something stupid, but i've been staring at it and can't see
[09:47:00] <joelones> pifantastic, this is what I see after I attempt to retreive and display the png in weinre:
[09:47:01] <joelones> http://i.imgur.com/OQnLF.png
[09:48:17] <techouse> what kind of information will .css('backgroundColor') give me to work with? hex, rgb or rgba?
[09:49:01] <uchuff> hmm, looks like beforeShow isn't enabled for inline datepickers
[09:49:03] <uchuff> interesting
[09:51:34] <omfgitsasalmon> anyone left around to help me?
[09:52:59] <devmikey> omfgitsasalmon: no
[09:53:10] <omfgitsasalmon> =/
[09:53:16] <omfgitsasalmon> seriously? I mean...
[09:53:19] <omfgitsasalmon> I really need help here...
[09:53:28] <uchuff> what's your problem omfgitsasalmon?
[09:53:39] <uchuff> nvm, i see your pastebin
[09:53:44] <omfgitsasalmon> uchuff: I want to pass data in json format from a.php
[09:53:46] <omfgitsasalmon> yeah
[09:54:02] <omfgitsasalmon> I debugged, the network was fine
[09:54:11] <omfgitsasalmon> the call to testwizard.php is right
[09:54:16] <omfgitsasalmon> testsetup*
[09:54:20] <omfgitsasalmon> .php is fine
[09:54:27] <omfgitsasalmon> I can see the result from the network tab in chrome
[09:54:44] <IvanKuzev> omfgitsasalmon:i was able to do it with json_encode($var) inthe php and then $.parseJSON in the jquery
[09:55:30] <Gorkyman> I'm looking for some jquery live table editing... or some best practices about that... any recommendation?
[09:55:39] <Gorkyman> basically something like add/edit/remove on a table rows
[09:56:29] <omfgitsasalmon> IvanKuzev: IvanKuzev Sorry I'm very new to jQuery, so I saw the doc for parseJSON, it requires the JSON result. I have that JSON result on a page, but that's after passing the variable. What I want to do is if data successfully insert into database, return success, else, return error and the error from mysql.
[09:57:13] <cyberrog> pifantastic, u there??
[09:59:27] <IvanKuzev> omfgitsasalmon: did you look at $.get or $.post methods? they have a callback function with data parameter.
[10:00:33] <IvanKuzev> that data is what you echo from the php.....if you echo  the json_encode($var) you get a json result ...otherwise it can be anything
[10:04:39] <omfgitsasalmon> IvanKuzev: I read the docs, the post is done in the form, so I want to use Ajax to grab the result of running the the sql in php from the script. The response differs from the result. I read the docs for .get thats why I uses json encrypt, following the example.
[10:05:26] <pifantastic> cyberrog: yeah
[10:05:48] <IvanKuzev> <omfgitsasalmon> : sorry you got me confused
[10:06:19] <IvanKuzev> i am pretty sure i have done simalar work curently but cant understand exactly what you want
[10:09:54] <IvanKuzev> <omfgitsasalmon> you have to use $.post('script.php',{param1:something,param2:something},function(data){});..to get the result...and then you can do a check if data is 'error' do error stuff else ..$.parseJSON
[10:11:29] <omfgitsasalmon> IvanKuzev: no no, I don't want to post things through jQuery, the post is through a form in html. I just want to get the result of the page from the php.
[10:11:31] <cyberrog> pifantastic, I wrapped the json with a function named my_function, and in the url I passed callback=my_function and this error came up is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[10:11:56] <omfgitsasalmon> IvanKuzev: Would it be better if I pastebin all the required files?
[10:12:11] <pifantastic> cyberrog: you should let jQuery actually name the callback
[10:12:17] <pifantastic> that's what 'callback=?' does
[10:12:25] <pifantastic> it tells jquery to insert a callback
[10:12:36] <cyberrog> and in server I name with which name??
[10:12:46] <pifantastic> use the value of the callback GET param
[10:12:59] <IvanKuzev>  <omfgitsasalmon> : i dont see how can you get something from the server if it isnt in the script you are curently runing
[10:13:02] <cyberrog> ohh got it..
[10:14:42] <cyberrog> pifantastic, is it safe to getjson in this way?? I mean, the url will be provided in the javascript code. anyone that see the sources will know it..
[10:15:28] <pifantastic> cyberrog: what do you mean? This is javascript bro, the whole world can read the source.
[10:15:35] <cyberrog> pifantastic, LOL
[10:15:36] <omfgitsasalmon> IvanKuzev: http://pastebin.com/yk4heHiK
[10:15:47] <pifantastic> If you're passing sensitive data, JSONP is probably not the solution
[10:15:47] <cyberrog> pifantastic, I got success. it returned success. Thanks a lot for ur help!!
[10:15:51] <pifantastic> np
[10:16:41] <omfgitsasalmon> IvanKuzev: the html form action is to a php script, which return something depending on the result of the database insert.
[10:16:56] <cyberrog> pifantastic, is there another aproach to retrieve sensitive data from via cross domain?
[10:17:55] <pifantastic> cyberrog: that's a rather advanced conversation
[10:18:24] <cyberrog> pifantastic, LOL why??
[10:19:00] <pifantastic> cyberrog: you'll need something like OAuth2
[10:19:08] <cyberrog> hmmm
[10:19:11] <pifantastic> which is too much for me to explain to you in an IRC chat
[10:19:17] <cyberrog> got it
[10:19:34] <cyberrog> pifantastic, do u have twitter??
[10:19:50] <pifantastic> @AaronForsander
[10:20:26] <cyberrog> pifantastic, or I can encapsulate this url in some way and pass it encapsulated to Javascript
[10:20:44] <pifantastic> I don't know what you mean by that
[10:26:02] <IvanKuzev> <omfgitsasalmon> : ok here is what i think you need to do..(not sure if its correnct) ....in the wl_form...in the on success calback...add a data parameter....and then in the php echo the json after you do your database work
[10:27:11] <IvanKuzev> <omfgitsasalmon> : then you can parse that data in the on success with $.parseJSON and get what you want(hopefuly)
[10:28:04] <pifantastic> If your server can serve jjson, you don't need to parse it, jquery will do that automatically with $.getJSON
[10:28:43] <kampsun> If I have a form with two submit inputs. How to I know which one was used for submiting in $('form').submit()
[10:29:32] <kampsun> event.target?
[10:31:27] <IvanKuzev> <pifantastic> he gets it as a return data from a multiuse form plugin....not sure if it will
[10:33:15] <IvanKuzev> <kampsun> check the php?maybe
[10:34:24] <oojacoboo> hey guys, if I'm parsing some json with strange characters, how can I encode or filter/process them without causing the js to fail?
[10:34:28] <IvanKuzev> <kampsun> it will probably be the first  or last one......??or all at once(dont listen to me)
[10:34:34] <wathek> Hi everybody
[10:34:44] <chrisinajar> oojacoboo: use valid json (seriously)
[10:34:56] <oojacoboo> chrisinajar: valid json?
[10:35:10] <chrisinajar> if your json is causing js to fail, fix the json, not the js
[10:35:22] <wathek> is it possible with jQueryUi autocomplete to force the user to selection one of the suggestions ?
[10:35:27] <IvanKuzev>  oojacoboo: well php automaticaly converts them to some code
[10:35:53] <oojacoboo> IvanKuzev: yes, like 50Ã¢â‚¬â„¢
[10:36:04] <oojacoboo> but I think that's the issue, being that the js isn't liking that at all
[10:36:54] <kampsun> Hmm okay, event.target is the form that was submited, not the input used for submiting
[10:37:10] <chrisinajar> kampsun: search around on that event object some more
[10:37:35] <kampsun> chrisinajar: Yeah, that's what I'm doing :)
[10:37:42] <IvanKuzev> <oojacoboo> : well json_encode in php worked with cirilyc ,,,whats so strange about your characters
[10:38:06] <Tomasso> how do I find a table inside an iframe from the outer page ? is that possible?
[10:38:14] <oojacoboo> IvanKuzev: not sure, it might be an encoding issue
[10:38:29] <oojacoboo> aka, not being added to that field, I'm checking, thought it was
[10:40:05] <IvanKuzev> <Tomasso> : i dont think so...i think it opens it as another tab(or something similar)
[10:40:08] <jarr0dsz> hi all!
[10:40:16] <jarr0dsz> anyone seen www.foursquare.com lately?
[10:40:18] <Tomasso> yup.. :S
[10:40:23] <jarr0dsz> they have very slick animations and fadeouts there
[10:40:37] <jarr0dsz> i would like to make something like that myself anyone could recommend what techniques to use?
[10:40:48] <kampsun> of course I could just attach onclick listeners to both of my submit buttons
[10:41:39] <IvanKuzev> you can even add one to both and diferentiate by event current target
[10:42:52] <kampsun> Indeed, after all, I don't even need the .submit on my <form>. What was i thinking
[10:49:20] <Jester831> Howdy, is it possible to do an on binding with http://www.appelsiini.net/download/jquery.jeditable.js?
[10:53:51] <muhoo> jarr0dsz: css3 transistions?
[10:54:03] <jarr0dsz> muhoo: you think its css 3 yes?
[10:54:21] <muhoo> just a wild guess. look at the code and see
[10:54:22] <jarr0dsz> muhoo: hmm i should try the site on an older browser see how it works there, shame im up2date and have no old browsers around l;p
[10:54:35] <muhoo> jarr0dsz: vm's are great :-)
[10:54:44] <jarr0dsz> muhoo: the code is a bit messy ;p havent dived into it yet but its all combined and compressed thats a hard guess
[10:55:10] <muhoo> look at the css. if you see -webkit-transition or such, it's using css3
[10:55:30] <muhoo> most js is messy
[10:55:47] <muhoo> most css is messy too, come to think of it. so is most html :-)
[10:56:46] <Jester831> if someone declares a function like $.fn.foo = functionâ€¦, what's the syntax for binding that to on?
[10:57:33] <Jester831> like $(document).on('click', 'span.bar', foo(â€¦ or?
[10:57:57] <oojacoboo> sure
[10:58:08] <Jester831> that didn't work ;p
[10:58:25] <jedimind> can you guys anticipate why i would have trouble selectin complex ids ?
[10:58:31] <IvanKuzev>   $.fn.foo  = $(element).foo
[10:58:32] <jedimind> $('#project-?projects=untourist')
[10:58:34] <jedimind> for example fucks up
[10:58:55] <oojacoboo> jedimind: example
[10:58:59] <oojacoboo> mm
[10:59:01] <jedimind> that
[10:59:02] <jedimind> :)
[10:59:06] <Eviltwin> jedimind: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[10:59:10] <Eviltwin> Look at what needs to be escaped
[10:59:19] <Eviltwin> Right at the top there
[10:59:21] <Jester831> ivankizev: http://www.appelsiini.net/download/jquery.jeditable.js
[10:59:30] <Jester831> ivankuzev**
[10:59:35] <red_square> what is generating that ugly thing jedimind
[10:59:57] <oojacoboo> jedimind: why use your url encoded params as an id?
[11:00:36] <oojacoboo> why notâ€¦ #project-untourist and then .replace("project-", "");
[11:01:03] <oojacoboo> and form the url base in a var and pass that to your post or whatever
[11:01:30] <jedimind> im just going to build a new naming convention for these things
[11:01:41] <jedimind> instead of tryin to bootstrap the url as the ID
[11:01:45] <oojacoboo> that's what I was saying yo :P
[11:02:04] <jedimind> i know
[11:02:23] <IvanKuzev>  <Jester831>  what do you want to do with taht?
[11:02:29] <IvanKuzev> *that?
[11:02:57] <ravenzz> jedimind what about data ?
[11:03:07] <Jester831> I want to add a row to a table that uses jquery.editable without rebinding
[11:03:42] <Jester831> http://pastebin.com/jLCzrzRA
[11:04:02] <jedimind> ravenzz, what about data?
[11:04:16] <oojacoboo> Jester831: use delegation then
[11:04:38] <oojacoboo> jquery ui lists the event to use for editable
[11:04:38] <jedimind> im just going to end up using the slug instead i guess that makes more sense
[11:04:48] <sven_oostenbrink> I have in example HTML <div class='a'></div><div class='a'></div><div class='a'><div class='b'><div class='c'><div class='d'></div><div class='d'></div></div></div></div>, I know how to select the last 'a', but I need to append another <div class='d'></div> in the <div class='c'> that resides in the last class=a... How do I select that ?
[11:04:55] <Jester831> what would the syntax be ?
[11:04:59] <Jester831> jQuery('.invoice-breakdown span.query-items').editable(
[11:05:15] <ravenzz> jedimind <div id="cool" data-crap="project-?projects=untourist"></div>
[11:05:26] <ravenzz> so you can still have a valid ID
[11:05:32] <jedimind> well id like to retain IDs because of the inherent usability
[11:05:42] <ravenzz> uhm
[11:05:43] <jedimind> and they're generated automagically (the content peices)
[11:05:56] <jedimind> i dont need the actual project-?shit string at all for anything
[11:05:58] <ravenzz> but you can have invalid IDs
[11:06:01] <jedimind> i just need a unique identifier
[11:06:03] <jedimind> i know, thats why im changing it
[11:06:16] <jedimind> so that my IDs will no longer look like that
[11:06:21] <ravenzz> k
[11:07:36] <ravenzz> btw I don't know what are you trying to do, perhaps there is another valid and cool way to do that
[11:08:17] <ravenzz> eg hash the url and use it as ID
[11:09:36] <jeffreylevesque> is this valid: for (var tIncrement = 1; tIncrement <= total; tIncrement++ ) {  $('#thumb-container .thumb-' + tIncrement + ' a').click( function() }
[11:09:54] <jedimind> im rendering all the pages from wordpress on a single page
[11:10:06] <jedimind> and i was using the url variable as an ID for each of the blocks so that i can have my behaviour associated with them
[11:10:18] <jedimind> but instead im going to use the slug variable instead, which will not have any special characters
[11:10:26] <ravenzz> use the postid
[11:11:30] <jeffreylevesque> if total = 4; wll there be 4 click() events: is this valid: for (var tIncrement = 1; tIncrement <= total; tIncrement++ ) { $('#thumb-container .thumb-' + tIncrement + ' a').click( function() }?
[11:12:25] <sean`> jeffreylevesque, you will create 1 click event for four elements
[11:12:29] <ravenzz> jedimind it will work anyway eg. http://smashingmagazine.com/?p=123332
[11:12:32] <sean`> not 4 click events per element
[11:12:46] <jeffreylevesque> will the events be unique per element?
[11:12:58] <sean`> yes
[11:13:05] <jeffreylevesque> sean`: currently each element has the same click event
[11:13:08] <sean`> jeffreylevesque, there's a smarter way though
[11:13:44] <jeffreylevesque> whats the smarter way?
[11:13:50] <sean`> $('#thumb-container .thumb').filter (function (i) { return i < tIncrement; }).click (function () { ..  });
[11:13:59] <sean`> lol
[11:14:04] <sean`> and
[11:14:36] <sean`> $('#thumb-container .thumb:lt(' + tIncrement + ')').click (function () { .. }); is also a solution
[11:14:50] <sean`> assuming your html structure allowes you to do this
[11:15:13] <sean`> this way you do only one selector, instead of every time and you create one anonymous function instead of 4
[11:16:36] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[11:17:12] <jeffreylevesque> any chance I can get you to take a look at my js code
[11:20:14] <jeffreylevesque> im still trying to build this rotator: http://jsfiddle.net/YpW3a/26/.  the thumbnails defined in thumbnail() doesn't update the main rotator
[11:31:08] <josh9> i use jquerymobile and backbone. i have a ul that is injected to the DOM. since it's not part of the original page, i need to use .trigger('create')
[11:31:42] <josh9> on my ul. i do that from a click event of a button and it's ok. but i try to do that when the page finished loading - $('[data-role=page]').live('pageinit', function () {
[11:31:51] <josh9> and it's not doing anything. any ideas?
[11:32:46] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live, ever
[11:32:52] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[11:33:00] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on if you need that feature
[11:33:11] <red_square> even on mobile?
[11:33:55] <red_square> thought live was ok on mob
[11:34:10] <Eviltwin> .live is always bad
[11:36:30] <red_square> everything I have seen uses live for page events
[11:36:40] <jeffreylevesque> anyone free to scope out a rotator.js code?
[11:38:49] <jeffreylevesque> is this code incorrect? where total = 4?
[11:38:50] <jeffreylevesque> http://pastebin.com/VMmvNFfK
[11:42:09] <josh9> Eviltwin: thanks. i switched to on. but the li of my listview don't have the added classes that jquery mobile adds. so $('.products').listview().trigger('create');
[11:42:14] <josh9> did nothing.
[11:42:33] <josh9> it works from my button click event..
[11:43:03] <cybersholt> anybody here know a good WYSIWYG editor plugin i was using cleditor but it's being mean to a php file users need to edit
[11:44:59] <NoiseEee> users editing a php file, sounds good
[11:45:07] <NoiseEee> sorry just being snarky
[11:45:56] <Eviltwin> mysql_query("DROP DATABASE mysql");
[11:46:20] <cybersholt> eh i hear ya
[11:47:46] <cybersholt> im parsing the doc input for bad strings tho
[11:48:06] <Jbom> someone can help me with ajax and jquery?
[11:48:30] <red_square> ? ask @ Jbom
[11:48:31] <bot-t1> Jbom, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:51:51] <Jbom> see this http://pastebin.com/uEEvZEpK
[11:52:42] <Jbom> console.log(data.result); console log show error
[11:53:06] <Jbom> how return value php to javascript??
[11:54:34] <joikus> you guys
[11:54:50] <joikus> how can I hover over an element, and fire off a $.post only if I'm hovered for > 2 seconds
[11:54:55] <joikus> any tricks?
[11:58:31] <NoiseEee> you'll want to use a setTimeout that you can cancel if you hover off the element
[11:58:36] <NoiseEee> beyond that, theres enough hints to get you going!
[11:59:20] <gf3> joikus: check out the hoverintent plugin
[11:59:33] <gf3> NoiseEee: there's always a plugin for thatâ„¢
[11:59:39] <NoiseEee> so i am learning
[11:59:47] <PKKid2> I have a table with about 8000 items in it (in HTML).  My problem is rendering the HTML takes about 2 or 3 seconds.  Is there a way I can tell my page to only render about 500 lines at a time (until they scroll or something)?
[12:00:18] <gf3> PKKid2: yes
[12:01:09] <PKKid2> gf3, LOL -- Any more information? Perhaps a javascript packages that might have done the heavy lifting already you can think of/
[12:01:22] <gf3> PKKid2: well first things first
[12:01:50] <gf3> PKKid2: IDGAF what kind of information you are presenting, 8000 rows is too many
[12:02:04] <drummer306> you could always paginate the results
[12:02:05] <gf3> no one can parse that much information
[12:02:24] <gf3> PKKid2: so before spending a lot of time trying to solve this issue
[12:02:34] <gf3> PKKid2: it might be better to approach it from a different angle
[12:02:53] <PKKid2> its an admin page that shows items in a queue to be processed.
[12:03:00] <gf3> yes
[12:03:03] <gf3> regardless
[12:03:11] <gf3> 8000 == too_many
[12:03:13] <PKKid2> so, we don't ingest all of it, but often lookup to see if something is there.
[12:03:18] <gf3> BUT IT'S YOUR CALL BRO
[12:03:28] <PKKid2> we just use ctrl+f to see if an item is there
[12:03:32] <drummer306> does it auto refresh or something ?
[12:03:39] <PKKid2> no
[12:03:41] <gf3> PKKid2: maybe a search function?
[12:03:46] <drummer306> ajax search !
[12:03:46] <PKKid2> f5 reloads it
[12:04:16] <PKKid2> yea, all available solutions seem to take more effort than the result is worth
[12:04:24] <cybersholt> NoiseEee: thinking about my user editable template i should probly switch to something like this > http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/parser.html
[12:04:37] <PKKid2> I might just punt on it for now, if something easy is around it would be worth it
[12:04:39] <PKKid2> thanks guys
[12:06:18] <NoiseEee> cybersholt: the whole idea makes me queasy, but you might want to check out http://codeangel.org/articles/simple-php-template-engine.html instead, and ##php for php things.
[12:06:42] <joikus> what if I
[12:07:17] <joikus> $('#tooltipPE').bind('hover', function (e) { $.post(..., function(){ $('#tooltipPE').unbind();  }););
[12:07:29] <cybersholt> yeah me 2 what im allowing them to edit is a template for invoices and im already in Codeigniter
[12:07:29] <joikus> can I unbind on the ajax's callback?
[12:08:16] <drummer306> joikus, you could but your post would fire right away
[12:09:37] <cybersholt> this is one of those situations where u're damned if u do and if u don't
[12:10:24] <Kzim> hi i'm looking for a way to input that like textarea but with more possibility. but i still want something simple like a ultra-simple wysiwyg
[12:10:26] <joikus> i dont mind if it fires right away
[12:10:31] <joikus> as long is only fires once yo know?
[12:10:43] <cybersholt> Kzim check out cleditor
[12:11:34] <cybersholt> @ http://premiumsoftware.net/cleditor/
[12:13:11] <Kzim> cybersholt: i go check that thx. do you know how WYSISYG work ? i mean we can edit bold text without being in a textarea how is that possible ?
[12:13:42] <drummer306> joikus that should work , try it
[12:13:51] <cybersholt> u should be able to do what ya need with that Kzim
[12:14:41] <drummer306> I like TinyMCE as well, although i was having an issue with their jquery plugin
[12:15:04] <Kzim> cybersholt: i want for exemple have a little 2 like editor and been able to highlight words of click/popup on the words. well change content of those with jquery
[12:15:30] <NoiseEee> joikus: http://api.jquery.com/one/
[12:15:52] <cybersholt> oh idk then man sorry
[12:19:14] <Kzim> cybersholt: i'll check cleditor it look nice
[12:19:32] <cybersholt> yea its all right there are a ton of them out there
[12:23:29] <ngharo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5TLk4-rcY#!
[12:23:35] <ngharo> javascript: WAT
[12:30:21] <techouse> any way to animate line-height?
[12:31:05] <stalecache> How do I check to see if $("#my-link") has a "live" click event attached to it?
[12:32:12] <techouse> what do you mean by live?
[12:32:13] <Eviltwin> Why?
[12:32:19] <techouse> that it has an event bound to it?
[12:32:31] <dabear_> stalecache: live events are always attached to the document
[12:33:15] <stalecache> techhouse, somewhere in the code I have $(".blue-link").live("click", function(e){ }); ... where "#my-link" has the class "blue-link"
[12:33:39] <Eviltwin> First, don't use .live
[12:33:42] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[12:34:39] <techouse> yea
[12:34:42] <techouse> use .binf
[12:34:44] <techouse> .bind
[12:34:47] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[12:34:50] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on
[12:34:55] <techouse> or that
[12:34:58] <Eviltwin> If you still want to do what .live does
[12:35:03] <Eviltwin> But the right way
[12:35:31] <stalecache> Eviltwin, is someLink.delegate("body", "click", function(e){}) the same as someLink.live("click", function(e){}); ?
[12:36:18] <Eviltwin> $("foo").live("click", function() { ... }) effectively calls $(document).delegate("foo", "click", function() { ... })
[12:37:16] <stalecache> Eviltwin, oh right, got it mixed up... makes sense thanks
[12:41:15] <AaronCampbell> I'm trying to get elements with the name 'first_name' that are NOT in the element with the id "mq-registration".  This seems to include things in #mq-registration: jQuery(":not(#mq-registration) [name=last_name]")
[12:42:06] <AaronCampbell> Sorry, I obviously have to do both first_name and last_name...the question and example weren't the same, but once I get one to work I'll be fine I'm sure.
[12:45:48] <AaronCampbell> Nevermind, I need to give it the type of element that #mq-registration is, so this works: jQuery("div:not(#mq-registration) [name=last_name]")
[12:47:39] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/qLqaK/
[12:47:59] <Eviltwin> The problem is that :not(#mq-registration) includes things like <body>
[12:48:10] <Eviltwin> And of course all of the inputs are children of the body
[12:51:20] <AaronCampbell> Eviltwin: thanks for the explanation.  I hadn't thought of it that way.  I appreciate it
[12:52:50] <Eviltwin> Yeah, took me a bit to realize why it didn't work
[12:56:43] <aarobc_work> Hi! So I was looking at the documentation here http://api.jquery.com/submit/ and I'm trying to do a form validation for a specific form. is that possible? how would you specify what form you're wanting to check?
[12:56:49] <andrew9183> hey evil
[12:56:53] <andrew9183> can i ask a question? :P
[12:57:30] <andrew9183> jsfiddle.net/EkU7G/4/
[12:57:33] <andrew9183> how come my load isn't working ?
[12:57:57] <eddiemonge> aarobc_work: by binding to that forms submit event
[12:58:06] <LazyTown> If I have jquery ui tabs loading content via ajax and I want to run some functions on the loaded content,  which event to do I listen to?
[12:58:14] <LazyTown> right now I'm not getting thew desired effect
[12:59:08] <NoiseEee> andrew9183: no need for .each at all
[12:59:29] <aarobc_work> eddiemonge: is there a way I can then have all the values that would normally be posted go into some sort of object, or do I just have to manually pass all of them in?
[12:59:57] <aarobc_work> to said function*
[13:00:42] <andrew9183> k thanks NoiseEee
[13:01:15] <EyePulp> if I have two selectors #foo and #bar, and one or the other is on the page, is there a sneaky-clean way to initialize a var to the one that exists without a lot of if then's ?
[13:01:38] <eddiemonge> ?serialize @ aarobc_work
[13:01:39] <bot-t1> aarobc_work, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[13:01:41] <Jester831> how do you delegate an object function? I get the error that it isn't defined
[13:01:55] <LazyTown> If I have jquery ui tabs loading content via ajax and I want to run some functions on the loaded content,  which event to do I listen to?
[13:02:06] <jstout24> how can i make a jquery method call dynamic? ie: var m = 'append'; $em.m('foo'); would append foo to $em
[13:02:07] <aarobc_work> eddiemonge: oh nice, much thanks.
[13:02:19] <LiroXIV> Okay, question; I'm building a sort of digital signage system with jQuery and HTML5 video. I need a date/time readout that updates live
[13:02:31] <NoiseEee> jstout24: why oh why?
[13:02:58] <jstout24> I'm developing a toolbar and want to give more flexibility
[13:03:16] <jstout24> i can easliy do a switch statement i guess to allow for certain ones.. but i'm just wondering =)
[13:03:58] <eddiemonge> ?ajax.load
[13:03:59] <bot-t1> eddiemonge, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:04:28] <eddiemonge> jstout24: why do you need to do that?
[13:05:02] <andrew9183> do I have to manually load the content with $.load
[13:05:06] <andrew9183> or does it inject the html automatically
[13:05:15] <jstout24> an internal business application.. a toolbar that does injection for our employees
[13:05:49] <eddiemonge> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/EkU7G/6/
[13:06:19] <eddiemonge> jstout24: thats not what im asking. why do you think you need to make jquery methods dynamically called?
[13:06:49] <DofLeFou> Anyone knows of a good plugin for doing some flip animation
[13:06:50] <andrew9183> eddiemonge:  hmmm i wonder why that works and not the data method
[13:06:50] <jstout24> eddiemonge: i'm pulling a json feed that has defined domains and selectors then embedding html into the dom where the selector is
[13:06:57] <eddiemonge> andrew9183: oops try this instead http://jsfiddle.net/EkU7G/7/
[13:07:00] <andrew9183> the data method was suggested by rmurphey :P
[13:07:08] <jstout24> eddiemonge: i'd like to be able to define append, prepend, after, before, etc.
[13:07:15] <eddiemonge> andrew9183: i have no idea what why you needed that "data" method
[13:07:31] <eddiemonge> jstout24: why?
[13:07:37] <jstout24> omg, nevermind.
[13:07:38] <jstout24> hahahaha
[13:07:52] <jstout24> "why daddy"
[13:07:52] <rmurphey> andrew9183: it bears mentioning that the book you're reading is something like 2 years old and was written for jquery 1.4
[13:07:57] <jstout24> "why is the sky blue daddy"
[13:08:02] <eddiemonge> 95% certain you are making it harder on yourself
[13:08:15] <jstout24> simple question.
[13:08:20] <Jester831> anyone up for taking a look at this? http://pastebin.com/rcYa7mM8
[13:08:22] <jstout24> wasn't going to do the logic until i needed it.
[13:08:27] <andrew9183> ohh, didn't know rmurphey, sorry
[13:08:28] <jstout24> if i needed it. just asked a simple question.
[13:08:30] <Jester831> I'm having troubles delegating ;(
[13:08:31] <jstout24> =)!!!
[13:08:52] <eddiemonge> jstout24: think its something like $('ele')[method}()
[13:09:03] <eddiemonge> but if you need that you are probably doing it wrong
[13:09:21] <eddiemonge> JesperA: what is editable?
[13:10:01] <eddiemonge> jQuery('.invoice-breakdown').delegate('span.query-items', 'click', editable);
[13:10:05] <eddiemonge> editable is the callback
[13:10:10] <Jester831> eddiemonge: http://www.appelsiini.net/download/jquery.jeditable.js
[13:10:38] <LazyTown> how can I call a function on a jquery ui tab that has just been loaded
[13:10:51] <jstout24> LazyTown: why?
[13:11:16] <LazyTown> because I load html via ajax and want to call a function which styles and binds events
[13:11:28] <LazyTown> to the content of that which was loaded via ajax
[13:12:32] <LazyTown> jstout24: Isn't that common?
[13:12:45] <andrew9183> it doesn't work on success ?
[13:12:54] <eddiemonge> LazyTown: bind to the the tabs load event
[13:13:00] <eddiemonge> LazyTown: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#event-load
[13:13:02] <andrew9183> that works too
[13:13:18] <eddiemonge> jstout24: dont be an ass. thats a common and valid use case
[13:13:18] <LazyTown> doesn't that run before this:  $(".tab").bind("tabsshow", function(event, ui){
[13:13:34] <jstout24> <3
[13:14:04] <LazyTown> I was under impression that the tabasshow runs after tabsload?
[13:14:09] <Jester831> eddiemonge: I suppose editable sets up bindings itself
[13:14:59] <Jester831> is the workaround then to just edit jquery.jeditable to use on instead of bind
[13:15:12] <danzik17> LazyTown: it does - isn't that what youre gunning for?
[13:15:39] <Jester831> it doesn't really make sense to delegate a binding..
[13:15:40] <LazyTown> Yeah!  thats my point,  when I break in the code that tabsshow even runs before the content is loaded
[13:15:53] <eddiemonge> LazyTown: not sure but you want load
[13:16:11] <LazyTown> eddiemonge,  thank you.
[13:16:25] <eddiemonge> JesperA: dont edit it. if you do then you become responsible for maintaining your local copy
[13:16:29] <LazyTown> danzik17 thank you
[13:16:32] <LazyTown> jstout24 thank you
[13:16:47] <eddiemonge> JesperA: inline editing is so small, i would write your own custom plugin. that plugin seems....excessive
[13:17:15] <JesperA> wow, please stop highlighting me when Jester831 is the one you should highlight
[13:17:16] <JesperA> :P
[13:17:28] <andrew9183> lol
[13:17:46] <eddiemonge> sorry tab completion
[13:17:56] <eddiemonge> i dont always pay attention to who is talking
[13:18:11] <danzik17> LazyTown: you're correct.  if you're lazy loading the tab via ajax, tabsshow fires first ( confirmed on their demo page )
[13:18:33] <Jester831> I'm realizing that, however I'm curios as well if there's anyway to make binding object functions delegate instead of binding
[13:18:40] <Jester831> curious*
[13:23:16] <Eviltwin> Jester831: "anyway to make binding object functions delegate instead of binding"?
[13:23:19] <Eviltwin> What?
[13:24:56] <whoever> is there a better way to use <br> in a div rather then appending each line to the previous ?
[13:30:54] <eddiemonge> whoever: huh? you mean add line breaks?
[13:31:32] <whoever> eddiemonge: correcth
[13:31:38] <chrisinajar> whoever: wut?
[13:31:39] <whoever> *correct
[13:31:40] <someprimetime> that's how a line break works
[13:31:51] <eddiemonge> whoever: what/how are you building the content?
[13:32:02] <chrisinajar> inb4 he's in over his head
[13:33:55] <aarobc_work> I have a general javascript question. How do I access the contents of text boxes and listboxes? I see document.getElementById() but that doesn't seem to work for me at all.
[13:34:01] <whoever> (<div/>,{text:"text "<br> "mor text"}).appendTo("#id");
[13:34:21] <someprimetime> what the heck is that
[13:34:27] <whoever> eddiemonge: i forgot to add te $ to the opening paren
[13:35:00] <aarobc_work> And all the tutorials I'm finding online aren't working
[13:35:07] <aarobc_work> or they make no sense. :-p
[13:36:30] <laurenty> does anyone know if there's a way to get jqueryui draggable and selectable to work together?
[13:38:03] <Compeeler> hi
[13:38:25] <laurenty> hi
[13:38:26] <Compeeler> does anyone know how to use collision checking/ hittest  in jquery
[13:38:52] <eddiemonge> aarobc_work: what do you think doc.getelebyid does?
[13:38:57] <laurenty> what do you mean?
[13:39:09] <Compeeler> like, if 2 divs collide
[13:39:17] <Compeeler> using animate()
[13:39:37] <eddiemonge> laurenty: they should work together with no problems
[13:39:50] <aarobc_work> eddiemonge: gets the contents of whatever input element has that name.
[13:39:53] <eddiemonge> Compeeler: you would need a plugin for that
[13:40:00] <Compeeler> oooh, what one
[13:40:00] <laurenty> eddiemonge: they don't...
[13:40:08] <eddiemonge> aarobc_work: nope. it grabs that element so you can do stuff to it
[13:40:27] <eddiemonge> aarobc_work: i would suggest picking up a beginner's guide to javascript
[13:40:48] <laurenty> eddiemonge: when enabling draggable, I lose the option to click on the element to select it
[13:40:55] <laurenty> eddiemonge: only the lasso works

[13:40:59] <bot-t1> laurenty, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[13:41:25] <aarobc_work> eddiemonge: I'm not a fan of walls of text, do you know something that's example heavy?
[13:41:35] <Compeeler> How would i be able to implement collision checking, in my example : http://jsfiddle.net/Rj3QY/
[13:42:12] <Compeeler> is there like an event like keypress,,,,,
[13:42:44] <eddiemonge> aarobc_work: you have got to learn the basics. if you dont know what/how document.getElementsById() is/does, you are in trouble
[13:43:02] <eddiemonge> Compeeler: look at the event passed in
[13:43:52] <Compeeler> kk
[13:43:58] <eddiemonge> console.log it even
[13:44:36] <Compeeler> i just googled, there doesnt seem to be an event called, "passed in"
[13:44:46] <eddiemonge> lol
[13:45:07] <eddiemonge> look at the event, that is passed in
[13:45:12] <Compeeler> ooooo
[13:45:25] <Compeeler> srry, i still dont get you
[13:47:07] <Compeeler> i am using the animate feature to move things, how do i check for the collision
[13:48:04] <eddiemonge> Compeeler: http://jsfiddle.net/Rj3QY/1/
[13:48:45] <Compeeler> coolness, im opening up
[13:48:58] <gamingdroid> What does the $(this).is(':visible') mean? Like, what does it check the ':visible' against?
[13:49:55] <eddiemonge> gamingdroid: it looks to see if display is not none, visibility is not hidden
[13:50:20] <gamingdroid> eddiemonge: how does it know to look for 'display'?
[13:50:42] <someprimetime> gamingdroid: it's built in to that pseudo selector
[13:50:57] <someprimetime> it checks for both cases
[13:51:11] <Compeeler> hey eddie, what does console.log do?  and how can i make an alert box come up while the buttons have collided
[13:53:02] <gamingdroid> someprimetime: are pseudo selector a css thing? it's not clear to me after googling.

[13:57:44] <someprimetime> Compeeler: the log is intended to store any output from your code

[13:58:14] <someprimetime> well, i shouldn't say "store"
[13:58:16] <Compeeler> ah cool
[13:58:18] <someprimetime> what i mean is "display"
[13:58:26] <jedimind_> what would be a logical way of checking if an element has a width defined in css ?
[13:58:35] <Compeeler> stdout
[13:58:39] <gamingdroid> someprimetime & eddiemonge: thanks!
[13:59:15] <someprimetime> if(!$('#foobar').width()) { alert('no width set'); } maybe?
[13:59:28] <eddiemonge> jedimind_: typeof domele.style.width !== undefined ?
[13:59:59] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: that gets the computed width
[13:59:59] <laurenty> eddiemonge: did you get a chance to try it?
[14:00:11] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: ah gotcha
[14:00:28] <jedimind_> style.width can also apply to width applied inline
[14:00:29] <Compeeler> so, i will have to make a function to check for collisions. And check everytime the object has moved? or is there a more efficient way
[14:00:34] <jedimind_> i want to check for specifically defined by css
[14:00:55] <jedimind_> im wondering why just $(el).css('width'); wouldnt work
[14:02:38] <DofLeFou> what is the deal w .fadeTo('slow', 0); .. it unbind all of my click event
[14:02:48] <NoiseEee> defined in css, meaning the original rule and not the computed style, jedimind_?
[14:03:02] <DofLeFou> when I retry to to do fadeTo('slow', 1.0);

[14:05:05] <_ramo> hi
[14:05:07] <Compeeler> repost: so, i will have to make a function to check for collisions. And check everytime the object has moved? or is there a more efficient way
[14:05:44] <_ramo> is it possible to append a <div> to a <ul> element? the ul is genereated dynamically, and i would like to append an <div> to it with a default link
[14:06:35] <laurenty> _ramo: <ul> accepts <li> as children
[14:06:39] <ravenzz> ^
[14:07:58] <_ramo> laurenty: yes, but is it possible to what i would like to have is a <ul><li></li>....<ul><div></div>   so that this div is always "glued" after <ul> (the ul can have a dynamic height)
[14:08:25] <NoiseEee> _ramo: you're missing the point
[14:08:39] <NoiseEee> _ramo: feel free to put a <div> in an <li> if you like
[14:08:44] <laurenty> _ramo: http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[14:09:03] <ravenzz> _ramo it is not valid
[14:09:05] <Compeeler> repost: so, i will have to make a function to check for collisions. And check everytime the object has moved? or is there a more efficient way
[14:09:34] <eddiemonge> Compeeler: as far as i know, thats how you do it
[14:09:35] <_ramo> so but how could i achieve to always have something glued on a dynamich height-sized ul ?
[14:10:11] <laurenty> _ramo: make it the last <li> of the <ul>
[14:10:11] <NoiseEee> _ramo: add <li>s instead of <ul>s ?
[14:10:51] <_ramo> laurenty: and how to do that? with a simple append?
[14:10:54] <ravenzz> _ramo "lists are made up of sequences of list items defined by the LI element (whose end tag may be omitted)"
[14:10:58] <ravenzz> _ramo append
[14:11:03] <ravenzz> a li
[14:11:09] <_ramo> hm, okay
[14:11:14] <_ramo> that what i've already have
[14:11:34] <_ramo> thank you
[14:11:48] <ravenzz> $('ul').append($('<li/>').text('foo'));
[14:12:15] <_ramo> ravenzz: exactly what i have
[14:13:23] <ravenzz> so what is the question?
[14:17:12] <_ramo> ravenzz: it's hard to explain... but let me paint a picture :)
[14:17:16] <_ramo> like this: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/546/painthj.jpg/
[14:18:00] <eddiemonge> why not insert the "Click Me" after the list then?
[14:19:20] <Jon47> I know i can use the .load method to bind a callback to an element's "load" event, but is there a way to tell if an element has already been loaded?
[14:19:57] <_ramo> eddiemonge: is that easily possible? wouldn't that be what ravenzz said?
[14:20:05] <Jon47> i'm finding that the browser doesn't send the "load" event for images that are already in the cache...
[14:20:12] <matsebc> gezz I am SO stupid sometimes
[14:20:33] <ravenzz> yeap sure
[14:21:30] <ravenzz> _ramo $('ul').after($('<a/>').attr('href','#foo').text('click me'));
[14:22:09] <eddiemonge> _ramo: slightly. but instead of adding at as a child of list, add it after
[14:22:18] <eddiemonge> so then you can use append in the ul
[14:26:49] <_ramo> ravenzz: that's not working for me. the "click me" is somewhere on my site and not "glued" to the ul
[14:27:05] <Compeeler> nice
[14:27:22] <ravenzz> that could depend on your css
[14:27:31] <_ramo> okay
[14:27:36] <_ramo> thanks
[14:29:33] <jedimind_> hrm, if i want to animate a number of things at once, but not stack them (ie wait for one to finish for another to start)
[14:29:38] <jedimind_> what would be the best way of doing that
[14:29:52] <jedimind_> right now, i have 4 animations just in a row that i want to trigger at the same time, but they seem to be going sequentially instead
[14:30:00] <laurenty> so no ideas on the jqueryui draggable + selectable issue???
[14:31:46] <Eviltwin> jedimind_: Example of what you're trying to do?
[14:32:02] <jedimind_> $(el).animate({width: something } ...
[14:32:02] <jedimind_> fuck
[14:32:11] <jedimind_> as im typing it i realized that i can just have multiple things in that same .animate call
[14:32:13] <Eviltwin> Yup
[14:32:16] <jedimind_> instead of doing .animate several times
[14:32:18] <Eviltwin> Yup
[14:32:24] <jedimind_> disregard, i suck cocks

[14:42:14] <_ramo> ravenzz: how can i bind an click event to the and alert a value of a field where somethin was inserted? i tried it like this http://jsfiddle.net/uuPGq/3/

[14:47:06] <dogarrhea2> i need to convert a json string into an actual json object
[14:47:09] <dogarrhea2> how do i do this?
[14:48:30] <silverwind> No such thing as a "json object"... If you probably want JSON.parse
[14:49:00] <theBrettman> what's the deal with the jquery color project?
[14:49:05] <silverwind> You will probably need a polyfill like json2.js for older browsers.
[14:52:59] <_ramo> how can i check if $(this).attr("value") is empty ?
[14:53:11] <dogarrhea2> {blah:"somestuff"} should be parsed right?
[14:55:00] <gf3> ?mdn hasAttribute @ _ramo

[14:55:26] <dogarrhea2> why is this?
[14:55:40] <_ramo> gf3: i check on focus if something is in the input field, say it has a value
[14:56:07] <gf3> _ramo: element.hasAttribute
[14:56:30] <theBrettman> no, hasAttribute will tell u if it exists
[14:56:36] <_ramo> hm, so you say i should remove the value attribute from the element ?
[14:56:43] <gf3> is that not what we want?
[14:57:03] <_ramo> gf3: i guess no, i just want to know if value="" or value="gf3"
[14:57:17] <gf3> I think you have your answer
[14:57:20] <Compeeler> yap
[14:57:35] <theBrettman> you could have value by itself without value="" and it would still return true
[14:57:44] <_ramo> just check : if($(this).attr("value") != "") ?
[14:59:21] <theBrettman> then do $(this[val='']) || $(this[value="gf3"])
[15:02:39] <Compeeler> yap
[15:03:39] <Krinkle> I heard something about jQuery build in slideDown/Up/Toggle in 1.7 no longer requiring stop(true,true) when used in hover()
[15:03:44] <Krinkle> however http://jsfiddle.net/GumE8/1/ doesn't seem to agree
[15:03:49] <Krinkle> is that an open bug ? I can't find it
[15:04:07] <Krinkle> would be nice to have it in core (if it doesn't brake anything)
[15:05:45] <jarr0dsz> hi all in friendly_id theres is in docs   friendly_id :name, use: :slugged
[15:05:48] <jarr0dsz> but that is invalid syntax
[15:06:06] <jarr0dsz> anyone knows the right one? i tried a few combos all fail
[15:06:45] <Eviltwin> jarr0dsz: This is #jquery
[15:06:55] <jarr0dsz> ahah sorry bad channel ;)
[15:07:01] <pushp0p> jquery on rails
[15:07:10] <Eviltwin> Krinkle: ?
[15:07:28] <Krinkle> Eviltwin: quickly hover in and out of the brown box
[15:07:53] <Krinkle> the slides will build up a queue and continue after having stopped hovering in and out
[15:09:24] <theBrettman> use hoverflow
[15:11:05] <_ramo> how can i prevent in jquery ui datepicker that a date from the future can be selected?
[15:12:15] <Krinkle> theBrettman: I'm not currently needing this for anything, just general curiosity. In code written in the past, using .stop() has worked just fine.
[15:13:51] <_ramo> ah maxdate should be good
[15:14:03] <theBrettman> .stop() sucks for that. checkout hoverflow: http://www.2meter3.de/code/hoverFlow/
[15:14:48] <theBrettman> it shows a good example of why stop() sucks for what you want
[15:17:11] <_ramo> theBrettman: is it easily possible to show a overlay over a picture with links on that overlay when i hover over a picture?
[15:19:11] <theBrettman> yes, if the action is done to a container holding both image and content
[15:19:19] <theBrettman> just like fb
[15:20:07] <sneakyness_wk> Do jquery and the webkit css3 animation properties play nice?
[15:20:09] <Krinkle> theBrettman: hoverFlow is nice, but on that demo page, .stop() is exactly what I want, the css-like behavior where aborting of hover event also aborts the animation and starts the next one from the current half-way state
[15:20:15] <theBrettman> cuz it can't be a child of the image, lol
[15:20:17] <sneakyness_wk> I'm trying to use attr on -webkit-animation-name and it doesn't appear to be doing anything
[15:20:34] <theBrettman> oh, ok
[15:20:46] <theBrettman> I've never had an use for stop() yet...
[15:21:09] <Krinkle> http://api.jquery.com/stop/ scroll to the last example and see
[15:21:16] <Krinkle> toggle when it's half-way
[15:22:16] <theBrettman> yeah, I can see a lot of instances where it would work great. I prolly will use it in the near future!
[15:26:07] <Compeeler> yap
[15:30:23] <k1ng> how do i get rel of all a?
[15:30:24] <k1ng> $(this).parent().parent().find('a')
[15:30:33] <k1ng> $(this).parent().parent().find('a').attr('rel' ) doesnt work
[15:30:53] <Zzaichik> .parents('a') maybe?
[15:31:20] <whoever> need some assistence creating line breakes in a jquery created element i have tried text: "text\ntest" and the reslt does not contain a line brake nor does <br>
[15:31:26] <Compeeler> yap
[15:31:35] <theBrettman> you want all a so wouldn't it be $('a').attr('rel)?
[15:31:37] <k1ng> Zzaichik, i used ul
[15:31:50] <Krinkle> theBrettman: That gives attr val of eq(0) only
[15:31:56] <theBrettman> you can see I get a lot of syntax errors, lol
[15:32:09] <tigrang> if I need to run something after a page is fully loaded (all [other] js on the page is run) - do I need ready() or load
[15:32:12] <theBrettman> I left off an apostrophe
[15:32:25] <theBrettman> ready()
[15:32:29] <Zzaichik> k1ng: I'm not sure what you've got going on man. $(this).parents('a').attr('rel') is my best guess.
[15:32:31] <Compeeler> yap
[15:32:33] <theBrettman> load is while it's loading
[15:32:39] <tigrang> ok thanks
[15:32:41] <k1ng> $('.' + $('.jsmenu li a').parent().parent().find('a').attr('rel')).hide('slow');
[15:32:43] <Krinkle> k1ng: So you want an array with all rel="" values ?
[15:32:43] <k1ng> :(
[15:32:45] <k1ng> doesnt work
[15:32:51] <k1ng> Krinkle, yes
[15:32:52] <Compeeler> u should fix
[15:32:56] <Zzaichik> ahhh
[15:32:57] <whoever> or is the only way that i can do it $('element').text();
[15:33:02] <Compeeler> yas
[15:33:28] <whoever> Compeeler: just checkin, your talkin to me
[15:34:05] <Compeeler> yea
[15:34:15] <whoever> Compeeler: thx
[15:34:16] <StevenCodes22> whats my Alias someone tell me plz
[15:34:33] <Zzaichik> What's the extra  '.' for?
[15:34:38] <tash> I'm using a .get to run a server script, and the script returns something, how can I use jq to get the response from my .get?
[15:34:59] <k1ng> zackiv31, talking to me?
[15:35:06] <k1ng> so i can hide other div
[15:35:27] <whoever> StevenCodes22:  your purple

[15:36:30] <Krinkle> Zzaichik: He's trying to select a clasname

[15:40:52] <k1ng> well thanks i just added a class to make it easier
[15:40:53] <k1ng> :)
[15:41:16] <diverdude> I am trying to figure out how positioning works and i made this small example: http://www.webdevout.net/test?019...but i really dont understand why positive values of right and bottom makes the element overflow in the upper left corner?? I thought it would offset the element according to the right and bottom edges. What did I miss?
[15:47:16] <amaroks> hello guys, Im using form serialize and load on click
[15:47:24] <amaroks> But only working after 3-4 page refresh!
[15:47:49] <amaroks> searchfb.pagodabox.com/
[15:48:07] <amaroks> http://searchfb.pagodabox.com/ can be seen there
[15:48:48] <amaroks> anyone please?
[15:52:17] <red_square> amaroks - it makes the request. But you are trying to load the response into #items which doesnt exist
[15:52:37] <johnkpaul> amaroks: what is the problem you're having?
[15:53:28] <ibodi> coldhead: hi
[15:54:05] <coldhead> hii
[15:54:08] <ibodi> coldhead: finally i found out the cause of the error: .post() does not works
[15:54:28] <coldhead> post does not works!!?
[15:54:38] <coldhead> you found a bug?
[15:55:35] <ibodi> coldhead: <a href='...exe' class='log'> does not work || <p class='log'> this is work when $('#log').click(...post())
[15:56:10] <coldhead> ibodi: you need to return false in the click function
[15:56:17] <coldhead> otherwise it will follow the href
[15:56:28] <amaroks> red_square,jphnkpaul
[15:56:33] <amaroks> red_square,johnkpaul
[15:56:36] <coldhead> it's good that you fixed it ibodi!
[15:56:39] <coldhead> nice work
[15:56:43] <ibodi> coldhead: ah.. that's the trick ? let me try again .
[15:56:45] <amaroks> it makes the request but the values of form fields are empty
[15:56:54] <amaroks> unless you do 4-5 page refresh and try to submit again
[15:57:32] <johnkpaul> amaroks: what should I be putting in the input field to try this?
[15:57:46] <red_square> amaroks - ok so serialize just before the post, no on doc ready
[15:57:47] <amaroks> any keyword
[15:58:08] <amaroks> before what?
[15:58:16] <red_square> inside the click event
[15:58:28] <red_square> not when the page has just loaded
[15:58:36] <johnkpaul> move this line
[15:58:37] <johnkpaul> var param = $("form").serialize();
[15:58:47] <johnkpaul> to inside the click callback
[15:59:58] <ibodi> coldhead: well. return false,: the log works, however, i m trying to log a download, so if return false, the download link will not work :D
[16:00:46] <ibodi> coldhead: still need to work around another way :)
[16:01:10] <coldhead> ibodi: so you need to wait until the post() is finished before you start the download
[16:01:13] <coldhead> that's easy
[16:01:39] <coldhead> in the post() success callback just put window.location = $(this).attr('href');
[16:01:44] <coldhead> and leave the return false in
[16:01:57] <coldhead> then it won't follow load the href until the post() is completed
[16:02:26] <adac> hi guys. how can i start this also "onload" http://pastebin.com/xbtd78Zi
[16:03:30] <ibodi> coldhead: ah. i was doing that in the past, some js-browser stop work, so we try to make the download always working, and log for js enabled users.
[16:03:45] <coldhead> that will stil work
[16:03:52] <coldhead> because none of that will happen without js
[16:03:57] <coldhead> it will just be a regular <a>
[16:04:14] <ibodi> coldhead: mmm great! thanks for that . trying...
[16:04:53] <coldhead> good luck babe
[16:05:19] <someprimetime> is ibodi a real babe or what?
[16:05:42] <ibodi> :)
[16:11:03] <amaroks> red_square thanks
[16:11:06] <amaroks> that fixed it
[16:11:48] <red_square> np
[16:17:26] <Zxurian> so hoping someone can enlighten me. I'm using the following code (http://pastebin.com/ix8JTEKS) to load an image in the background, and when it's loaded, display it as the background of the site. In Explorer, when visiting a page (http://clintonct.org) the background iamge will not display unless you goto the page, then refresh it.
[16:24:36] <red_square> 3.9mb image....
[16:27:33] <adac> hi guys. how can i start this also "on load" http://pastebin.com/xbtd78Zi
[16:28:36] <red_square> adac - extract the function
[16:29:52] <adac> red_square, what do you mean exactly with "extraction of a function" if I may ask?
[16:30:04] <ibodi> coldhead: now works! however i put the window.location in both success().error() bit , and i tested , they always goto the error bit
[16:30:15] <Zxurian> red: I know it's a 3.9mb image, but even when cached, it still doesn't load unless refreshed
[16:30:25] <coldhead> ibodi: that must mean there is a problem with your post()
[16:30:38] <coldhead> either a 404 or the server is sending back nothing or garbage
[16:31:03] <red_square> adac like http://pastebin.com/Vepv7uhE
[16:31:11] <ibodi> coldhead: oh. u r right. .post(url) only does not feedback anything.
[16:31:36] <ibodi> coldhead: fixing again ... :)
[16:34:30] <overthemike> has anyone in here used dojo much?
[16:34:47] <ibodi> coldhead: nope. .post(url,function(data){ }) still goes to .error() bit
[16:35:21] <adac> red_square, thanks i will try taht out. but now its bedtime! sleep well guys!
[16:35:22] <ibodi> coldhead: the post(url) must work, as the log is successful
[16:35:29] <tash> got disconnected, so re-asking...sorry if someone already answered: I'm using a .get to run a server script, and the script returns something, how can I use jq to get the response from my .get?
[16:35:46] <coldhead> ibodi: if the server doesn't send anything back post() assumes there has been an error
[16:35:53] <red_square> use the callback func tash
[16:36:01] <chovy> howdy
[16:36:17] <chovy> does anyone know when .live() and .bind() apis will be removed from jQuery? ie: what release?
[16:36:22] <chovy> They are still present in 1.7
[16:36:41] <bonhoffer> any insight into why jquery is forcing each page to do a lookup (json) -- for example: http://localhost:3000/backend/friends.json from /backend/friends get request
[16:36:44] <ibodi> coldhead: ah. in this case , yes. because log-url does not send back anything. so i assume it will be always error() :)
[16:36:57] <overthemike> chovy: I doubt for a while due to backwards compatability
[16:37:24] <red_square> bonhoffer forcing?
[16:37:32] <red_square> you mean not cached?
[16:37:47] <ibodi> coldhead: i put win.loc in both .success().error() anyway, just in case jquery changed rules in the future, make sure both working.
[16:37:55] <chovy> overthemike: 1.8 or more like 2.0?
[16:38:04] <bonhoffer> red_square: i'm not sure of the right terms, but everytime i load the page, that request is submitted after page load
[16:38:11] <bonhoffer> really scratching my head
[16:38:20] <red_square> bonhoffer are you making an ajax request for it
[16:38:37] <overthemike> chovy: well I probably would be the best person to ask, but my guess would be around 1.9ish - 2.0
[16:38:39] <bonhoffer> red_square: yes, that is happening, but i have no idea why
[16:38:39] <chovy> bonhoffer: do you have an example?
[16:38:57] <red_square> bonhoffer can you paste your script/page
[16:39:01] <tash> red_square: duh, thanks
[16:39:08] <chovy> overthemike: ok
[16:39:08] <bonhoffer> chovy: no, it is on localhost, and i have no idea how this is getting called
[16:39:08] <tash> sometimes I have to shake my head at myself
[16:39:12] <tash> tash = newb!
[16:39:17] <bonhoffer> i'll try to copy to a demo site
[16:39:27] <chovy> bonhoffer: it probably is getting fired in an onload event
[16:39:34] <red_square> bonhoffer well paste the source as first step
[16:39:38] <Zxurian> red_square: any other ideas?
[16:39:43] <bonhoffer> chovy: i'm guessing that is true
[16:39:50] <chovy> $(function(){ $.get('/backend/friends', {}, fn) }); //?
[16:40:00] <coldhead> good work, ibodi
[16:40:02] <chovy> bonhoffer: grep for /backend/friends
[16:40:02] <coldhead> best wishes
[16:40:18] <sven_oostenbrink> I have a div selected, but I need to know howmany divs are inside that div.. How can I do that? I tried .children() but that gave me nothing..
[16:40:28] <bonhoffer> chovy: that definitely doesn't exist . .. one sec i'll try some ideas
[16:40:30] <chovy> sven_oostenbrink:
[16:40:34] <red_square> ? .find @ sven_oostenbrink
[16:40:35] <bot-t1> sven_oostenbrink, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[16:40:44] <chovy> $("div#start").find("div").length
[16:40:56] <bonhoffer> i'm going to delete some javascript and see if i can isolate it
[16:41:17] <chovy> bonhoffer: somewhere the path is probably hardcoded.
[16:41:22] <chovy> to the ajax call.
[16:41:31] <bonhoffer> no -- this happens for any page in my site,
[16:41:39] <bonhoffer> with the different resources
[16:41:40] <chovy> grep -rl '/backend/friends' ./scripts
[16:41:55] <sven_oostenbrink> red_square: checking..
[16:42:06] <bonhoffer> so, for example, backend/foo requests /backend/foo.json
[16:42:19] <bonhoffer> this might be jquery rest at work
[16:42:31] <chovy> bonhoffer: so it might be a variable like request.url
[16:42:43] <chovy> in rails, i'm assumign that's what you're using.
[16:42:47] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1673823
[16:42:59] <bonhoffer> yes, rails you are right . . .
[16:43:18] <chovy> bonhoffer:
[16:43:23] <chovy>  //= require backend/jquery.rest
[16:43:29] <chovy>  //= require backend/location
[16:43:33] <chovy> what are those doing?
[16:43:53] <bonhoffer> loading jquery.rest i'll pastebin that
[16:44:12] <chovy> it looks like maybe require backend/location is getting replaced with /backend/foo
[16:44:18] <chovy> if you're on example.com/foo
[16:45:11] <methods> is it possible to simply find out if something has a click event on it ?
[16:45:12] <sven_oostenbrink> red_square: mmm, I have a console.log of the original div, I see that it has child divs, so I .find('div') but that returns an empty array (according to console.log that is)
[16:45:15] <bonhoffer> i think that rest might be the issue
[16:45:18] <sven_oostenbrink> red_square: doing anything wrong?
[16:47:01] <bonhoffer> chovy: no, not jquery rest
[16:48:07] <chovy> bonhoffer: i think baqckend/location
[16:48:27] <bonhoffer> hmm. ..  i don't think so, that is a coffescript file that does mapping code
[16:49:27] <bonhoffer> chovy: no -- i bet it is fullcalendar . .
[16:49:51] <bonhoffer> wait, i think you are right
[16:49:59] <chovy> bonhoffer: yes
[16:50:04] <chovy> I know I am :)
[16:50:41] <bonhoffer> i didn't see it . . . hmm. . .
[16:50:45] <bonhoffer> but it is there
[16:51:03] <bonhoffer> did you see it on github?
[16:51:13] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1673850
[16:51:41] <bonhoffer> i'm moving stuff around . . . i don't know why i have that run by default . . .
[16:52:02] <chovy> $.getJSON window.location.pathname + ".json", (data) -> loadUserMap parseFloat(data.lat), parseFloat(data.lon)
[16:52:07] <chovy> that's what is doing it.
[16:52:13] <chovy> what is this crap anyway?
[16:52:17] <chovy> it isn't javascript
[16:52:31] <chovy> some lame abstraction language?
[16:52:46] <chovy> glade or something?
[16:53:21] <bonhoffer> coffeescript
[16:53:35] <chovy> why do people use stuff like that
[16:54:05] <chovy> does it really add any value?
[16:54:09] <bonhoffer> but why is  if $("#location-map") returning true
[16:54:18] <bonhoffer> chovy: yes, it is a lot cleaner for me
[16:54:22] <bonhoffer> it compiles to js
[16:54:33] <bonhoffer> but i know i'm on thin ice talking about it here
[16:54:34] <sven_oostenbrink> I have a div selected, and this div has child divs.. Now, I have used children(), find(), etc.. But whatever I do, I can not select these children, is this a common problem?
[16:54:45] <bonhoffer> some people have the same complaint about jquery, but i love it
[16:55:18] <bonhoffer> http://js2coffee.org/
[16:57:06] <sven_oostenbrink> if I do console.log($('div#test').children); on a HTML document <div id='text'><div id='foobar'></div></div>, I should see <div id='foobar'></div> in the browser console, not??
[16:58:44] <aidan> How can I do something like this: $("select:not([name*='day'],[name*='year'],[name*='month'],:parent([id='block-admin-display-form']))");
[16:58:51] <bonhoffer> chovy: i need to have if $("#location-map").length > 0 in there
[17:01:12] <donCams> hi. how do you append a new Element into where your cursor is located (editor)
[17:05:01] <aidan> :not(:parent#block-admin-display-form) ?
[17:08:54] <sven_oostenbrink> if I do console.log($('div#test').children); on a HTML document <div id='text'><div id='foobar'></div></div>, I should see <div id='foobar'></div> in the browser console, not??
[17:09:57] <dnsdds> How can I build a selector that only selects elements where opacity != 0?
[17:10:18] <red_square> children() sven_oostenbrink
[17:12:42] <red_square> dnsdds do a test an each, test return where .css('opacity') != 0
[17:13:03] <red_square> uggh its late, ^^ you get my drift
[17:13:13] <dnsdds> Sounds ominous
[17:17:35] <red_square> dnsdds $('*').filter( function() { return $(this).css('opacity') != 0 })
[17:18:19] <red_square> not that I would do that ever on all nodes, but
[17:21:22] <grom358> is there an easy way I can clone all the styles?
[17:24:58] * someprimetime wonders why jsfiddle defaults to mootools
[17:25:27] <Blazento> hi, i was wondering if anyone knew of a way to reset all styles and load an external stylesheet inside of a jquery dialog. I'd like to have the effect of an iframe without having to fetch with an http request
[17:31:28] <amoe> Hey, should this work -- $.load(...)  I get the message $.load is not a function.    Trying to use code from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7065299/
[17:31:54] <amoe> I barely know jquery at all and that bare $. syntax confuses me a bit,  plus it's hard to google
[17:33:13] <coldhead> if it says that's not a function that generally means either jQuery isn't loaded or soething has stolen the $ variable from jQuery
[17:33:35] <coldhead> try replacing the $ like so: jQuery.load(...)
[17:33:43] <theBrettman> you don't need to use load. you can wrap it in (function($){...})(jQuery)
[17:34:02] <coldhead> i suspect he's using the ajax load
[17:34:07] <theBrettman> oh
[17:34:20] <amoe> yes, that was the load I wanted, to extract multiple fragments
[17:35:21] <theBrettman> idk what I was thinking, lol that woulda been .on('load', function(){});
[17:35:35] <amoe> I think jQuery.load is not bound even in a tiny test page...  so that answer confused me
[17:36:44] <coldhead> amoe: try alert(jQuery.fn.jquery)
[17:36:47] <Wjp2> Doesnt load do script injection?
[17:36:49] <coldhead> that should show you the version number
[17:36:53] <coldhead> if it's there at all
[17:50:51] <guy> It would be plain awesome if jQuery provided alternative to .css({left: e.clientX, top: e.clientY})
[17:51:23] <guy> which would allow to set position relative to a selected element or window itself, rather than relative to parent.
[17:57:50] <guy> oh. shit. jquery-ui has that.
[18:07:29] <theBrettman> can you append to an element that is inside an iframe?
[18:09:15] <guy> theBrettman: is the iframe links to an URL on another domain? no.
[18:14:14] <oojacoboo> we're suppose to always use .prop() over .attr() now right?
[18:14:14] <theBrettman> cool. I was hoping I could
[18:14:22] <theBrettman> we r?
[18:14:33] <theBrettman> I dint kno that
[18:14:40] <oojacoboo> everything isn't technically an attr according to the DOM
[18:14:46] <oojacoboo> so jQuery had hacks in place for that
[18:14:50] <theBrettman> what is?
[18:14:52] <oojacoboo> AFAIK, can someone confirm?
[18:15:14] <theBrettman> ask Eviltwin
[18:16:03] <kborchers> oojacoboo: no, only when its a prop and not an attr
[18:16:06] <ngharo> properties like disabled or checked vs attributes like name or href
[18:16:26] <oojacoboo> mmm
[18:16:31] <theBrettman> good to know
[18:16:43] <oojacoboo> I could have sworn I was reading to use prop in all cases moving forward
[18:16:55] <rorx> how can I set a global variable from inside .ready() ?
[18:19:00] <oojacoboo> kborchers: I see, so jQuery basically abandoned the hack and stuck with the js defaults on the matter
[18:20:34] <kborchers> oojacoboo: sort of ... attr still works on props but to "unset" a prop like disabled, you have to use removeAttr, so just use them in the appropriate ways and you'll be fine
[18:21:01] <oojacoboo> right
[18:22:28] <theBrettman> how should I store json? db? file?
[18:51:12] <destryalhmns> anyone know anything about jquery bridge?

[19:05:59] <kborchers> destryalhmns: if you read that page i provided, it will explain it
[19:07:01] <bobbobbins> destryalhmns, i missed what you said because you didn't use my name
[19:07:04] <bobbobbins> sorry
[19:07:04] <destryalhmns> i got here at [21:50] sry if i was ignorant. ive never seen that before outside of regex
[19:07:22] <destryalhmns> can you repost it pls? i would really like to know

[19:08:41] <destryalhmns> *note that bot is broke
[19:08:45] <destryalhmns> manually googling it...
[19:09:35] <destryalhmns> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[19:09:44] <kborchers> destryalhmns: bot is not broke, both of those links work just fine
[19:10:05] <destryalhmns> the second one is just a random google
[19:10:15] <destryalhmns> which can be biased based on previous searches
[19:10:19] <destryalhmns> the first in a general
[19:10:29] <destryalhmns> *IS
[19:10:42] <destryalhmns> either way, you are right and i am wrong
[19:10:52] <destryalhmns> the selector woudl work, thx for sharing
[19:10:58] <kborchers> no problem
[19:12:10] <rorx> how can I init a global variable from inside .ready() ?
[19:13:15] <destryalhmns> i dont want to be wrong twice in a row but have you tried just not using the keyword var?
[19:13:55] <kborchers> rorx: globals are bad, there is probably a better way to do what you are trying. see ?demo
[19:13:56] <bot-t1> rorx, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:15:45] <rorx> kborchers: yeah I didn't ask for an opinion if they're bad on not, but how to do it. in my case I need to init some variables for a third party script (google adwords in this case) so that it can run appropriately.
[19:16:14] <destryalhmns> myvar = 3;
[19:16:34] <kborchers> rorx: i appologize for the opinion but i will not help you write bad code. good luck :)
[19:16:42] <destryalhmns> if you don't include var it become global. ... not sure if this is the case even inside of a closure but i would think it would be
[19:17:23] <rorx> kborchers: hah, nice, this has nothing to do with bad code however, but it's simply that the third party expects its vars in the global scope to function.
[19:18:50] <rorx> destryalhmns: yeah, that's my understanding.. but have not been having much luck getting that to work.. I've also tried setting them on the window object as that's supposed to work as well, ie. "window.myglobalvar = 'foo';"
[19:20:02] <kvnn> rorx: i might be able to help, whats the problem?
[19:20:10] <destryalhmns> if you are outside of the context with the code is called it wont work
[19:20:35] <destryalhmns> so yo umay have to refer to the context of the window  you are messing with if you are using iframes
[19:21:17] <destryalhmns> like if you are in iframeA but the code is in iframeB.... you cant call shit inside B
[19:21:30] <destryalhmns> so you have to create a reference from A to B?
[19:21:44] <tfittsy> I'm trying to make an autocomplete because I don't like the jquery ui one.  Is settimeout the best way to prevent too many ajax calls when a person is typing fast?
[19:21:45] <rorx> destryalhmns: yeah, understood.. no frames in this case.
[19:22:19] <destryalhmns> cross domain?
[19:22:21] <destryalhmns> idk
[19:22:21] <bobbobbins> so im trying this: $('[page="' + page + '"]').fadeIn('slow'); and its making all the divs on my page visible, even ones without the page attribute, any idea why?
[19:22:33] <rorx> I'll try checking for the var in a different <script> fragment, perhaps it doesn't come into scope until the <script> fragment that defines it is done.
[19:23:45] <destryalhmns> no immediatly...
[19:23:56] <destryalhmns> *not
[19:24:10] <kborchers> tfittsy: yes see ?g javascript debounce
[19:24:11] <bot-t1> tfittsy, Debouncing Javascript Methods | unscriptable.com - http://unscriptable.com/?p=698
[19:24:49] <destryalhmns> thats the entire scope of the problem?
[19:35:26] <tfittsy> kborchers: do you use that function?  if so can you tell me really quickly how I would pass a normal function(event) to that?
[19:35:44] <Eviltwin> ?
[19:35:58] <kborchers> i do not, it was more for an explanation
[19:36:05] <tfittsy> oh, ok
[19:36:16] <kborchers> a combination of setTimeout and clearTimeout is what you want
[19:36:26] <destryalhmns> OR
[19:36:35] <kborchers> setTimeout to get your data
[19:36:39] <destryalhmns> var myGayFunct = thatFunct;
[19:36:47] <Eviltwin> Are you looking for something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/PPNBW/1/
[19:37:01] <destryalhmns> myActualFunct(myGayFunct);
[19:37:04] <kborchers> clearTimeout on each additional key press to stop the existing timer and start a new one
[19:37:08] <destryalhmns> i think that creates a closure
[19:37:25] <kborchers> tfittsy: see Eviltwin's example, that is what you want
[19:39:52] <destryalhmns> yeah that is a function to a function
[19:40:06] <destryalhmns> does that answer your question at all though?
[19:40:32] <tfittsy> Eviltwin: does that pass the original object in to the called function?
[19:40:46] <Eviltwin> No but that's pretty trivial to do
[19:41:04] <Eviltwin> If you don't know how to do that, you need to learn JavaScript / jQuery
[19:41:06] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ tfittsy
[19:41:07] <bot-t1> tfittsy, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[19:42:02] <destryalhmns> maybe try to explain the question better
[19:42:07] <destryalhmns> dont be intimidated
[19:42:21] <webPragmatist> how can i get the current form that my cursor or selector is focused in?
[19:42:39] <webPragmatist> i basically want to call the submit function on the current focused form
[19:42:39] <Eviltwin> $(<focused element>).closest("form")
[19:42:47] <kborchers> Eviltwin: you have a key combination set up for ?learn yet ;)
[19:42:49] <tfittsy> it's what I'm after, I'm just wondering if I have to pass the object and event into the setTimeout function or if there is another way
[19:42:52] <Eviltwin> ?.closest @ webPragmatist
[19:42:53] <bot-t1> webPragmatist, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:43:00] <Eviltwin> kborchers: There's a reason I made it short ;)
[19:43:04] <kborchers> heh
[19:43:18] <bobbobbins> so why didn't my selector work? $('[page="' + page + '"]').fadeIn('slow');
[19:43:37] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: i'm more interested how to get the focused element
[19:43:41] <webPragmatist> in *
[19:44:02] <Eviltwin> Oh, I think... see ?:focus
[19:44:02] <bot-t1> Oh, :focus: [New in v1.6] Selects element if it is currently focused. http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[19:44:05] <Eviltwin> That
[19:44:05] <destryalhmns> bob that code should work as far as i know, i think everyone needs more scope
[19:44:50] <destryalhmns> ususally you can't blame jquery unless jquery does something gay like .closest going up up the logical tree instead of up the actual file
[19:44:56] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: thanks
[19:45:11] <bobbobbins> destryalhmns, well its making every div fadein instead of just the ones with that attribute
[19:45:25] <kborchers> destryalhmns: let's not use that term please
[19:45:32] <destryalhmns> change it to "p" and see if it freaks out, reality check
[19:45:49] <destryalhmns> well if you are going to boot me boot me now
[19:46:13] <destryalhmns> .;
[19:46:31] <webPragmatist> if i have two submit buttons which does .submit() choose?
[19:46:42] <webPragmatist> or does it
[19:46:58] <kborchers> i would rather not kick you, just clean that up a little please
[19:47:56] <destryalhmns> yeah i dont think the word gay is a dirty word and i belive that you thinking the word gay is a dirty word only makes the word worse
[19:48:09] <kborchers> it's not the word, it's the way you use it
[19:48:10] <laurenty> Which is broken? jQueryUI Draggable or Selectable?http://jsfiddle.net/laurenty/QJ7Cj/
[19:48:10] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3.org/Submission/web-forms2/#changes
[19:48:24] <destryalhmns> sry dude
[19:48:27] <Eviltwin> "The first submit button in a form is the form's default button. If the platform supports submitting a form implicitly (for example, on some platforms hitting the "enter" key while a text field is focused implicitly submits the form), then when doing so the first submit button, this default button, must be the one used to initiate form submission"
[19:48:42] <destryalhmns> ive been booted before and dont care about getting booted again because you think you enlightened
[19:48:51] <destryalhmns> GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[19:49:01] <webPragmatist> my goodness
[19:49:06] <laurenty> wow...
[19:49:50] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: is there an easy way to add a value for "Save" ?
[19:49:59] <webPragmatist> meaning submit with name=...
[19:50:49] <webPragmatist> (sorry i'm not being clear)â€¦ basically I guess add a value to an attribute and then submit I suppose
[19:51:19] <webPragmatist> I have two submit buttons one is name update and one is name update_and_return
[19:51:26] <Eviltwin> Okay
[19:55:34] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: i could search for name="update"
[19:55:43] <webPragmatist> and click() ? but that sucks
[19:56:54] <Eviltwin> Well if you want to empulate clicking a particular button, that's what you have to do
[19:57:44] <webPragmatist> well i don't need to submit() would work if i can figure out how to add the value normally added by the submit button (update or update_and_return)
[19:59:37] <Eviltwin> The only way to alter what is sent to the server during a browser form submission is to change the form itself
[19:59:46] <Eviltwin> Such that it serializes the way you want it to
[20:00:17] <webPragmatist> is one method better than the other?
[20:01:55] <coldboot> How do you make the clickmap of a "display: block" element to only be the size of its actual contents?
[20:02:30] <coldhead> click.. map?
[20:02:51] <coldboot> When I make a div clickable, it's clickable all the way to the edge of its container.
[20:02:54] <Eviltwin> The area you can click in, I think
[20:03:00] <coldboot> Yeah.
[20:03:01] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ coldboot
[20:03:02] <bot-t1> coldboot, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:03:04] <bobbobbins> ok, so i changed my thing to this: $('div .question_display[page="' + page + '"]').fadeIn('slow');
[20:03:04] <bobbobbins> basically it has to have that class and that attribute...but it doesn't like that one bit, how do i rewrite that so it works properly?
[20:03:52] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ bobbobbins
[20:03:53] <bot-t1> bobbobbins, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:05:53] <coldboot> I can't get the click handler to work in the demo.
[20:06:14] <Eviltwin> coldboot: That's your problem
[20:06:22] <Eviltwin> :P
[20:06:24] <coldboot> Eviltwin: No, the click handler works in my actual code.
[20:06:33] <coldboot> Basically when I add a click handler to a div, since a div takes up a whole line, the whole line is clickable. If I only have a word in the div, how do I make it so only that word is clickable?
[20:07:02] <Eviltwin> At least show the HTML/CSS
[20:07:20] <bobbobbins> heres a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/9bLkw/
[20:07:21] <Eviltwin> In the demo
[20:08:18] <Eviltwin> bobbobbins: You don't see any problems with this selector? "div .question_display[page="102"]"
[20:09:04] <bobbobbins> Eviltwin, should i? it seems ok to me
[20:09:14] <coldboot> Open your console and notice that it says "hello" when you click to the right of the word displayed in the "result" pane: http://jsfiddle.net/geSXM
[20:09:30] <Eviltwin> bobbobbins: What does it select?
[20:09:31] <abjorn> coldboot wat
[20:09:48] <abjorn> there's coldboot and coldheat
[20:09:52] <abjorn> coldhead, even
[20:09:56] <abjorn> this is too much cold to take
[20:10:00] <Eviltwin> coldboot: Is this your actual page?
[20:10:08] <bobbobbins> well it should select a div with a class question_display and an attribute page set to 102
[20:10:12] <Eviltwin> Why isn't this a <span> or <a> or something then?
[20:10:34] <coldboot> Eviltwin: I want everything to wrap after the <span>
[20:10:48] <coldboot> Eviltwin: No, but it's analogous to it.
[20:10:56] <Eviltwin> coldboot: Your whole site is one word?
[20:11:03] <Eviltwin> Dude, little bigger
[20:11:08] <coldboot> Hilarious
[20:11:22] <Eviltwin> I realize that the <div> spans the whole way
[20:11:31] <Eviltwin> But I need to see what your structure is like
[20:11:41] <coldboot> I guess I want a <span> and <br>, then.
[20:11:47] <Eviltwin> Sure
[20:11:52] <coldboot> <li> spans the whole width as well.
[20:12:00] <Eviltwin> That's because it's also a block
[20:14:02] <bobbobbins> my brain must be totally fried, because i can't see whats wrong with my selector
[20:14:12] <Eviltwin> bobbobbins: What are you trying to select?
[20:14:24] <Eviltwin> Or rather, what does this select? "div .question_display[page="102"]"
[20:15:01] <Eviltwin> bobbobbins: ?
[20:15:05] <Eviltwin> Come on
[20:15:08] <Eviltwin> You wrote it
[20:16:22] <bobbobbins> oh
[20:16:25] <bobbobbins> wait
[20:16:32] <bobbobbins> div.question_display
[20:16:36] <Eviltwin> Yup
[20:17:02] * bobbobbins smacks himself
[20:19:59] <webPragmatist> is this still a legit plugin?
[20:19:59] <webPragmatist> https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys
[20:24:23] <coldhead> that was never a really serious plugin, webPragmatist
[20:24:25] <coldhead> ?tias
[20:24:26] <bot-t1> Try It And See
[20:28:35] <lgedeon> bobbobbins: how did you smack yourself?
[20:29:00] <theBrettman> facepalm?
[20:29:23] <bobbobbins> yeah, facepalmed it
[20:29:48] <lgedeon> actually trying to figure out the syntax for the italics thing :)
[20:30:06] <lgedeon> _maybe?_
[20:30:12] <lgedeon> *nope*
[20:30:30] <Eviltwin> depends on the client
[20:31:00] <Eviltwin> plus colors are off here
[20:31:45] <lgedeon> using linkinus at the moment
[20:32:42] <kborchers> lgedeon: /me ...
[20:33:01] <Eviltwin> Oy
[20:33:02] <Eviltwin> Oh*
[20:33:04] <Eviltwin> You mean
[20:33:07] * lgedeon cool
[20:33:07] * Eviltwin does something like this?
[20:33:17] <lgedeon> yes!!! thank you!
[20:33:33] <Eviltwin> It's called an "action"
[20:33:48] <Eviltwin> Usually start with a verb in the third person
[20:34:43] <lgedeon> Cool! So there are others? Now I now what to search for.
[20:35:03] <Eviltwin> No
[20:35:17] <Eviltwin> I mean you usually do something like /ME left the party early
[20:35:26] <ch3mical_> irc noobs are funny :)
[20:35:28] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[20:38:23] <lgedeon> very cool, thanks guys. I will get out of the way and let you get back to jQuery stuff. I just saw that for the 100th time and had to ask.
[20:45:04] <tash1> if I have a parent <tr> and give it an id like, id="inv-<?=$id?>", which outputs html like this: id="inv-1234" ... and I have a <td> within the <tr> which has an id like id="price" ... can't I do something like this?   $("#inv" + id.price).text("test");  to put the text "test" in the <td> where 'id' in my function is a valid variable?
[20:45:09] <tash1> what a long question!
[20:46:33] <tash1> in my function, that should be $("#inv-" +id.price) ... which in human eyeball language equals inv-1234
[20:46:54] <tash1> so, (inv-1234.price).text("test");
[20:48:26] <webPragmatist> coldhead: ?
[20:48:31] <kborchers> tash1: since id's are unique, you just do $("#price").text("test");
[20:48:38] <webPragmatist> coldhead: why wouldn't i be a serious plugin?
[20:49:27] <coldhead> it's main use is so people can enter the konami code
[20:49:54] <coldhead> i phrased that badly, i should have said it's not the most important plugin
[20:50:27] <coldhead> the most important plugin is obviously http://coreymedia.com/2011/04/jquery-wiggle/
[20:51:58] <webPragmatist> hrm
[20:53:53] <tash1> kborchers: thanks!
[20:54:08] <tash1> tweaked some logic so it would make more sense, and doing it that way worked
[20:54:19] <kborchers> cool
[20:55:56] <tash1> using a jqui modal form, when I close the modal form and re-open, the form fields still have data in them...any idea how to clear them when I close the dialog?
[20:56:05] <tash1> I close the dialog with $(this).dialog("close");
[20:57:40] <webPragmatist> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/aekhadjwfyukrq43i5b5a
[20:58:02] <webPragmatist> any idea how i can test these?
[20:58:52] <Eviltwin> Use the event's keyCode
[20:59:14] <abjorn> yeah, jq-wiggle is the best plugin.
[20:59:19] <abjorn> coldhead is correct
[20:59:50] <webPragmatist> stop being smart asses
[20:59:57] <webPragmatist> i'm trying to avoid having to figure out all the eventCodes
[21:00:24] <abjorn> 100% srs
[21:01:43] <kborchers> tash1: you could call reset() on the form in the beforeClose event handler see ?ui.dialog
[21:01:44] <bot-t1> tash1, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[21:01:57] <kborchers> look at the events tab there
[21:02:26] <tigrang> is there a way to read css values of an element only from a specified css file(s). I guess what I need is more of a css reader(?) where it doesnt get calcualted values necessarily, but values inside of a css file with inherited values in mind. Know of anything like this?
[21:02:32] <abjorn> go ahead and try that webpragmatist i see no reason why not
[21:06:14] <sahana> hi all
[21:06:57] <sahana> to trigger a click event, i have tried 		
[21:06:57] <sahana> $('#thumbid').trigger('click');
[21:06:57] <sahana> $('#thumbid').click();
[21:06:57] <sahana> It doesn't work.

[21:06:57] <sahana> 1. click the link tondur. A popup will appear. click the link Jain. Jquery fancy box should appear. But it is not appearing.
[21:06:57] <sahana>  
[21:09:53] <sahana> any idea, how to proceed?
[21:12:37] <webPragmatist> abjorn: interesting (and probably not that you care) but cmd-s just isn't implemented with that plugin
[21:17:18] <sahana> how to trigger click event manually?
[21:17:46] <coldhead> ?trigger
[21:17:46] <bot-t1> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[21:18:06] <coldhead> or possibly $('#thing')[0].click()
[21:18:12] <coldhead> depending on what ur after
[21:19:05] <coldhead> abjorn is a very caring person
[21:20:03] <sahana> i have tried 		$('#thumbid').trigger('click'); and $('#thumbid').click();
[21:20:17] <sahana> it is not working
[21:21:06] <coldhead> $('#thumbid')[0].click()
[21:21:10] <coldhead> AS I SAID
[21:21:28] <Eviltwin> ?
[21:22:44] <sahana> even after putting [0] also not working
[21:23:08] <abjorn> I am very caring.
[21:23:17] <abjorn> I cared so much that I birthed into this world the finest plugin in all of existence.

[21:27:46] <coldhead> i don't get a popup when i click tondur
[21:28:27] <sahana> any popup blocker?
[21:30:19] <coldhead> no, there is an error in the console
[21:30:25] <coldhead> about the object not having a load method
[21:30:56] <sahana> oops, it is working for me.. what is the error u get?
[21:32:30] <kborchers> sahana: that page does not even include jQuery and the error is Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Document> has no method 'load'
[21:33:12] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ sahana
[21:33:23] <Eviltwin> Where's the bot?
[21:33:33] <Eviltwin> sahana: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[21:33:42] <coldhead> bot-t1: are you okay?
[21:33:46] <sahana> these are jquery library: <script type="text/javascript" src="../lib/fancybox/jquery.min.js"></script>
[21:33:48] <sahana> 	
[21:33:50] <sahana> 	<script type="text/javascript" src="../lib/fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js"></script>

[21:34:10] <Eviltwin> Don't paste more than a line or two here directly
[21:34:15] <Eviltwin> Use pastebin or something for more
[21:34:22] <tigrang> If an element has no style actually assigned in a stylesheet, css('width') still returns a value, the computed width. Is there a way to only get a value if theres a user-defined value
[21:35:53] <sahana> eviltwin: ok..
[21:35:57] <coldhead> tigrang: i think you'd have to parse the stylesheet
[21:44:52] <cameronz> this has got to be a bug.. computed style is width: 32px.. $('td').css('width') is returning 31
[21:44:59] <cameronz> what the fark :(
[21:49:22] <progrock`> anyone got any good advice on how to convince my boss that extjs is complete garbage?
[21:50:19] <gkatsev> it isn't complete garbage. Just partial. :>
[21:50:45] <progrock`> Well, I'll agree it may not be "complete garbage.. BUT I still need to convince him that it is complete garbage
[21:50:55] <gkatsev> haha
[21:51:14] <gkatsev> um... idk
[21:51:17] <progrock`> I'd still never use it, ever, under any circumstances that I have a choice, lol
[21:51:26] <progrock`> sadly, the new front end guy we hired is fucking married to that shit
[21:51:37] <FLeiXiuS> Can someone tell me why this gives me a http://pastie.org/3247995 gives errors?
[21:51:41] <progrock`> luckily I have much mor say... bt I cant do everything.. so I know hes gonna cnvince them at some point
[21:51:46] <symbolic> Just tell him jquery is much faster and does the same thing
[21:51:47] <gkatsev> i'm sorry
[21:52:03] <Eviltwin> FLeiXiuS: Don't use .live, ever, it's deprecated
[21:52:08] <progrock`> symbolic: lol, we'v beenusing jquery... its jsut he saw the grids, they're shiny.. his eyes lit up
[21:52:18] <progrock`> lol, live sucks the big one... 90% of the time
[21:52:27] <FLeiXiuS> Eviltwin, whats replacing live for objects that dont exist yet?
[21:52:27] <progrock`> but the new 'on' is fucking amazing
[21:52:39] <Eviltwin> FLeiXiuS: .delegate...in 1.4.2
[21:52:44] <progrock`> easiest evenet delegation I;ve ever seen... 2 thumbs up
[21:52:45] <Eviltwin> Or .on in 1.7+
[21:53:00] <sahana> coldhead: what is ur browser and version?
[21:53:44] <progrock`> FLeiXiuS: use 1.7.. so much better.... and you do $('#object that DOES exist thats closest to it').on('event', 'selectore of the object that doesnt exist', function(e){ ... })
[21:53:56] <symbolic> progrock: Ya, we had the same issue
[21:54:22] <FLeiXiuS> progrock`, Eviltwin, I'm stuck on 1.6.2 - cant change that.
[21:54:33] <progrock`> FLeiXiuS: , can I ask, why?
[21:54:39] <progrock`> the upgrade should be 100
[21:54:40] <progrock`> 5
[21:54:47] <progrock`> 100% painless
[21:54:53] <FLeiXiuS> progrock`, offline gov app
[21:54:56] <progrock`> ouch
[21:55:36] <progrock`> def glad I didnt take the job offer from general dynamic, lol... I def dont wanna be working for the government, even if by private contract
[21:56:42] <progrock`> symbolic: so yeah, I have so much on my table, otherwise i'd spend the couple of days and prove to my boss I can do everythin he likes in extjs, but more custmized for us.. soo afraid this new guy is gonna convince them extjs is great.... its fucking Object oriented.. any JS developer shuld instantl know thats fucktarded
[21:57:25] <MSK> setInterval not supporting firefox browser
[21:57:37] <FLeiXiuS> MSK, works for me ;-)
[21:57:57] <progrock`> MSK: what??
[21:58:02] <symbolic> progrock`: lol. Too funny
[21:58:05] <MSK> but i am having prob
[21:58:22] <progrock`> setInterval is ancient, and definitely suppotred
[21:58:56] <symbolic> And error prone. Dont call it in a loop
[21:59:24] <coldhead> sahana: chromium 18.0.996.0 (Developer Build 116287 Linux) Ubuntu 10.04
[21:59:55] <MSK> i am having prob in superfish menus (setInterval)
[22:00:08] <FLeiXiuS> Eviltwin, Even after switching to delegate, I cant get it to monitor both ajax:loading and ajax:complete events
[22:02:14] <progrock`> FLeiXiuS: have you tried ajaxStart and ajaxStop.. thats what im used to in jquery
[22:02:17] <CodeZombie> I've got a photo overlay that allows a user to modify (rotate) an uploaded photo. This photo lives on s3. After the ajax request returns I'm trying to 'refresh' the image, but it's cached. Appending a timestamp , and re-applying the image src attribute seems to work, but the next view of the image, still provides the old cached version. Does anyone know how to go about this, so the browsers cached version is replaced?
[22:02:59] <progrock`> CodeZombie: i think you can jsut add ?v=123213  or any other garabge thatll be igored
[22:03:05] <FLeiXiuS> progrock`, yields the same thing, works for start but not for stop
[22:03:14] <CodeZombie> coldhead: yeah, I"m going something like that here. https://gist.github.com/8fec1dbcc26a394914ea
[22:03:28] <progrock`> FLeiXiuS: post a fll example and i'll help you out
[22:03:33] <progrock`> full*
[22:03:56] <CodeZombie> only difference I guess it's I'm passing the timestamp itself, instead of using a param
[22:03:59] <CodeZombie> I'll give that a go
[22:03:59] <FLeiXiuS> That is the full example lol
[22:04:33] <FLeiXiuS> If I sepcify the callback events in separate delegate functions, it works perfectly.
[22:04:38] <FLeiXiuS> Figured I could nest them under one.
[22:04:39] <progrock`> link me aain, too lazy to scrol up
[22:04:47] <FLeiXiuS> http://pastie.org/3247995
[22:05:17] <progrock`> thats not really a full example.. i want one making the ajax request, etc.. so I can actually see whats going wrong
[22:05:34] <progrock`> i dont need to see any of your private code, just need a funcitoning example
[22:06:15] <FLeiXiuS> Add a <div class='nav_link'> done.
[22:07:05] <progrock`> umm, no not done.. you still dont have aomethign maing the ajax request...
[22:08:30] <FLeiXiuS> This is using data-remote  htm5
[22:08:55] <FLeiXiuS> I'll just create 2 listeners, it works...
[22:12:32] <progrock`> hhmmm, data-remote?... I;d say I;m pretty up to speed wth a lot of HTML5, not sure what ou mean by data-remote... i mean 'data-' is a generic way of attachingg any data to an dom element, lol.. but soudns like youre taking about somethign idfferent
[22:14:28] <FLeiXiuS> data-remote when set to true on an anchor will request an ajax event referencing the anchors href
[22:15:03] <FLeiXiuS> any who thanks.
[22:15:03] <FLeiXiuS> Im out
[22:21:47] <dmsuperman> Can I use a list of elements as a filter for another list? So say I select a bunch of nodes, if I pass that list to filter will I get basically every other node?
[22:22:28] <progrock`> dmsuperman: umm.. filter lets you programically decided to keep or not keep a list of elements...
[22:22:34] <dmsuperman> Or would it only return matching nodes
[22:22:50] <progrock`> describe what you're trying to do a little better please
[22:22:58] <progrock`> sounds liek youre hoping for a little too much magic
[22:23:44] <dmsuperman> I want to select (#a .b, #a .d):not(#x), then I want to use that to select every other node in #a
[22:23:59] <dmsuperman> I'm writing a narrow-as-you-type search thing
[22:24:24] <progrock`> what do you mean by every other node in #a?
[22:24:47] <dmsuperman> Hrm
[22:25:17] <progrock`> you could do $('a *').filter(':even')  though i doubt thats what you mean
[22:25:26] <progrock`> #a*
[22:26:01] <progrock`> BTW, lots of people have done search as you type ;)
[22:26:08] <dmsuperman> I think I have to do something more complex
[22:26:41] <dmsuperman> I was hoping to curry some selectors together but basically I want to apply the search directly to the DOM
[22:27:08] <dmsuperman> I want to match every row where the .title or .price fieldds match. I'm using this 'containsi' expression I nabbed on stackoverflow
[22:27:28] <dmsuperman> Then I wanted to quickly get a reference to every other row that I didn't match with this
[22:28:11] <dmsuperman> and teh containsi expr is basically just:  return (elem.textContent || elem.innerText || '').toLowerCase().indexOf((match[3] || '').toLowerCase()) >= 0
[22:29:31] <progrock`> so youre doing an inpage text search?
[22:29:45] <progrock`> I still dont undertsand this every other element, and how that makes any sense with a search
[22:30:32] <dmsuperman> I want to match every row (using only specific nodes within that row to search, ignoring others), then I want to take every other row and hide it
[22:30:36] <dmsuperman> rather than delete it
[22:31:17] <progrock`> ok, so you havea table, you're searching within specific cells... I stil dont get why you would hide every other row.. just soudns so arbitrary and strange
[22:31:28] <dmsuperman> not "every other" as in alternating
[22:31:34] <dmsuperman> but every other as in all the non-matching rows
[22:31:49] <dmsuperman> hahaha
[22:31:50] <dmsuperman> sorry
[22:31:55] <dmsuperman> that does seem confusing
[22:32:08] <progrock`> lol, yeah no kidding
[22:32:42] <dmsuperman> oh and the other thing I'm not sure about is building the selector such that I can match a child but have teh selector return the parent
[22:32:50] <dmsuperman> If I just add :parent after it will that move up one level?
[22:32:59] <progrock`> $('slector').parent()
[22:33:07] <dmsuperman> ah right derp
[22:33:16] <progrock`> or if ou need to ccrawl up to the tr.. $('selector').closest('tr')
[22:34:34] <dmsuperman> It's actually divs but basically rows. so I have this
[22:34:39] <dmsuperman> var matches = $('.part-list .part .title:containsi(' + value + '),.part-list .part .price:containsi(' + value + ')').parent('.part').filter(':not(#generic-part)');
[22:35:04] <progrock`> lol
[22:35:53] <dmsuperman> hehe
[22:36:13] <progrock`> gotta love how you jst combined about 40 lines of reguar JS, if not many more into 2
[22:36:19] <dmsuperman> so the issue now is trying to get every .part in .part-list which doesn't match this selector
[22:36:20] <progrock`> well, i guess 1
[22:36:25] <dmsuperman> oh yeah totally
[22:36:30] <dmsuperman> this is exactly why I'm using jquery
[22:36:35] <dmsuperman> low paying client needs some enhancements
[22:36:41] <dmsuperman> not worth it to write it all out
[22:36:41] <progrock`> I think you can just get the whole list, then use not
[22:36:53] <dmsuperman> .not(list) ?
[22:37:02] <progrock`> yu
[22:37:03] <progrock`> yup
[22:37:04] <dmsuperman> or some :not magic
[22:37:05] <dmsuperman> niiiice
[22:37:09] <dmsuperman> jquery I love you
[22:37:39] <dmsuperman> that makes this narrow-as-you-type-search-the-dom search about 5 total lines of code
[22:38:17] <progrock`> man, I remmebr interviewing this guy who claimed ot have 10 years of experienc (I boiled it down to 15 minutes for me)... and I was liek trying to spoon feed him answers, and he jsut coudlnt get it.  He claimed to really no jquery.. and i was like.. how do you selet somethigns parent
[22:38:30] <progrock`> and I was just like "Just guess... think about the most obviosu thing"...
[22:38:49] <progrock`> I think he got 2 of 10 questions.. and these were the warmups
[22:39:00] <cpgo>  .parent() ?
[22:39:10] <progrock`> I had 10 ears of experience, and claims 4-5 when interviewing, lol
[22:39:14] <progrock`> cpgo: you got it, lol
[22:39:18] <cpgo> I WIN :D
[22:39:20] <progrock`> claimed*
[22:39:32] <dmsuperman> yeah I totally get that
[22:39:55] <dmsuperman> my day job is trying to find talented scripting language guys and it's just so hard
[22:40:14] <dmsuperman> we're using node and perl so being able to get beyond hacking together things is key
[22:40:22] <dmsuperman> so many people don't get the difference or think HR won't know
[22:40:27] <progrock`> odly enough, the logo on my site (which I wasted too much time on, but was jsut fooling around) got me 4 really good job offers (which were my top4 choices ot of quite abunch)... kinda funny if you ask me
[22:40:42] <progrock`> node and perl, LOL.. thats so fuckign random
[22:40:47] <dmsuperman> hahaha
[22:40:53] <dmsuperman> well it was perl originally
[22:40:58] <dmsuperman> they hired me and I didn't know perl
[22:41:00] <progrock`> way too old in one hand, way too sketchy for producion in the otehr ;)
[22:41:19] <dmsuperman> so I learned it and it's alright but I don't care for it that much
[22:41:26] <progrock`> see.. i got hired and thy had php.. 3 days later, we started converting he enire platform to scala.. 1 and a half months later.. we did it
[22:41:31] <coldhead> perl is quietly awesome
[22:41:37] <dmsuperman> CPAN is amazing
[22:41:39] <dmsuperman> the best
[22:41:40] <dmsuperman> resource
[22:41:41] <dmsuperman> ever
[22:41:41] <coldhead> none of you would be here now if it wasn't for perl
[22:41:44] <progrock`> well at least perl hsa good regex supprt, lol
[22:41:53] <dmsuperman> I just don't much care for all the oddities of the perl language
[22:41:53] <progrock`> coldhead: heh, arguabl true
[22:42:01] <dmsuperman> given time I could learn em but it's not worth it to me
[22:42:06] <coldhead> john resig was partly inspired by perl
[22:42:07] <progrock`> yeah, perl is jsut too ancient... at least go with python, lol
[22:42:07] <dmsuperman> JS is so much easier to express in
[22:42:08] <coldhead> TRUE STORY
[22:42:18] <progrock`> coldhead: so was anyone who did develpoment before 2000
[22:42:23] <dmsuperman> heh
[22:42:34] <coldhead> yes us old timers really apprecaited perl
[22:42:38] <progrock`> luckily I never went beyond email forms and some real basic shit with perl
[22:43:38] <progrock`> 2 plaes I almsot worked for (shutterstock, and MLB) both are still perl shops
[22:43:47] <dmsuperman> perl is another thing that's hard to hire for
[22:44:04] <dmsuperman> a million people know how to do ETL with perl
[22:44:14] <dmsuperman> but writing object oriented...ish code
[22:44:24] <dmsuperman> abstraction and all that
[22:44:35] <progrock`> perl to me, now a days, should stick to system admins, lol
[22:45:00] <dmsuperman> yeah so that's why I got node going heh
[22:45:02] <dmsuperman> to transition away
[22:45:07] <Eviltwin> Perl is fantastic for one-offs
[22:45:15] <progrock`> stil, node jsut doesnt seem production redy for me
[22:45:24] <Eviltwin> But should be used cautiously elsewhere
[22:45:27] <progrock`> tho, I will be using it on a blog of mine, if I ever get the time to finish it
[22:45:32] <dmsuperman> it's doing pretty well under millions of hits a day
[22:45:47] <dmsuperman> using lots of abstraction and non-simple patterns
[22:46:02] <dmsuperman> millions of hits of regular traffic, so probably 10x that for node requests
[22:46:09] <joshualibrarian> okay, I just don't get it.  I want the .navList to slide one button to the right and left with the buttons... so close, but just doesn't do anything!  http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/22/
[22:46:26] <progrock`> thts prtty surprising...  you ising a database?... I take it using forever, what else to keep it runnign steady?
[22:46:38] <progrock`> using*
[22:46:41] <dmsuperman> mongodb using mongo native drivers
[22:47:03] <progrock`> yeah, we use mongo for our cache
[22:47:16] <progrock`> I guess its pretty cool you're using JS for DB, server side, and client side
[22:47:24] <dmsuperman> yeah that's a big thing for us
[22:47:27] <dmsuperman> we have a tonnnnn of code
[22:47:38] <dmsuperman> and we abandon it quickly
[22:47:42] <dmsuperman> so reuse is good for profits
[22:48:11] <dmsuperman> the only issues we ever have are logic issues and the like
[22:48:16] <brianfreud> Could I get some other people to run this test?   The results I'm seeing are...  surprising in how much better the object or module pattern works vs a switch...   http://jsperf.com/string-concat-vs-switch-vs-object
[22:48:30] <progrock`> dmsuperman: LOL, no kidding.. JS not being type safe or static.. kinda scary
[22:48:59] <dmsuperman> Yeah so there's a lot of input checking and validating heh
[22:49:02] <dmsuperman> that's most of the code
[22:49:12] <dmsuperman> beyond that it just takes JSON stuff and dumps it into mongo
[22:49:18] <dmsuperman> and applies business rules
[22:49:48] <progrock`> heh, I gues it depends on how much business logic you got.. we don;t do any business logic in JS.. but that should be a given since were using scala
[22:50:02] <progrock`> But, we're doing wuite a lot of calculations, on quite a lot of data, lol
[22:50:29] <dmsuperman> well I mean basic things. business data logic I guess
[22:51:00] <dmsuperman> the node service talks to the perl backend as well as the user via AJAX so we have to validate it all
[22:51:10] <progrock`> true.. yeah... I work in finance, we do a lot of analytics... and unit testing in a typesafe, static, and (in this case) functional language... much safe
[22:51:13] <progrock`> safer*
[22:51:18] <dmsuperman> yeah heh
[22:52:01] <progrock`> luckily I stay the fuck away from that shit.. scala is fuckign awesome.. but I have soooo much on my plate covering the front end, and all the data visualizations... I cant dal with the backnd calculations
[22:52:16] <progrock`> I get suckered into helping with mongo considering its JS
[22:53:05] <progrock`> BUT, the cool thing.. we dont support IE at all :)   so I get to use SVG evrywhere, among other cool shit
[22:54:14] <dmsuperman> nice
[22:54:16] <dmsuperman> scala seems cool
[22:54:21] <dmsuperman> haven't the time to check it out though
[22:56:08] <progrock`> dmsuperman: yeah, I wish I had more time to mess around with it... but they got 6 people on their team.. I'm practically solo (given 3 of the 6 have decent experience with front end)
[22:56:51] <progrock`> its fucking insane hw hard it is to find capable front end developers in NYC... BUT, its soo fucking easy to get a job :)
[22:57:19] <progrock`> I almost left my current position, I interviewd at 1 place... 5 minutes later they offered me quite the hefty number
[22:57:38] <dmsuperman> I'm in a similar position
[22:57:51] <dmsuperman> current job countered and I already knew I liked it so I stuck around
[22:57:57] <dmsuperman> now another place has come around
[22:58:02] <progrock`> on that note, any front end experts looking for a job in NYC... definitely loking.. BUT we do have a crazy interview process
[22:58:47] <progrock`> dmsuperman: my current one pulled an interesting move... basically, my new boss there I truely hated... SO.. they switched my department, my bosses are now the CEO and the cofounder.. the cofounder being the nicest guy there :)
[22:59:13] <progrock`> I'm now R&D... was on the "tech team" before that
[23:00:59] <progrock`> dmsuperman: I also got 100% flexible hours.. just need to show up before 4pm :)
[23:01:39] <dmsuperman> that's pretty cool
[23:02:25] <progrock`> yeah.. it was funny, since when I was first hired, they made all these claims.. didnt come through.. baically I made them give me what the promiseed and then some
[23:03:05] <progrock`> now all I need is some fuckign options in the company... come march I should have some.. that will be my early retirement money
[23:03:17] <Soopaman> progrock`: which company are you with?
[23:04:30] <joshualibrarian> Can anyone help out this jquery noob.  It's so close, but the JS doesn't seem to do anything, let alone shift the margin (to shift the buttons), whatever I do!  http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/24/
[23:04:36] <progrock`> Soopaman: relatively small financial startup in NYC
[23:05:22] <Soopaman> how is NYC's startup scene nowadays?
[23:05:26] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: I might be wrong, but Im not sure if you can do += or -= on a css animation
[23:05:49] <progrock`> Soopaman: they tear you a new asshole, but theres some really good ones... jsut need to make sure its a reliable place
[23:06:12] <joshualibrarian> progrock:  I can't get it to do ANYTHING to it at all, and have tried lots of selectors.
[23:06:16] <Soopaman> reliable as in get paid?
[23:06:23] <progrock`> Soopaman: basially, need to find plces where the owner and/or ceo are very dedicated and its not jsut a "will give it a shot for a year, if it doesnt work, I'm out"
[23:06:31] <progrock`> Soopaman: no reliable, like will be there next year
[23:06:46] <progrock`> LOL.. I would never work some where I was afraid of not getting paid
[23:07:18] <Soopaman> heheh
[23:07:36] <Soopaman> i do agree with how it's amazing how big NYC is
[23:07:42] <Soopaman> yet how few good web dev's there are
[23:08:08] <joshualibrarian> sitting here in the woods in the snow in a town of 300, NYC seems unfathomably large, and the last place I'd want to go!  ;)
[23:08:13] <Eviltwin> Like how many people are in this channel
[23:08:15] <coldhead> i know a lot of nyc devs who would take exeption to that
[23:08:18] <Eviltwin> And how few of them contribute in any way
[23:08:29] <coldhead> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME EVILTWIN
[23:08:32] <coldhead> I AM DOING MY BEST
[23:08:33] <coldhead> SHEESH
[23:08:37] <coldhead> NO PLEASING SOME PEOPLE
[23:08:43] <coldhead> IF I HAD OPS...
[23:09:25] <Eviltwin> Huh
[23:09:27] <coldhead> hahahhaha
[23:09:38] <Eviltwin> That's what that button does
[23:09:53] <coldhead> i'll get you some day, chanserv
[23:10:02] <Soopaman> coldhead: exception that they good enough to be considered few and far between?
[23:10:11] <Soopaman> they are*
[23:10:13] <progrock`> man joshualibrarian for some reason jsfiddle fucks up when i click next
[23:10:23] <progrock`> would be el funny if they were using that class in their html
[23:10:35] <joshualibrarian> progrock: I have the same code locally and it doesn't work either!
[23:10:36] <coldhead> there are lots of good NYC devs
[23:10:48] <coldhead> the big apple would spit them out if they sucked
[23:10:57] <coldhead> wait that came out wrong
[23:11:00] <coldhead> OH GOD SO DID THAT
[23:11:08] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: yeah, like I said, I dont think you can do +=  ... ou need to get the margin-left then subract
[23:11:19] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: i may be wrong.. it may allow you to do that shortvut
[23:11:37] <progrock`> heh, Gotham just got ranked the rudest city in the country, lol
[23:11:41] <sasori> oh hi, I need the $_SESSION['cart'] itself and put it inside a javascript func..my question is, how to do that within javascript so that I can use the data via ajax ?
[23:11:54] <joshualibrarian> progrock: I did find references saying I could, but regardless.  Try changing it to something that should definitionly work, like opacity: 0 or whatever... I can't get it to do anything to anything!
[23:12:34] <Eviltwin> sasori: var data = <?= json_encode($data); ?>
[23:13:19] <sasori> hmmn..lemme try that..thanks :D
[23:13:39] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: LOL
[23:13:43] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: i see the issue
[23:14:50] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: well 1 issue at least.. either need to make it marginLeft or 'margin-left'   you cant have a hyphen out of quotes in an oject key
[23:14:55] <progrock`> you need to camel case or wuote
[23:16:13] <joshualibrarian> progrock:  margin-left seems to be acting as a valid property throughout the CSS in this.  It's what gets the #control where it is....
[23:17:18] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: i got it, lol.. 1 sec.. fucking hate editing code outside of vim
[23:18:56] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: http://jsfiddle.net/2bcp6/1/
[23:19:23] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: though I dont agreewith the methodology... because if you click while animating, you no onger are on the dot
[23:19:43] <joshualibrarian> progrock: OOOOOH!
[23:19:54] <joshualibrarian> parseInt!
[23:19:59] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: margin-left is correct css... BUT In JAVASCRIPT you cannot have a hyphen as an object key without wrapping it in quotes
[23:20:10] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: what you can do is camel case if you dont like the quotes
[23:20:41] <joshualibrarian> progrock:  Oh... hey, the quotes are fine with me!
[23:21:07] <joshualibrarian> damn, I could probably use the "margin: top right bottom left" syntax too, eh?
[23:21:31] <hendry> I want to output code via a document.write, i.e. inline. How do I do that, since document.write does not work: http://jsfiddle.net/sSa5X/
[23:21:48] <joshualibrarian> progrock:  Thank you endlessly!
[23:22:05] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: hold n tho
[23:22:08] <progrock`> let me fix our bigge issue
[23:22:29] <joshualibrarian> oh
[23:22:29] <joshualibrarian> ?
[23:23:06] <progrock`> it fucks up if you click while animating
[23:23:30] <bobbobbins> how can i get a count of how many elements have a certain attribute?
[23:25:09] <hendry> How do I select all pre tags, with the src attribute?
[23:26:34] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: I think this will do it http://jsfiddle.net/2bcp6/2/
[23:26:57] <progrock`> bobbobbins: basic selector.. then .length()
[23:27:26] <progrock`> hendry: ff hand I think $('pre[src=*]')
[23:27:29] <progrock`> I might be slightly off
[23:27:40] <bobbobbins> progrock`, thanks!
[23:28:01] <joshualibrarian> progrock:  and from me as well!  you saved my night!
[23:28:03] <hendry> progrock`: $('pre[src]') seems to work
[23:28:29] <progrock`> hendry: then there you go.. nevr  checked for just the existance of an attriibute, lol.. always checked for acertin value
[23:31:48] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: I fucked up
[23:31:52] <progrock`> I left stop in there
[23:32:00] <hendry> progrock`: http://jsfiddle.net/sSa5X/1/ // not sure why $(this).attr("src") doesn't work
[23:32:21] <progrock`> joshualibrarian: http://jsfiddle.net/2bcp6/3/   now all you need to do is make sure position is always within the bounds... that should be easy for you
[23:32:52] <progrock`> hendry: this is not what you think it is there
[23:33:00] <joshualibrarian> progrock:  yes, indeed!  :)
[23:33:01] <progrock`> this === window
[23:33:44] <hendry> progrock`: oh, so how do I do this?
[23:34:15] <progrock`> http://jsfiddle.net/sSa5X/2/
[23:34:38] <hendry> progrock`: ah, thanks, an .each
[23:35:04] <progrock`> well, you should do some ready on functins, scope, and 'this'
[23:35:10] <progrock`> reading*
[23:35:23] <progrock`> god I hat e the fucking document ready shorthand, lol
[23:39:24] <hendry> I'm using a $.get to retrieve a Javascript example, however Jquery seems to be evaluating it in the (data) callback. Anyone know how to work around this?
[23:40:57] <john__> aasd
[23:43:23] <progrock`> hendry: what are you retrieving?
[23:43:54] <jheyzee> alaalal
[23:44:12] <jheyzee> shout!!!!!
[23:45:13] <progrock`> hendry ?
[23:47:07] <progrock`> weird, chrome optimizes for loops like for (i =0; i < a.length; i++) as opposed to for(i = a.length; i >0; i--)
[23:47:20] <progrock`> luckily forEach is only like 33% slower... worth it to me, lo
[23:47:56] <progrock`> not as pretty in firefox
[23:48:40] <hendry> progrock`: a js file. I think I need to set the datatype as HTML
[23:49:41] <progrock`> hendry: why are you getting a js file via ajax?
[23:50:09] <hendry> progrock`: yes, and I want to embed it into the PRE tag as an example code
[23:50:14] <hendry> not actually run it
[23:51:18] <progrock`> hendry: mm, text
[23:51:32] <progrock`> dataType: 'text'
[23:57:47] <hendry> progrock`: thanks again :)
[23:58:15] <progrock`> np
[23:58:38] <progrock`> lol, moving up into the big boys, haha.. merging two baby VPSes into one child sized, lol
[23:59:02] <progrock`> given I have quite a few bigger ones... but this is actuall ymy favorite provider
