[01:28:39] <TheJHNZ> Is there a way to keep enable click() on appended elements ?
[01:29:25] <slax0r> take a look at .on
[01:29:33] <slax0r> if you use an older jquery take a look at .live
[01:29:37] <xKraty> $('.parent').on('click', '.element', callback);
[01:29:40] <slax0r> and take a look at an update ;)
[01:31:24] <TheJHNZ> if the parent is appended does that matter ?
[01:31:46] <TheJHNZ> like $('post').on('click', 'delete-button');
[01:31:53] <xKraty> yeah the parent must be in page
[01:31:54] <TheJHNZ> and post is appended with delete button
[01:32:00] <xKraty> you have to bind something that exist
[01:32:04] <TheJHNZ> alright
[01:32:18] <xKraty> not cool but you could bind on $(document)
[01:32:31] <TheJHNZ> so i'd have to do like $('posts-container').on('click', 'post delete-button');
[01:32:47] <xKraty> yeah
[01:33:04] <xKraty> as slax0r said is the .live of 2014 lol
[01:33:23] <TheJHNZ> i tried live but i'm using 2.1
[01:33:38] <xKraty> yeah it have been removed
[01:33:40] <TheJHNZ> cool got it working :-)
[01:33:47] <xKraty> cool
[01:34:11] <TheJHNZ> now to go tidy up a api i made which unbinded then binded to solve this issue lol
[01:38:53] <xKraty> lol
[01:52:16] <TheJHNZ> done
[01:52:16] <TheJHNZ> :-)
[01:52:38] <TheJHNZ> now to fix ipad scroll for infinate scroll :C
[02:14:23] <krambiorix> hi, what am i doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/Fsj5z/
[02:14:52] <rooty_> everything unfortunately krambiorix
[02:15:07] <krambiorix> rooty_, ow?
[02:18:21] <krambiorix> rooty_, can you elaborate?
[02:19:51] <krambiorix> anyone else?
[02:21:18] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/Fsj5z/1/
[02:21:25] <Cork> and no not everything
[02:22:04] <Cork> krambiorix: tooltip is delegated by design
[02:22:48] <Cork> krambiorix: and options isn't a key for init
[02:23:03] <Cork> krambiorix: also careful with trailing commas
[02:24:28] <krambiorix> Cork thanks!
[02:24:31] <le_gars> I have a question regarding data-attributes and ids. We use data-attributes a lot when adressing DOM elements from our js. Don't know why it started like that but Im just curious, it seems kinda strange to do that a lot.
[02:24:38] <krambiorix> Cork, hmm this doesn't work with jquery 1.10?
[02:24:39] <le_gars> And not use id's that is.
[02:25:02] <le_gars> Is there any performance difference between the two?
[02:25:03] <Cork> krambiorix: it does
[02:25:29] <Cork> le_gars: gigantic
[02:25:35] <krambiorix> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/Fsj5z/2/
[02:25:49] <Cork> le_gars: browsers has a hash table where it puts the id for each element that has one
[02:26:06] <Cork> le_gars: meaning it gets really fast lookup (the fastest one you can get)
[02:26:13] <le_gars> Cork: ok
[02:26:21] <Cork> le_gars: while data-id is just an attribute, so the browser has to loop over all elements
[02:26:29] <Cork> grab the attributes for each of them
[02:26:36] <Cork> and then checking if the key exists
[02:26:41] <Cork> and if it does check the value
[02:26:47] <le_gars> So id's is much faster?
[02:26:55] <Cork> so it becomes the second slowes selector you can make
[02:27:17] <Cork> le_gars: it might not matter on small page, but if speed matters it makes a big difference
[02:27:37] <Cork> le_gars: one thing though id="" has to be page globally unique
[02:27:56] <Cork> two elements with the same id="value" is invalid html
[02:28:08] <Cork> while data-id is fine to have the same how many times you want
[02:28:24] <Cork> le_gars: basically use data- if you want to store data
[02:28:36] <Cork> le_gars: use id if you want ot uniquely identify the element
[02:28:45] <Cork> and class if you want to group elements together
[02:29:00] <Cork> (class is just slightly slower then id's)
[02:29:39] <Cork> krambiorix: check the checkbox list under the select box
[02:29:53] <Cork> krambiorix: it is a jsfiddle thing, they don't provide jquery ui for all jquery versions
[02:30:15] <benjick> Hi, what is it called when I scroll past the top and the menu "sticks"?
[02:30:22] <krambiorix> Cork, i don't see the checkbox list
[02:30:32] <Cork> krambiorix: exactly :D
[02:30:37] <Cork> krambiorix: there isn't one on 1.10
[02:30:38] <le_gars> Ok, so if you have several elements that you want to adress from js, how should u go about? Generally it is not advised to use classes in js.
[02:30:58] <benjick> http://www.myberlinconnect.de/en/ like this menu
[02:31:32] <benjick> (not the side menu, but the top)
[02:32:01] <krambiorix> Cork,  ah :-)
[02:32:10] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/wehopemi/1/edit
[02:32:41] <Cork> le_gars: uh no generally it is adviced to USE classes >_>
[02:32:53] <Cork> le_gars: that is exactly why classes exist
[02:33:33] <le_gars> Well generally you want to reserve classes for styling right?
[02:33:38] <Cork> le_gars: i talk about css classes here, not js btw
[02:33:45] <Cork> le_gars: no
[02:33:58] <Cork> you want to add classes to elements to identify them
[02:34:06] <le_gars> thats what Ive learnt :)
[02:34:17] <Cork> nothing prevents you from using them both in css and js
[02:34:31] <Cork> le_gars: then it's time to unlearn
[02:34:36] <Cork> cause it is far from true
[02:35:17] <le_gars> No of course not, just that (maybe that was before) Ive always read that you dont want to use classes in js.
[02:35:36] <le_gars> Yes maybe it is about time to move along then :)
[02:35:50] <le_gars> and learn new ways of thinking
[02:37:09] <Cork> le_gars: it was kinda true back in the late mid 90's
[02:37:10] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks a lot!!
[02:37:21] <Cork> le_gars: when classes wasn't indexed by the browser
[02:37:47] <Cork> le_gars: but since ~2002 classes is about as fast as id's
[02:37:47] <le_gars> Cork: :) thanks, just rub it in my face
[02:37:56] <Cork> le_gars: and actually, i rarely use id's
[02:38:22] <Cork> i manly only use classes, unless i know there won't ever be possible to have more then one of them
[02:38:39] <le_gars> really?
[02:38:44] <Cork> ya
[02:39:06] <Cork> i use classes HEAVILY in pages
[02:39:12] <Cork> and most selector i do is class based
[02:39:21] <lemonsparrow> hi.. is there a way when I click on Ionut Zamfir there should be animated scroll down and focus should be on the picture below? http://cssdeck.com/labs/login-form-3 ?
[02:39:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: you might know
[02:39:59] <lemonsparrow> something like internal anchros
[02:40:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: not doable with css animations if that is the question
[02:40:15] <Cork> it's quite simple with js though
[02:40:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: jquery ?
[02:40:46] <Cork> ?g jquery.scrollto
[02:40:47] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ScrollTo â†’ http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[02:41:07] <SprkDev> Does anyone know how to use bootstrap modal to load another page but only include a certain div from that page? I checked this but I still can't get it to work http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12167177/load-a-page-fragment-into-a-twitter-bootstrap-modal
[02:41:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: but ya you can do it with .animate({ scrollTop: 'value' })
[02:41:21] <le_gars> ok.
[02:41:50] <le_gars> Cork: thanks a lot you have given me something to think about and talk to my colleagues about cheers
[02:42:19] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/RuP6KprT
[02:42:23] <Cork> le_gars: btw one exception for the rarely id thing
[02:42:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I want scroll down
[02:42:37] <Cork> le_gars: i have unique id's on every form element i ever add
[02:42:48] <Cork> lemonsparrow: yes, both does that
[02:42:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[02:43:08] <le_gars> ok, yes I do that as well.
[02:43:45] <Cork> even if that means adding incremental numbers to the id for repeated elements
[02:44:08] <Cork> but that is cause html wants it for label to work without nexting the field in it
[02:44:31] <phryk> Anyone here know how to get proper umlauts with select2? They are getting substituted for 'ae' etcâ€¦ :/
[02:44:35] <krambiorix> Cork, i don't get it to work here, local... Where can i put logging to see what's going wrong?
[02:44:50] <krambiorix> Cork, or how can i debug it?
[02:45:31] <Cork> krambiorix: the first selector should be a constant parent that holds all the elements that should trigger tooltips
[02:45:44] <Cork> krambiorix: items: should be a selector that matches the target elements
[02:46:06] <Cork> krambiorix: after that you should get content called when the element is hovered
[02:46:53] <krambiorix> Cork , yes... I try to put some console.logs in the content function but can't see anything appearing in firebug
[02:47:17] <Cork> krambiorix: and you wrapped the code in ready?
[02:49:22] <Cork> phryk: umlaut? you mean auml? or uml?
[02:49:26] <krambiorix> Cork, yes
[02:49:37] <Cork> phryk: don't think there is a umlaut
[02:49:38] <phryk> Cork: Ã¶.Ã¤. etc
[02:50:10] <Cork> phryk: sounds strange if the lib would fiddle with html entities
[02:50:20] <Cork> phryk: tried writing &amul; or similar?
[02:50:38] <phryk> Nah, it's utf-8 encoded xhtml
[02:51:00] <Cork> make sure the file is written in utf8
[02:51:08] <Cork> it's about the only thing i can think of
[02:51:41] <krambiorix> Cork, can i check if the tooltip is bound to the element?
[02:51:43] <phryk> Cork: It works perfectly if i disable js. the output is done by drupal, so I'm pretty sure it's really utf-8 and defines that in the headers and with a <meta> element
[02:51:58] <Cork> krambiorix: it isn't bound to the element, it is bound to the parent
[02:52:14] <Cork> krambiorix: and all you should need there is to check if the selector you use finds the element
[02:52:20] <Cork> $('selector').length
[02:52:48] <Cork> phryk: the php file might not be saved in utf8
[02:52:58] <Cork> phryk: and that could mess things up
[02:53:04] <Cork> pr the js, same thing
[02:53:11] <krambiorix> Cork, i should check when hovering the element? But how?
[02:53:27] <Cork> krambiorix: no no
[02:53:32] <phryk> Cork: that still wouldn't explain why it works perfectly without select2 fiddling around with the values.
[02:53:35] <Cork> when you bind the tooltip
[02:53:42] <Cork> the selector you use on the left of it
[02:53:55] <Cork> that element needs to exist and be a parent of the elements you want to have the tooltip
[02:54:10] <hxm> hello, i am trying to make a chrome extension and i create a div, then using chrome.extension.getURL i load the html code in an iframe, but when i try to send values to the iframe i receive this:  Failed to read the 'contentDocument' property from 'HTMLIFrameElement': Blocked a frame with origin
[02:54:13] <Cork> phryk: if the js is saved in ascii i think that could mess things up
[02:54:14] <krambiorix> Cork, that is document? $(document).tooltip({
[02:54:19] <Cork> hmm
[02:54:21] <hxm> is that possible to load the html content in a div without using iframes?
[02:54:22] <Cork> so not that
[02:54:25] <Cork> krambiorix: you have a link?
[02:54:40] <Cork> hxm: sure, if the target is on your domain
[02:54:47] <krambiorix> Cork, http://pastebin.com/J4YL6eGE
[02:54:52] <Cork> bug Blocked a frame with origin indicates it isn't
[02:54:57] <Cork> *but
[02:55:11] <Cork> hxm: you can't access content from other pages
[02:55:20] <Cork> hxm: that would be a security problem
[02:55:24] <phryk> Cork: Mhh, okay that could be. I'll just check the encoding of the html output, the js, etc. and see if i find any discrepanciesâ€¦
[02:55:43] <hxm> but it is a plugin for my webbrowser, i guess that is considered as risky too
[02:55:47] <Cork> phryk: not saying it is, just hunting for ideas
[02:56:05] <Cork> hxm: then your plugin runs in content scope
[02:56:15] <phryk> Cork: Yeah, but I have a hunch that it's actually a problem with select2 :(
[02:56:16] <Cork> hxm: move the code into priviliged/chrome code
[02:56:29] <hxm> hm ok
[02:56:33] <Cork> phryk: unless they explicitly include a list of html entities
[02:56:43] <Cork> phryk: and .replace() them
[02:56:44] <Cork> no
[02:56:55] <Cork> js doesn't have a method to convert html entities
[02:58:19] <phryk> Cork: the umlauts aren't entities.
[02:58:31] <Cork> phryk: they are
[02:59:33] <phryk> Cork: Yes, because everyone is using utf-8 just for shit and giggles and really encodes every single char as entityâ€¦
[02:59:49] <Cork> ah right sorry
[02:59:58] <Cork> i forgot you said you didn't use that
[02:59:59] <phryk> :P
[03:00:22] <Cork> and then it makes even less sense
[03:00:31] <phryk> That's what unicode is forâ€¦ But yeah, I'd say that if they were entities, select2 probably wouldn't meddle with themâ€¦
[03:00:37] <Cork> cause js is unicode by default
[03:00:43] <Cork> hmm
[03:00:48] <Cork> i guess they could be using regex
[03:00:54] <Cork> something like [a-z]
[03:01:21] <krambiorix> Cork, http://pastebin.com/J4YL6eGE ->that's what i try now
[03:01:31] <Cork> phryk: the problem is that it's actually kinda hard to make it break like this
[03:01:36] <phryk> But the drupal form api afaik doesn't support using entities, it'll just go from &uml; to &amp;uml; :/
[03:01:43] <Cork> krambiorix: by link i meant a live link
[03:01:58] <Cork> krambiorix: i've already seen the code, and i've made it work in the jsbin link
[03:02:03] <Cork> so that isn't the problem
[03:02:22] <krambiorix> Cork, no live link :s
[03:02:40] <Cork> krambiorix: then you will have to check things you self
[03:02:50] <Cork> krambiorix: check that nothing errors out
[03:03:05] <Cork> and that the items: selector actually matches those elements
[03:03:08] <krambiorix> Cork, unfortunately no errors :s
[03:03:12] <phryk> Ah, the javascript file actually IS ascii (came like that out of the repo)â€¦ I hope this'll fix itâ€¦
[03:03:12] <Cork> and nothing is covering them
[03:11:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I wne through the scrollTo api but I found it a lil confusing... my scenario is simple.. I have an anchor tag... on click I want it to scroll to an element with id="xxx" ?
[03:12:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: also will http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js this suffice or is there some other js library I need to include ?
[03:13:13] <Cork> $(document.body).scrollTop(elm)
[03:13:22] <Cork> (i think haven't used the plugin for a while)
[03:13:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is it a plugin ?
[03:13:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js wouldn't do ?
[03:14:15] <Cork> lemonsparrow: scrollTo isn't part of jquery no
[03:14:39] <lemonsparrow> Cork: scrollTop ?
[03:14:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: if you don't want to use the plugin you need to use .animate({ scrollTop: <px offset> });
[03:15:04] <Cork> but then you need to grab the position of the element you want to scroll to,
[03:15:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so how would the code be like <a href="" >something</a> on click should scroll to id="xx"
[03:17:25] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to grab the target element
[03:17:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I said id="xx" for element
[03:18:01] <Cork> and grab its position().top
[03:18:12] <Cork> and then you give that value to animate
[03:19:43] <lemonsparrow> ok
[03:20:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u mean $("#credits").position().top ?
[03:20:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: TypeError: Object #<HTMLHRElement> has no method 'position'
[03:24:14] <HelperW> What is the version I best use for my website?
[03:24:23] <HelperW> jquery 1.10.1 ? or 1.9? or 2(beta)?
[03:28:47] <hxm> how to read the text of a <a href inside of a <div>?
[03:29:01] <hxm> $("#div").attr('a').val ?
[03:30:47] <hxm> ah, find()
[03:39:37] <Cork> hxm: well no .text()
[03:39:49] <Cork> $("#div a').text()
[03:40:08] <hxm> yes, found it, thanks
[03:41:30] <Tomashe> hey guys i wondering what is better. on phonegap with jquery. i wondering if to create a varible with html and then assign it it like that $(".footer").html(myvar); OR i should just put it on the dom from the biginning (i have like 10 footer places)
[03:42:09] <Rashad> Hello.
[03:42:29] <Cork> Tomashe: that is prob better asked in a phonegap channel
[03:43:09] <Rashad> I have a label element wrapping an input element like this: <label id="someID"><input .... > MyLabel </label>
[03:43:31] <Tomashe> k
[03:43:32] <Rashad> I want to change the text "MyLabel" to something else, but without deleting the input element.
[03:43:51] <Cork> Rashad: move the input out of the label
[03:44:02] <Cork> and then just change the label content
[03:44:16] <Cork> Rashad: dom doesn't provide good ways to handle text mixed with elements
[03:44:42] <Cork> you can but you need to drop down to dom nodes and check for nodes that are text nodes
[03:45:07] <Cork> Rashad: it is normally simpler and cleaner to just have the text in an element
[03:45:23] <Rashad> Well I would like to keep the input inside the label because it allows the user to click on the label as if he clicked on the input (a radio button)
[03:46:37] <Rashad> I guess I will include the input element in my rewrite statement
[03:47:03] <Cork> Rashad: just do <label for="id"></label> <input id="id">
[03:47:09] <Cork> and the click works just fine
[03:49:23] <Rashad> That will make the label unclickable.
[03:50:53] <Cork> no
[03:54:36] <Rashad> if the label wraps around a radio button input, clicking it has the same effect as clicking the radio button.
[03:54:43] <Rashad> I want to keep this feature.
[03:54:53] <Cork> Rashad: http://jsfiddle.net/7q74f/
[03:55:10] <Rashad> Now I have figured out that instead of rewriting MyLabel I can just append something to it.
[04:07:05] <Cork> Rashad: yes, and same happens if you use the for attribute
[04:08:41] <SprkDev> I'm having difficult getting the right url into the modal href link. The modal works but since it is in a loop it is acting funny.
[04:08:46] <SprkDev> like giving me the last video
[04:08:54] <Cork> Rashad: http://jsfiddle.net/7q74f/1/
[04:08:55] <SprkDev> or the first depending on where I put the script
[04:09:04] <SprkDev> its wordpress permalink
[04:09:20] <SprkDev> also funnily it loops thru
[04:09:26] <Tomashe> how Memoization is diffrent from just var x = myFunction();
[04:09:48] <Cork> Memoization?
[04:09:54] <Tomashe> yes
[04:09:56] <Cork> what's that?
[04:10:00] <Tomashe> hmm
[04:10:16] <Tomashe> google it
[04:10:20] <Tomashe> its better
[04:10:30] <Rashad> Cork: Ah I see! thanks
[04:11:00] <Cork> Tomashe: so a function that returns a function
[04:11:04] <Cork> *function
[04:11:22] <Cork> Tomashe: the outer function can keep a variable that says cross function calls
[04:11:30] <Cork> without the variable being global
[04:12:00] <Tomashe> hmm
[04:12:22] <Tomashe> hows is that working
[04:12:31] <Cork> scope inheritance
[04:12:56] <Tomashe> ok i see
[04:13:21] <Cork> js> function a() { var i = 0; return function() { return ++i; } }; var b = a(); print(JSON.stringify([b(),b(),b(),b()]));
[04:13:27] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:13:32] <Cork> <_<
[04:13:47] <Cork> man.. that bot is a big joke...
[04:14:01] <Cork> function a() { var i = 0; return function() { return ++i; } }; var b = a(); print(JSON.stringify([b(),b(),b(),b()]));
[04:14:02] <Cork> "[1,2,3,4]"
[04:16:40] <SprkDev> question:if I'm using modal bootstrap and loading another page (permalink()) and this is for a list of items, how can I make sure that the correct link is giving only once and not looping to the end?
[04:18:39] <Cork> HelperW: have you found your answer?
[04:24:45] <HelperW> Cork I am now using : 1.10.1.min.js
[04:24:58] <Cork> HelperW: to answer the question
[04:25:15] <Cork> 2.x if you don't need ie8 or older support
[04:25:24] <Cork> 1.9+ if you need it
[04:25:42] <HelperW> I need IE8 support.
[04:25:47] <HelperW> Ok.
[04:25:50] <Cork> as for the release number after that; try to stay on the latest stable release
[04:25:53] <HelperW> No IE7 support needed.
[04:26:14] <Cork> so that would be 1.11
[04:27:26] <HelperW> Ok! :) Thanks for the support Cork.
[04:27:39] <Cork> np
[04:28:18] <jeremib> is there a way to attach an event to when a div is shown/hidden?
[04:28:51] <Cork> jeremib: yes you can
[04:29:05] <Cork> but you should prob just check if the element is visible in a static click handler
[04:30:07] <jeremib> There are multiple ways this div can be hidden, so I want to make sure I take care of all entry points.
[04:30:20] <jeremib> even ones I may not know about
[04:30:30] <Cork> jeremib: it is messy to add and remove event listeners all the time
[04:30:36] <Cork> jeremib: but ya it is possible
[04:30:56] <Cork> just attach the event listener in show and remove it in hide
[04:31:09] <Cork> .on() and .off()
[04:31:42] <Cork> $(this).on('click', function() {}); $(this).off('click');
[04:33:33] <jeremib> what i was thinking was more of $('#myDiv').on('hide', function() { //do cleanup });
[04:33:49] <Cork> there is no hide event
[04:33:59] <jeremib> or a way to knwo when the element may have been shown/hidden and then check if it's hidden
[04:34:15] <Cork> you would have to use the callbacks from the animation
[04:39:18] <jeremib> thanks Cork

[04:55:54] <steevenz> hi all
[04:56:01] <steevenz> is anyone can help with datatables
[04:57:03] <steevenz> hellow
[04:57:43] <mogaj> How to access form $_POST values in jquery when form submitted by PHP?
[04:59:14] <steevenz> i think it's must be inline at the jquery script..
[04:59:40] <steevenz> maybe you can do echo at the jquery script..
[05:00:27] <steevenz> like var $post = [<?php echo implode(',',$_POST); ?>];
[05:01:31] <steevenz> is anyone can help me with jquery datatables?
[05:02:48] <Cork> mogaj: you can't
[05:03:03] <Cork> mogaj: $_POST is server side
[05:03:20] <Cork> mogaj: there is a few ways you can get the data from server side to client side
[05:03:33] <Cork> either storing it in js, or as data- attributes on an element
[05:03:43] <Cork> or as <input type="hidden">
[05:04:02] <Cork> mogaj: but you have to send the data to the client for js to have access to it
[05:06:15] <steevenz> @Cork: can u help me with datatables?
[05:06:42] <Cork> steevenz: only if it is js generic questions
[05:06:46] <Cork> never used the plugin
[05:07:03] <steevenz> oo ic..
[05:07:28] <steevenz> is anyone have used the plugin?
[05:12:44] <b0bi> Hi, If I have a combobox with the following options: a,b,c,d , and I want to get the value of the last option (without knowing it's name or value, i only know its the last one) how can I retrieve it?
[05:17:27] <Cork> b0bi: $('select option').last().val()
[05:17:58] <Guest86101> hi http://jsfiddle.net/rhYeP/1/ works properly on mouseenter but not on mouse leave
[05:18:05] <Guest86101> can anyone please help?
[05:18:18] <puebloA> if a dblclick a <td> inside a <tr> how can i get the values of all the <td>s' inside that <tr>?
[05:19:11] <Guest86101> its doesn't gradually fade out on mouseleave
[05:20:13] <Cork> Guest86101: you animate argument are wrong
[05:20:14] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/rhYeP/2/
[05:25:25] <b0bi> Cork: thanks
[05:25:28] <Cork> puebloA: $(this).siblings()
[05:25:46] <SprkDev> what is the javascript equilavent of print_r?
[05:25:59] <puebloA> thanks!
[05:26:12] <Cork> SprkDev: there isn't really one
[05:26:25] <Cork> SprkDev: you normally just inspect the variable in the console instead
[05:27:07] <Cork> SprkDev: meaning console.log(variable)
[05:33:57] <dwarder> in handlebars within each block , how do i access parent level value?
[05:34:10] <dwarder> {{../parent_level_value}} ?
[05:34:14] <tsun> How to set current date in a dynamically loaded textfield?
[05:34:16] <tsun> $( "#textfield" ).datepicker(pickerOpts).datepicker("setDate", "0"); does not work!
[05:34:38] <ankurk_> tsun: a jsbin or fiddle would help us
[05:34:44] <SprkDev> I having a little trouble with my jquery modal > Cork
[05:34:51] <SprkDev> my modal works fine.
[05:34:57] <SprkDev> I am using wordpress.
[05:36:46] <SprkDev> the problem is the permalink.
[05:36:54] <SprkDev> the permalink function is php
[05:37:14] <SprkDev> which means I get the link and post id after the page loads
[05:37:16] <dwarder> anyone handlebars?
[05:37:34] <SprkDev> which means the wrong post loads into the modal. how do I fix this? :-(
[05:39:26] <Cork> SprkDev: modal?
[05:39:37] <SprkDev> yes
[05:39:39] <Cork> are you talking about jquery ui dialog?
[05:39:49] <SprkDev> the modal works. its the post inside the modal that is the problem
[05:39:52] <SprkDev> its bootstrap
[05:40:17] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/GbpZDeDK
[05:40:45] <SprkDev> I'm trying to use ajax to get the permalink now but not sure is best way
[05:42:17] <Cork> SprkDev: not sure
[05:42:29] <SprkDev> any ideas?
[05:42:54] <Cork> would have to dig into what the modal plugin does
[05:43:20] <Cork> (i normally don't use js for overlays at all)
[05:43:27] <Mariaa> i am not sure if you can just specify an action like this and get the id without explicitly defining an ajax function in functions.php
[05:44:13] <Cork> Mariaa: the script is most likely generated from php
[05:44:17] <Cork> and then it works
[05:44:43] <Mariaa> Cork:  thanks for fade in help but sometimes the mouseleave doesn't fire  like here http://tinyurl.com/nfk27be
[05:45:28] <Mariaa> SprkDev: are you getting the correct id in ajax response?
[05:45:44] <Cork> Mariaa: you want .stop() before each fade call
[05:45:48] <Cork> else you will build a queue
[05:46:38] <puebloA> why haven't i used jquery so long? it's awesome
[05:46:41] <Mariaa> you are right, let me do it that way
[05:46:46] <Mateo_> Hi !
[05:46:54] <Mariaa> puebloA:  start using it now
[05:46:58] <Mariaa> never too late ;)
[05:47:07] <puebloA> that's right
[05:47:34] <Mariaa> Cork:  thanks its perfect now.
[05:48:26] <Mateo_> I have trouble with a selector. I have X ul element, with Y li inside. I would like to select the first of them with a ? inside, but I can't get the right selector to do that. Any idea please?
[05:48:59] <Cork> Mateo_: ? inside
[05:49:06] <Cork> as text in the element you mean?
[05:49:17] <Mateo_> Cork, yep
[05:49:27] <Cork> Mateo_: you shouldn't do that
[05:49:29] <SprkDev> doesn't seem so. here is my function http://pastebin.com/SQBmTZr7
[05:49:54] <Cork> Mateo_: you should set a class on the element instead
[05:50:19] <Cork> Mateo_: the reason content selection is a bad idea is that you can't do it with fast css selectors
[05:50:24] <Cork> you have to loop and check with js
[05:51:59] <SprkDev> how do I put that perm variable inside the modalbody?
[05:52:18] <Mateo_> Cork, oh you're right. So with a class, I could just use $("li.theclass:first") right ?
[05:52:33] <Cork> Mateo_: yes
[05:52:47] <Cork> Mateo_: that would only give you one element though
[05:52:48] <Mateo_> Damn. Sometimes I wonder why I try to complicate things ...
[05:53:08] <Mateo_> Cork, yes, that's what I need. Only the first.
[05:53:11] <Cork> $("li.theclass:first") is a round about way for doing $("li.theclass").first()
[05:56:06] <Hyperking> what is the easiest way to getting the page slug from the url?
[05:56:12] <Mateo_> Thank you Cork !
[05:56:24] <Cork> Mateo_: yw
[05:56:29] <Hyperking> example: foo.com/about-us   jquery = about-us
[05:57:08] <Cork> Hyperking: depends if you want the full path or just the last section
[05:57:20] <Hyperking> cork: just the section
[05:57:42] <Velveeta> window.location.pathname
[05:57:56] <Hyperking> I have a method, but its too verbose
[05:57:58] * Velveeta sticks his hand into the ring and screams out "tag me, Cork!"
[05:58:08] <Cork> Hyperking: window.location.pathname.split('/').pop()
[05:58:29] <Cork> Velveeta: you missed the last part of the question :)
[05:58:41] <Velveeta> yeah i was in the middle of typing out something to ask him to clarify
[05:58:53] <Velveeta> so hyperking, in the example you posted, our answers both work
[05:58:54] <b0bi> Hi, when I use $('select').val(value); it does not update the GUI, is there some function I need to call to make it redraw itself?
[05:58:59] <Hyperking> window.location.href.split('/')[3]
[05:59:22] <Velveeta> so, to clarify, if you have http://www.domainname.com/foo/bar/baz, you only want the 'baz' portion right?
[05:59:24] <Tomashe> Hey guys i was wodering something. im createing mobile app using jqueyrphonegap. at the moment im having a gient html page with all pages inside (99kb file) .  so i gues every search i do on the page take alot of power . so maybe i should use some kind of template machanized to load/remove from page elemets that not visible . what u think?
[05:59:30] <Hyperking> velveeta: thanks, thought I may have doing it incorrectly
[05:59:48] <Cork> Hyperking: no need to include the domain if you only want the slug
[06:00:00] <Hyperking> cork: right
[06:00:19] <Velveeta> b0bi: nope, it should redraw itself automatically
[06:00:48] <Cork> but window.location.pathname.split('/').pop() should always give you the last part of the path
[06:01:28] <b0bi> Velveeta: it doesn't, maybe thats because I use bootstrap or something?
[06:01:33] <Velveeta> tomashe: there are plenty of pages that are heavier than 99k and still responsive to the user.... is it noticeably slow when you do searches of some kind?
[06:02:02] <Velveeta> b0bi: are you using some kind of bootstrap component that masks and prettifies your select element? or is it strictly just a select element?
[06:03:16] <b0bi> Velveeta: afaik, I only use the <select> tag without additional classes, but bootstrap might have modified it.
[06:03:32] <Tomashe> Cork: what u think?
[06:03:44] <Velveeta> b0bi: do you have a link where we can see this in action?
[06:04:21] <Cork> Tomashe: the size of the dom matters more then the size of the html
[06:07:04] <b0bi> Velveeta: it's currently in an internal server, i'll see what I can do.
[06:07:12] <Tomashe> Velveeta: its slows when i load alot of html lists basicly
[06:07:22] <Tomashe> its 99kb when its only the wireframe and basics
[06:07:24] <Velveeta> b0bi: if you can't get us a link to it, if you can recreate the issue on jsbin/jsfiddle, that'd help too
[06:07:28] <Tomashe> after that things loads using ajax
[06:07:37] <Tomashe> and Crok: no i dont have
[06:07:38] <Tomashe> :/
[06:07:47] <Tomashe> its mobileapp . at the moment only on my phone for testing
[06:08:21] <Velveeta> tomashe: then yeah, what cork said is probably gonna be the source of your problem... if you're loading a crap-ton of lists, depending on how you're iterating over them, that could definitely slow things down
[06:08:37] <Velveeta> and yes, i would probably load the lists into memory as json, and use some kind of client-side templating to render the appropriate ones
[06:09:03] <SprkDev> help! :-(
[06:09:04] <Velveeta> and when you do searches against them, search against the in-memory data as opposed to parsing and searching through the dom, and then re-render the dom from the result set
[06:09:05] <Tomashe> that should skyrock preformances?
[06:09:26] <Velveeta> i can't say 'skyrocket' for sure without knowing more details, but it should at least help, yes
[06:09:48] <Tomashe> any good template engine?
[06:09:54] <Velveeta> i use handlebars myself
[06:11:01] <Tomashe> thanks i thought about using that too:)
[06:12:59] <Velveeta> no problem, you can look up various speedtests of it vs other ones on jsperf
[06:13:12] <Velveeta> just do a search for something like "handlebars vs <some other template engine name> jsperf"
[06:26:20] <ankurk_> anyone using Select2 plugin?
[06:26:48] <ankurk_> I just want to know how does select2 set the value?

[06:33:24] <aitiba> hi
[06:33:37] <aitiba> I'm trying to append this to the page
[06:33:47] <aitiba> "<a onclick='alert('pasa')' id='delete_product' data-id='12' >Delete</a>"
[06:34:16] <aitiba> I get a sintax error on "alert(" ¿why? thanks!
[06:34:18] <ankurk_> The thing is I am getting a data of employees, it does select the employee & I can see selected name but not the id of the employee it selects.
[06:34:21] <Cork> aitiba: don't use inline event attributes
[06:34:28] <ankurk_> btw all hail xKraty!
[06:34:33] <Cork> aitiba: move the js out of the html and it should be much simpler
[06:34:43] <xKraty> lol hello
[06:36:47] <ankurk_> sup?
[06:36:58] <aitiba> Cork: I try to do it with events. The events are call is this element is not created on the fly with any client interactions. when you click on any element created on the fly with the user iterations, this events is not called
[06:37:14] <Cork> aitiba: use delegated event listener
[06:37:21] <lemonsparrow> I have this line       $( document ).ready(function() {          $("#tab1").click(function() {             $('#credits').ScrollTo();          });       }); but it doesn't work on clickin the anchor tag <a id="tab1" href="">Mith</a>
[06:37:31] <Cork> lemonsparrow: please don't post the code in the channel
[06:37:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: sorry
[06:38:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://pastebin.com/jq5ptZdw
[06:38:48] <Cork> scrollTo not ScrollTo
[06:38:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: when I execute $('#credits').ScrollTo(); in firebug it works but the click event is not working
[06:39:09] <lemonsparrow> yes $('#credits').ScrollTo(); Cork
[06:39:22] <Cork> its scrollTo not ScrollTo
[06:40:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork: moved document.ready to head tag and it workd
[06:42:01] <hxm> hi
[06:42:08] <hxm> why $ is not a function and $$ yes?
[06:42:28] <Cork> hxm: sounds like you have something other then jquery loaded
[06:42:36] <Cork> like ex prototype
[06:43:10] <hxm> oh, ah, i guess the main project uses it then
[06:43:38] <Cork> ?api noConflict
[06:43:38] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:43:43] <Cork> ?api jQuery.noConflict
[06:43:43] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.noConflict(): Relinquish jQuery's control of the <code>$</code> variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[06:44:05] <Cork> that might be how they are doing it already though
[06:46:44] <hxm> jQuery is always the best way to call jquery right?
[06:47:00] <Cork> if you can't use $ ya
[06:47:13] <Cork> you can redefine $ for you code if you like though
[06:47:28] <Cork> something like jQuery(function($) {});
[06:47:39] <Cork> if the code is to be in a ready wrapper
[06:47:51] <DeltaHeavy> Is there a preferred way to toggle a class like .active to elements throught a whole site with a single event? This is what I got so far - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/auFbL/
[06:47:54] <Cork> or (function($) {})(jQuery); if it doens't
[06:48:02] <DeltaHeavy> It works but I don't like having query selectors in my HTML
[06:50:18] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/cJrks/
[06:50:38] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: or you could just have the same class on all of those elements
[06:51:12] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: (point is you don't need all that if logic)
[06:51:35] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: I'm not using toggleClass() in case 2 seperate events are fired without removing '.active' to lets say .overlay
[06:51:48] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: no
[06:51:58] <DeltaHeavy> But besides that, is what I'm doing here alright, or is it not suggested to have a single event to handle all instances of applying/removing a class like .active?
[06:52:05] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: the second argument to toggle handles that
[06:52:37] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: i would prob add a wrapper around the section
[06:52:43] <Cork> and have it group the elements together
[06:52:50] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Really? I'll take a look into that. Thanks!
[06:52:58] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Problem about a wrapper is elements like .overlay
[06:53:10] <Cork> and then do $(this).closet('.wrapper').find('.collapse').toggleClass()
[06:53:32] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: i mean i would have one around all the related content
[06:56:42] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: But again, .overlay is a direct child of <body>. I don't want to apply it to that then EVERYTHING is active.
[06:57:25] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: and you can't add an additional wrapper around both those elements?
[06:58:31] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Nope. It would have to be the whole page at that point
[06:58:37] <DeltaHeavy> The .overlay is a global eleemnt used for all sorts of things.
[06:58:41] <Cork> hmm
[06:58:47] <DeltaHeavy> Feel free to critisize anything I'm doing. It's welcomed.
[06:58:52] <DeltaHeavy> Do you understand what I'm trying to do here though?
[06:59:03] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: not much alternatives to what you do then
[06:59:07] <Cork> it is about the best you can do
[06:59:11] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/auFbL/
[06:59:22] <SprkDev> is there a way to use ajax to get clicked url and assign it to a link?
[06:59:28] <Cork> ah
[06:59:39] <DeltaHeavy> Is this generaly done at all? How do people normally apply/remove classes like .active? Do they use a whole bunch of events?
[07:00:00] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: apply active isn't the problem
[07:00:11] <Cork> it is how to find the elements you want to apply "something" on
[07:00:21] <DeltaHeavy> Exactly =/
[07:00:29] <DeltaHeavy> Like, this works but it seems kinda janky
[07:00:41] <Cork> and if you don't have any dom structure you need something else to bind it on
[07:01:12] <Cork> i usually do $(this).closest('.wrapper')
[07:01:28] <Cork> and for the few exceptions where i have a related element
[07:01:35] <DeltaHeavy> Do you have a molular event you use for all your projects for this sort of stuff?
[07:01:39] <Cork> it is normally at the same level as .wrapper
[07:01:53] <Cork> so i do $(this).closest('.wrapper').prevAll('.something-else').first()
[07:02:12] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: nowdays i always use static event handlers
[07:02:22] <Cork> so they are never added in a loop
[07:02:34] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Not sure what you mean there. Isn't this a static event handler?
[07:02:37] <Cork> so ya, delegated as soon as it is a number of elements affected
[07:02:41] <DeltaHeavy> I'm using .on() as so there's only a single listener.
[07:02:43] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: it is
[07:02:52] <Cork> but if you add it to each element, you do it in a loop
[07:03:13] <Cork> basically i never add multiple event handlers if i can use delegation
[07:03:23] <Cork> i've noticed it helps keeping the code sane
[07:03:44] <Cork> and multiple event handlers can really affect page performance
[07:03:49] <Cork> anyway gtg
[07:03:56] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks for your help!
[07:11:46] <SprkDev> how do I get clicked items (that is in wordpress loop) to give me its post_id using jquery?
[07:12:05] <SprkDev> so click box and get post_id into console.log. how?
[07:12:29] <decx> depends on your wordpress theme
[07:31:37] <noaXess> hello
[07:32:50] <noaXess> i'm trying to make a $.ajax call to a php script, which sends back a status reponse as json.. on each status update i want update any element on success... $.ajax will be calle din a loop... for (...){ $.ajax... $elm.html(status) }
[07:33:02] <noaXess> but i can't get it running.. i just have the first state and the last..
[07:34:23] <noaXess> i just want have a progress/counting
[07:34:52] <DeltaHeavy> Can somebody give me a hand with a rather simple jQuery thingy? Trying to make a single event for applying the class .active to specific elements rather than having a bunch of individual events apply it for different cases. As is I'm storing a query selector in the data-active attribute to indicate what elements I ALSO want .active toggled, and sometimes these elements can be a direct child of <body>. Does anybody have any better solution/c
[07:34:52] <DeltaHeavy> ritisism? - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LkHbr/
[07:35:42] <noaXess> btw. i see the each response in console.log
[07:36:14] <steevenz> hi all is anyone has been using datatables plugin?
[07:37:00] <krambiorix> i have a table with 4 cols ... the combination of 2 fields should be unique ... How can i do that?
[07:37:29] <tsun> why is following not working when the input is dynamically loaded? http://jsfiddle.net/3LAJz/
[07:37:47] <decx> DeltaHeavy if you want to select direct children of body you have to use filter instead of find
[07:38:07] <decx> as they are in a flat hierarchy
[07:38:17] <DeltaHeavy> decx: That's not what I want to do though. I'm just using delegation so I can apply this event to multiple elements
[07:38:51] <decx> ah ok, the find/filter thing is the most common problem so i just shot in the dark :>
[07:39:37] <decx> maybe set up a fiddle, i can't actually grasp what you want. but maybe thats because i havent eaten anything today yet
[07:39:54] <steevenz> need help.. on datatables
[07:40:05] <steevenz> anyone can help me? please...
[07:40:25] <decx> just ask your question and hope that somebody knows and cares enough
[07:40:25] <SprkDev> how do I add a javascript string to jquery? I want the value in the variable to be used. http://pastebin.com/s6yvct0H line 33
[07:41:05] <steevenz> how to build custom filtering request
[07:41:12] <Cork> SprkDev: taht line is used
[07:41:25] <Cork> SprkDev: the element might not exist yet though
[07:41:26] <steevenz> cause i build my own filtering form
[07:41:31] <SprkDev> so I've done it correctly?
[07:41:38] <Cork> steevenz: filtering?
[07:41:44] <Cork> like user input?
[07:42:07] <steevenz> search table accross server side
[07:42:26] <Cork> ah, datatable
[07:42:27] <steevenz> ya it's the filtering form like user input
[07:42:43] <steevenz> it's very confiusing
[07:42:48] <Cork> SprkDev: the selector is valid, can't say much more
[07:43:49] <djoanes_> Hey, do you guys know if there's a way to have a group summary in jquery datatables?
[07:44:23] <krambiorix> how can i get all input fields with the value FOO ?
[07:45:44] <steevenz> djoanes_: what kind of grouping summary? is there any example?
[07:46:24] <Cork> krambiorix: you would have to loop all elements and check there current value
[07:46:43] <krambiorix> Cork, i was afraid of that :s
[07:46:45] <Cork> krambiorix: css doesn't have access to what the state of the value of an input field
[07:46:54] <Cork> krambiorix: it isn't super bad
[07:47:12] <Cork> $('input').filter(function() { return this.value == 'FOO'; })
[07:47:36] <krambiorix> Cork, i thought to check for the modified row and check if there is another row with those 2 field's values ?
[07:47:38] <Cork> krambiorix: but ya, you don't want to run it too often
[07:47:51] <krambiorix> Cork, max 10 rows in the table
[07:48:22] <Cork> krambiorix: i mean rather onscroll or onkeydown or something like that
[07:48:31] <Cork> cause the selector is costly
[07:48:40] <krambiorix> Cork, on change?
[07:48:45] <djoanes_> steevenz: yeah sec
[07:48:50] <Cork> krambiorix: on an input?
[07:48:53] <krambiorix> Cork, yes
[07:48:57] <Cork> krambiorix: that should be quire rare
[07:49:06] <Cork> so ya, should be fine
[07:49:13] <krambiorix> Cork wait i'll make an example
[07:49:14] <Cork> krambiorix: try to limit the selector for input
[07:49:24] <Cork> krambiorix: possibly even cache it in a variable cross events
[07:49:36] <djoanes_> steevenz: http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html
[07:49:40] <djoanes_> grouping with summary
[07:49:44] <Cork> that way it should be fairly ok in speed
[07:50:35] <krambiorix> Cork, http://pastebin.com/3aVr63TV
[07:51:24] <Cork> krambiorix: like i just said keep a jquery selector cross the events and even keydown should be ok
[07:51:28] <DeltaHeavy> decx: Sorry, if I'm not pinged I often totally forget I'm having a conversation :p One moment
[07:52:05] <krambiorix> Cork, ok thanks
[07:57:12] <IamTrying> Need to clear concept. What is <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Cmopatible" content="requiresActiveX=true,IE=edge...,chrome=1" /> here what does this mean?
[07:57:51] <IamTrying> What should browser Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox do on this value when they will parse it and try to render it.
[08:00:12] <Cork> iamntz: IE=edge means ie should never go into legacy mode
[08:00:27] <Cork> requiresActiveX is not something i know
[08:00:42] <Cork> chrome=1 is a chrome thing, din't remember what it was though
[08:00:44] <IamTrying> Cork, edge, chrome 1 is clear, but requiresActiveX = true i am confused
[08:00:48] <Cork> firefox doesn't use that meta at all
[08:01:05] <IamTrying> Cork, chrome=1 = Google Chrome frame to allow
[08:01:14] <Cork> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh920753%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[08:01:22] <Cork> IamTrying: right
[08:01:32] <decx> just a bunch of feelgood elements to beg ie to do stuff right. mostly wishful thinking
[08:01:37] <Cork> i have it on a site, but we kinda stopped supporting ie6 so no an issue anymore
[08:01:48] <Cork> lol
[08:02:13] <drej> what? why would you stop supporting IE6 ?
[08:02:15] <drej> thats so dumb
[08:02:17] <Cork> IamTrying: oh, right safari and opera doesn't use it either
[08:02:23] <drej> how will north korea visit your site now?
[08:02:27] <IamTrying> Cork, Right :)
[08:02:28] <Cork> drej: ya, the future of the net :)
[08:02:36] <NoiseEee> more like China tbh
[08:02:48] <IamTrying> thank you for the link Cork , there its well written what the hell is requiresActiveX=true mean
[08:02:52] <drej> north korea is still IE4, you're right
[08:03:00] <drej> i mean, the parts that have electricity
[08:03:22] <decx> i bet kim jong il has firefox
[08:03:37] <drej> he strikes me as an Opera person
[08:03:54] <drej> totalitarian, full of himself, huge ego
[08:03:55] <drej> == opera
[08:04:20] <decx> he's compiling his own then
[08:04:26] <decx> always bleeding edge with the newest blink
[08:05:09] <decx> his secretary has to use maxthon :(
[08:13:39] <sam452> Trying to troubleshoot a jQuery append() issue to a Rails 4 form. In Chrome's console my append is in quotes while rest of form is not.
[08:13:57] <sam452> ('form').append("< input type='hidden' name='score[page]' value='"+ tp_id +"'>");
[08:14:32] <fabioportieri> sam452: ("<input not < input
[08:15:09] <sam452> Sorry, pasted wrong thing. Here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sam452/pWrg3/4/
[08:15:30] <dave_s>  Has anyone used a decent, open source support ticket system with AD integration?
[08:15:44] <sam452> 	$('form').append("< input type='hidden' name='score[page]' value='"+ tp_id +"'>");
[08:16:04] <DeltaHeavy> Is using 'document' for event delegation the best way to go about delegating an event for an entire document? eg: $(document).on('click', '.toggle-active', function () {
[08:16:37] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy depends
[08:17:01] <BinaryKitten> personally i prefer to delegate closer to the change points
[08:17:24] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: I was using $('body') before but I was told it's not supported by all browsers. I was told to use $('html, body') but that fires the event twice.
[08:17:44] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: I do that too, but this is an event that may even be triggered by direct children of the body element.
[08:18:03] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy are you updating the whole document?
[08:19:16] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: It's an event that's going to be WIDELY used, from things deep in the DOM to things directly below the body. Here's the whole thing - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LkHbr/
[08:19:41] <DeltaHeavy> (If you can suggest a better way to do what I'm doing in general it would be MUCH appreciated but I've been talking ot people all morning about it :p)
[08:20:10] <BinaryKitten> rght DeltaHeavy
[08:20:24] <BinaryKitten> but DeltaHeavy are you updating the page contents using JS
[08:20:59] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: Yes, only toggling a class really.
[08:21:25] <BinaryKitten> ah by update i mean .. insert new content, replace the content with other content
[08:22:42] <DeltaHeavy> Nope, I'm just trying to make a general purpose function for toggling the class .active on specific elements.
[08:22:56] <BinaryKitten> ah ok
[08:23:05] <BinaryKitten> delegation isn't required then
[08:23:07] <BinaryKitten> give me a moment
[08:24:17] <DeltaHeavy> I thought delegation was good because it would only create one event listening over a variable amount of them. This event is going to be triggered by a whole bunch of elements.
[08:26:13] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy pastebin.com/FuwkuuZH
[08:27:10] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: It works, but I'm confused as to why I should do things this way as opposed to how I had it before?
[08:27:34] <BinaryKitten> since you're not changing the dom, you don't need delegation.
[08:27:52] <BinaryKitten> the each will allow for a single dom search for each target to take place
[08:28:03] <BinaryKitten> rather than a dom search each time a click is handled
[08:28:05] <DeltaHeavy> Also, why are you caching $(this)? I thought the time it took to wrap 'this' around a jQ object was so minute I shouldn't care about it? Are there other reasonings behind it?
[08:28:16] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, I see. That's rather fantastic
[08:28:38] <BinaryKitten> the reason i use the $this is to save typeing
[08:28:41] <BinaryKitten> i'm lazy
[08:28:44] <DeltaHeavy> Also why no '$(document).ready(function() {}); ?
[08:28:53] <DeltaHeavy> I've never seen it done like that before.
[08:29:31] <BinaryKitten> passing a function to jQuery === document.ready
[08:29:52] <BinaryKitten> it also passes itself to the ready function so you can map to $
[08:30:10] <BinaryKitten> meaning it can run easily even if $ is something other than jQuery
[08:30:18] <BinaryKitten> there's a small error there
[08:30:58] <BinaryKitten> if the state of the active class meant to be controlled by the .toggle-active item OR just toggled on/off per click?
[08:36:04] <SprkDev> I need to call this function through javascript function because I've had problem with php post id.
[08:36:17] <sam452> In Chrome's console when I append() an input type, the output object is the form with my input in quotes. Could that be why this value is ignored in POST?
[08:36:37] <Velveeta> i don't know if i follow the question..
[08:37:07] <SprkDev> is it possible to link boostrap modal to a javascript function and not use the data-target a href link directly?
[08:37:17] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: Sorry one moment
[08:37:19] <sam452> Chrome shows the form in colored notation to indicate its objects. But my append is showing up in quotes.
[08:37:50] <sam452> This value in my append() is not being passed. I think because it's in quotes is why.
[08:37:51] <Velveeta> sam452: can you show us a jsbin/jsfiddle example of what you're trying to do when you append that input?
[08:38:10] <sam452> yes http://jsfiddle.net/sam452/pWrg3/4/
[08:39:10] <sam452> For some reason, it's passed as a string and not a form object, it appears.
[08:40:36] <SprkDev> can some please help me adapt this to the code please?
[08:41:39] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: .toggle-active is to indicate what's responsible for fireing the event. It see's if hat has 'active' or not so it knows whether to apply/remove active for all other elements involved. Does that make sense?
[08:41:55] <DeltaHeavy> If you (or anybody) thinks I can accomplish this task in general any better it's appreciated.
[08:42:24] <Velveeta> sam452: you have a space between your opening angle bracket and the word 'input', and it's being interpreted as invalid markup
[08:42:25] <DeltaHeavy> Kinda surprized using that jQuery(function($){ stuff breaks my syntax highlighting in Sublime Text =/
[08:42:35] <BinaryKitten> heh
[08:42:40] <BinaryKitten> use a proper IDE :p
[08:42:51] <Velveeta> sublime is an awesome ide :D
[08:43:11] <Velveeta> well, maybe i should rephrase that, sublime is an awesome *text editor*
[08:43:15] <BinaryKitten> it's an awesome text editor :)
[08:43:26] <DeltaHeavy> Its a plugin doing the syntax highlighting.
[08:43:45] <Velveeta> right, it has some intellisense plugins and whatnot also, that make it more like a lightweight ide
[08:43:46] <sam452> Yes, it does look better in Chrome now, Velveeta: thx
[08:43:52] <Velveeta> sam452: no problemo
[08:44:38] <SprkDev> I'm not using the a href data-toggle part. I need to match the parameters to work with the function though http://pastebin.com/NYauyw6k
[08:44:45] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: Any reason why people don't use 'jQuery(function ($) {' more? This is the first time I'm seeing it.
[08:44:55] <Velveeta> sprkdev: i don't use bootstrap myself, but i can try taking a look under the hood of its modal widget and see if i can figure something out for you
[08:44:58] <DeltaHeavy> Solves a lot of conflict issues I'd imagine.
[08:45:07] <BinaryKitten> usually see $(function() {
[08:45:10] <tsun> why is following not working when the input is dynamically loaded? http://jsfiddle.net/3LAJz/
[08:45:25] <BinaryKitten> $ == jQuery most of the time
[08:45:29] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: Not $(document).ready(function () {? That's what I ALWAYS see.
[08:45:30] <decx> because it's really only relevant if you know somebody might use $ somewhere else
[08:45:32] <BinaryKitten> but i prefer to make damn well sure
[08:45:52] <Velveeta> i don't typically use jQuery(function($) only because i typically wrap all of my code in a closure that manually passes in jQuery and receives it as $, and hosts my code + document.ready
[08:46:08] <SprkDev> I'd appreciate that help.
[08:46:21] <Velveeta> (function($) { /*stuff here*/ $(function(){}); }(jQuery));
[08:46:44] <BinaryKitten> Velveeta actually that's a little bit overboard
[08:46:45] <Velveeta> i wasn't even actually aware that it received a jQuery reference as a parameter
[08:46:49] <SprkDev> check the pastebin link. I need to replace e.currentTarget with the paremeter sent to the function instead. But how?
[08:47:11] <BinaryKitten> Velveeta yeah, this is why i've stopped doing IIFE when i only need document ready
[08:47:12] <Velveeta> binarykitten: not if you have other functions set up that use jquery internally, and you want to keep from polluting the global scope
[08:47:20] <SprkDev> this function call <a onClick="javascript: loadXMLDoc_single_popup2('modal_<?php the_ID(); ?>', '<?php the_ID(); ?>', '<?php echo $permlink; ?>'); return false;" href="<?php echo get_permalink(); ?>" > 	
[08:47:29] <DeltaHeavy> I'm inclined to still use '$(document).ready(function () {' soley because my syntax highlighting sitll works and I KNOW it won't conflict in this project.
[08:47:40] <DeltaHeavy> But that way sounds a lot more sexier.
[08:48:07] <BinaryKitten> Velveeta i mean jQuery(function($) { ....... }); is no less polutant than (function($) { $(function() { ... }); })(jQuery);
[08:48:10] <decx> shouldnt make a difference for syntax highlighting
[08:48:27] <DeltaHeavy> decx: This plugin probably sucks =/
[08:48:29] <BinaryKitten> only time i use the IIFE is when i'm writing jQuery plugins
[08:48:40] <Velveeta> binarykitten: right, but only for your document.ready stuff... i nest all of my function declarations inside one IIFE block like that also, to keep *them* from polluting the global scope
[08:49:01] <BinaryKitten> Velveeta we're saying the same thing here
[08:49:02] <Velveeta> and since those functions may in turn reference jquery functionality, i wrap them all in an IIFE that passes in jQuery and receives it as $
[08:49:06] <BinaryKitten> just slight variation
[08:49:07] <Velveeta> well, not quite
[08:49:19] <Velveeta> because i don't want to write my function declarations inside of a document.ready block
[08:49:25] <Velveeta> i want them declared in advance of document.ready
[08:49:31] <Velveeta> i just want them declared in a local scope
[08:49:36] <BinaryKitten> yep i understand
[08:49:41] <BinaryKitten> and not disagreeing
[08:50:02] <BinaryKitten> it's all about what you're writing at the time, no fixed rule
[08:50:05] <Velveeta> right
[08:51:47] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: I was told adding a .click() event like you're doing in what you gave me would add an event listening for each and every instance that event can be fired. I'm looking in my Chrome dev console and see that's not the case. Am I misunderstanding something here?
[08:52:13] <xKraty> is there a way from an iframe to call a parent.function that bind elements in the iframe? or since it's executed in the parent there s no way
[08:52:37] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy i'm not binding to document
[08:52:39] <BinaryKitten> so..
[08:52:54] <BinaryKitten> i'm binding to 1 element.
[08:52:56] <BinaryKitten> 1 element = 1 event
[08:53:14] <BinaryKitten> .click(fn) === .on('click', fn)
[08:53:15] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: '$(this).click(function() {' this in a loop means it's binding to a new element each time the loop is ran correct?
[08:53:27] <Velveeta> sprkdev: what you want to do isn't gonna be easily accomplished at all
[08:53:33] <Velveeta> without those data attributes
[08:53:45] <Velveeta> internally, bootstrap is doing stuff like this: $(document).on('click.bs.modal.data-api', '[data-toggle="modal"]', function (e) {
[08:53:46] <SprkDev> don't I just need to match parameters.
[08:53:47] <DeltaHeavy> Oh snap really? I was told by people in here that .click() creates 'n' number of even listeners. I guess jQuery takes care of all that...
[08:53:55] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy yes. It's doing that in a loop to allow for each item to have a unique version of the target
[08:53:59] <Velveeta> so it's using those data attributes as selectors for event delegation
[08:53:59] <SprkDev> that a href data tag is just sending information, no?
[08:54:15] <Velveeta> not sure, let me see what it's doing w/ the href attribute
[08:54:35] <duch_kazatel> goooood morning folks.
[08:55:12] <Velveeta> guten morgen
[08:55:16] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: So what advantage does this offer over just a normal $('.toggle-active').click()?
[08:55:37] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy less dom searching overall
[08:55:38] <DeltaHeavy> Only reason I used .on() was so I could have one event listener instead of 'n'
[08:55:47] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[08:56:04] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy you used .on in delegate mode.. which is different to .on in bind mode
[08:56:15] <duch_kazatel> they're both bindings, technically.
[08:56:23] <duch_kazatel> the difference is just whether or not you're using delegation.
[08:56:27] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel yes
[08:56:36] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel please use scroll back to get context
[08:56:56] <duch_kazatel> i showed up late - what's this about "Only reason I used .on() was so I could have one event listener instead of 'n'"
[08:57:41] <Velveeta> sprkdev: it looks like it's just using an href attribute, not a data-href, so you could easily supply an href attribute... however, the event bindings are being done using an attribute selector on data-toggle and data-dismiss attributes, so in order to make it work 100%, you'd need to supply those types of attributes also
[08:57:47] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel switching from a $(document).on('click', '.class', function() { }) to this -> pastebin.com/FuwkuuZH
[08:57:56] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: So, now knowing that the only reason I was doing delegation was to cut down on JS listeners, would using this serve my purpose just fine? https://www.refheap.com/62400
[08:57:59] <Velveeta> and i think your original question was something about using js to create a bootstrap modal without the data attributes, right?
[08:58:33] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy yes, but is heavier on Dom searches
[08:58:53] <Velveeta> also, you're not injecting any other toggle-active elements after the fact are you?
[08:58:53] <BinaryKitten> since every time you click, it does a dom search
[08:59:07] <BinaryKitten> Velveeta we've covered that and found it not
[08:59:11] <Velveeta> ok cool
[08:59:13] <BinaryKitten> :)
[08:59:13] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: Damn, this is news to me...
[08:59:17] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten aaaah, though the .each() is probably unnecessary.
[08:59:26] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel whyso?
[08:59:44] <BinaryKitten> the each allows for a private instance of the var per item
[09:00:37] <duch_kazatel> why would you need that, though?  is it just to get "toggleItem"?
[09:01:25] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel yes, to prevent multiple dom searches which really are not needed
[09:01:43] <BinaryKitten> it does 1 search for each target, caches that and never has to look again
[09:01:53] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaah, i get it.  not necessarily the way I would have done that, but clever.
[09:02:12] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: Do you perhaps have a resource that would help me understand why it does multiple DOM searches on a single click event like that?
[09:02:18] <BinaryKitten> since the toggle item can (and most likely) be different per item
[09:02:27] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy think about how functions work.
[09:02:31] <BinaryKitten> DeltaHeavy .. $(xxxx) = dom search
[09:02:32] <DeltaHeavy> I always thought it just loaded up all instances of .class and made an element out of it.
[09:02:47] <DeltaHeavy> I thought when the event is created it no longer needs to look for .event
[09:02:59] <BinaryKitten> each time you click, it fires that event function. Each time that event function runs it does $('.active-' ......) which is a dom search
[09:03:02] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy any time you invoke $(), you're running the jquery function, which can be expensive.
[09:03:21] <Velveeta> the other day, on a work skype channel, we were talking about the iconic font library, and how IE7 requires us to fire this .iconic plugin function to create the font icons properly, and how one guy solved the problem using a single-run css expression, but hadn't covered all his bases
[09:03:31] <duch_kazatel> any time you can cache the results of $() is a good thing.
[09:03:39] <Velveeta> and so in order to cover the rest, we said "until that's been done, you'll need to call .iconic() when you inject new content"
[09:03:46] <Velveeta> and then one guy decided to volunteer this gem:
[09:03:54] <DeltaHeavy> So any time I have an event that's applied to muliple elements, I should create the event in a loop?
[09:03:59] <Velveeta> setInterval(function(){ $('*').iconic(); }, 1); boom! problem solved.
[09:04:04] <duch_kazatel> either that, or cache your selector.
[09:04:10] <BinaryKitten> Velveeta SHEEEEEET!
[09:04:12] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta that is terrible.
[09:04:13] <Velveeta> heheheheh
[09:04:17] <duch_kazatel> well done.
[09:04:18] <Velveeta> yeah, but it was intentionally terrible :D
[09:04:20] <duch_kazatel> pat them on the back.
[09:04:20] <decx> yikes
[09:04:24] <Velveeta> it elicited a lol from me
[09:04:28] <duch_kazatel> good.
[09:04:29] <BinaryKitten> Velveeta i would have thought a $.ajaxComplete or equiv
[09:04:33] <loincloth> has anyone tried to use jquery.waypoints in a require.js environment? if so, did you run into any issues?
[09:04:47] <DeltaHeavy> God damn...this is making my head hurt...never really looked at jQuery like this before...
[09:04:58] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy not always.  it depends on the scenario.
[09:05:01] <duch_kazatel> the key is caching.
[09:05:10] <duch_kazatel> any time you can reduce dom lookups is a good thing (tm)
[09:05:12] <Velveeta> i suggested a $.ajaxSuccess catch-all callback, but they decided they said that'd lead to too much dom manip if they fired it for the whole dom for every ajax request
[09:05:20] <Velveeta> that's when the other guy said "just do this. boom"
[09:05:28] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[09:05:29] <DeltaHeavy> I think I'll just make a note of this and do it the easy way.
[09:05:33] <DeltaHeavy> And optimize it later.
[09:05:42] <DeltaHeavy> Cause my brain is seriously unable to fully understand this right now lol.
[09:05:49] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy be aware that attribute selectors are BALLS SLOW
[09:06:00] <Velveeta> deltaheavy: until you get well-versed in write-time optimizations, which only really comes from experience, it's always best to write it so it works, and optimize when you have need
[09:06:01] <duch_kazatel> as in, don't use them when you can get away with it.
[09:06:13] <duch_kazatel> yeah exactly, listen to Velveeta
[09:06:22] <BinaryKitten> yep
[09:06:25] <BinaryKitten> agreed
[09:06:27] <DeltaHeavy> Velveeta: Yeah, I think I'll keep that in mind.
[09:06:35] <BinaryKitten> since you asked for the best way..
[09:06:37] <duch_kazatel> it's that case of "don't prematurely optimize".
[09:06:38] <Velveeta> however, once you go through the same scenarios over and over, you'll recognize them as you're writing them
[09:06:48] <BinaryKitten> i gave you my opinion based on the information at hand :D
[09:06:50] <Velveeta> and then you can do things like binarykitten did, up front, because you'll anticipate that situation
[09:07:00] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: Yeah, I do apprichate it though? I never knew that stuff.
[09:07:18] <BinaryKitten> as Velveeta and duch_kazatel said, it's from experience
[09:07:31] <DeltaHeavy> I do apprichate it though!*
[09:07:31] <BinaryKitten> i've had to write fast running, memory heavy apps
[09:07:35] <DeltaHeavy> Not a question mark sorry @_@
[09:07:52] <DeltaHeavy> BinaryKitten: Yeah, this is going to just be a portfolio site for myself. One page site for the most part anyway.
[09:08:03] <Velveeta> yeah, and i'm on our coreservices team, so i have to write components that are used in all of our products, so they have to be responsive and lightweight, or else all of our products get bogged down
[09:08:10] <DeltaHeavy> I don't think I'd really make an 'app' in jQ.
[09:08:21] <Velveeta> good for you
[09:08:28] <Velveeta> unless you really really like spaghetti :)
[09:08:31] <BinaryKitten> :D
[09:08:31] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:08:35] <BinaryKitten> mmmm meatballs
[09:08:56] <Velveeta> i'm currently wading slowly into the world of angular..... it's.............. interesting
[09:08:56] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, I've had that happen. When I was first learning webdev like two years ago, my first JavaScript app in general was the most horrid one page app ever.
[09:09:05] <DeltaHeavy> Angular is sik
[09:09:24] <Velveeta> angular does some things wonderfully, like abstracting away a lot of boilerplate so the developer can focus on business logic
[09:09:38] <duch_kazatel> uh, i'm not a fan of the way they munge markup.
[09:09:39] <duch_kazatel> *eh
[09:09:42] <Velveeta> but what that necessitates in the markup.... it just makes me feel dirty
[09:09:49] <BinaryKitten> i was mostly using requireJS with external lib and jQuery
[09:10:00] <duch_kazatel> i like how riot.js looks.  or backbone.
[09:10:02] <BinaryKitten> i did learn a lot of memory tricks for magic loading
[09:10:12] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, it messes up the markup but I think the trade off for what you get from it is well worth it.
[09:10:15] <Velveeta> yeah i've done a decent amount of backbone work, using rjs server side to precompile everything
[09:10:29] <Velveeta> i haven't played with riot yet, but it's definitely interesting, being as lightweight as it is
[09:10:46] <SprkDev> problem almost solved. Now another problem I had before came back.
[09:10:59] <Velveeta> reboot twice
[09:11:00] <SprkDev> when we load another page, if we want only a specific div we say
[09:11:03] <Velveeta> that usually fixes it
[09:11:10] <SprkDev> url space div tag right?
[09:11:15] <SprkDev> well it worked before
[09:11:16] <crazyjawa> If i have a simple index.php page with php includes for header and footer and set my page title's individually at the top of each page with         <title>Nothing But Noodles - Charlotte - <?php echo $section; ?></title> and change that variable through php at the top of each page and then i am ajaxing in each page's content so the header and footer's stay the same, is there a way for jquery to access those php variables
[09:11:16] <crazyjawa>  and update the titles?
[09:11:19] <SprkDev> but now it doesnt
[09:11:43] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa only if you make that data available through the ajax request.
[09:11:47] <Velveeta> sprkdev: are you talking about the actual .load function, and doing something like this? $('my/url/path #someDiv', callback) ?
[09:12:01] <Velveeta> er $(element).load(^^that)
[09:12:03] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa one that data is sent to the browser, there's no magical "sharing variables".
[09:12:22] <SprkDev> here it is http://pastebin.com/VyVe7pcR
[09:12:38] <SprkDev> the part with path + video-single-1
[09:12:39] <Velveeta> crazyjawa: yeah, in order to share the variable, you'd need to output it as a js variable
[09:12:46] <SprkDev> I've removed the # afterwards
[09:12:59] <Velveeta> like ?> <script> var somePhpVar = <?php echo $myVar; ?>; </script> <?php
[09:13:20] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa are you shipping your ajaxed content as JSON?
[09:13:39] <Velveeta> sprkdev: so the video-single-1 is the part of the path?
[09:13:50] <crazyjawa> no just a very simple .load() to swap out the current html in the middle of the page
[09:14:15] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa then you'll need to come up with something a little more involved
[09:14:16] <SprkDev> yes, coz I only want that in the modal and not the entire page.
[09:14:24] <SprkDev> I dont want to see header and footer
[09:14:57] <Velveeta> sparkdev: what i'm asking is, is 'video-single-1' part of the url itself, or is that supposed to be the section of the dom that's loaded from the url?
[09:15:24] <crazyjawa> so i cant just simply wrapped my php tags that have the variables defined at the top of each page with script tags?
[09:15:56] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa unless you call the server for updated data, how would the variables update?
[09:16:21] <crazyjawa> true...i feel like i'm going about this in the wrong way
[09:16:22] <Velveeta> crazyjawa: nope, php is executed prior to shipping to the client
[09:16:34] <Tomashe> hey guys whats the other way arround for $.parseJSON();
[09:16:36] <Velveeta> anywhere you have php variable references, it's going to output the literal values of those befire shipping
[09:16:38] <Velveeta> before*
[09:16:49] <Velveeta> tomashe: JSON.stringify() is probably what you're looking for
[09:16:56] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa instead, consider shipping JSON to your frontend and rendering that.
[09:17:09] <Tomashe> inside object comes right?
[09:17:17] <duch_kazatel> wut
[09:17:19] <Velveeta> yep, like JSON.stringify(myObj)
[09:17:52] <crazyjawa> so when i call in a new html page with .load() and the .php page that is ajaxed in has variables declared at the top of that page, those variables will be declared right?
[09:17:56] <Tomashe> yes
[09:17:57] <Tomashe> thanks
[09:18:15] <Velveeta> crazyjawa: what types of variables are you talking about? php or javascript?
[09:18:20] <crazyjawa> php variables
[09:18:32] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa only on those pages that are generated, if that makes sense.
[09:18:33] <Velveeta> your php variables will be interpreted and output as their literal values, not as variables
[09:18:51] <crazyjawa> so they wont be accessible to the original page that is actually calling in the content?
[09:18:57] <Velveeta> right
[09:19:00] <crazyjawa> grr
[09:19:01] <crazyjawa> ok
[09:19:14] <Velveeta> if you want them to be accessible by the page that's already loaded, you need to dump them out as javascript variables
[09:19:19] <Velveeta> using something similar to what i posted up above
[09:19:31] <Tomashe> Velveeta: there is a way to make regular html into json validate using js?
[09:19:50] <duch_kazatel> think of it this way, calling a PHP page is like running a script locally and then copying the output from the terminal and pasting it somewhere else.  unless you do all those things again (and in that order), you're not going to do what you need
[09:20:07] <Tomashe> :/
[09:20:46] <crazyjawa> ok i understand the php part and how it's updating the page...but i guess i just don't get how to somehow mingle my php with my js
[09:21:01] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa you know how PHP outputs HTML?
[09:21:04] <Velveeta> tomashe: i'm not sure what you're trying to ask there
[09:21:10] <crazyjawa> yes
[09:21:13] <duch_kazatel> it can output different data formats.
[09:21:25] <duch_kazatel> but it still needs to output
[09:21:33] <Velveeta> crazyjawa: think of the javascript output as being no different from the html output
[09:21:45] <Velveeta> if you can do this: <div><?php $content; ?></div>
[09:21:59] <crazyjawa> the problem as i understand it is that the php is outputting html but because its ajaxed in the browser isn't actually getting that content so i can't access it as html from jquery
[09:22:05] <crazyjawa> am i correct?
[09:22:06] <Velveeta> you can similarly do this: <script>var myVar = <?php echo $myPhpVar; ?>;</script>
[09:22:22] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa no
[09:22:23] <Velveeta> ajax will read consumable html just fine
[09:22:35] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa you have to get that HTML to the page in the first place.
[09:22:52] <duch_kazatel> the transport mechanism isn't important, but it has to get into the page.
[09:23:06] <duch_kazatel> the javascript lives in an entirely different place than the PHP - it's a different execution environment.
[09:23:13] <crazyjawa> ok well then why wouldn't my title update when i switch from page to page?
[09:23:26] <duch_kazatel> because you're not having your javascript update the title.
[09:23:31] <duch_kazatel> you need to manually update the title.
[09:24:06] <crazyjawa> how would i go about that?
[09:24:18] <duch_kazatel> ship the updated title via the ajaxed content.
[09:24:28] <duch_kazatel> then, in your javascript, replace the page title with the new one.
[09:24:33] <crazyjawa> right now when i switch from page to page that is ajaxed in and check the titles, they are not updating based on the php variable that is on each page
[09:24:46] <duch_kazatel> does the ajaxed content have the new title?
[09:25:08] <Velveeta> you're still not understanding that php doesn't exist when you ship that to the browser
[09:25:14] <Velveeta> there's no such thing as a php variable in the browser
[09:25:29] <duch_kazatel> the only thing the page sees is data - HTML or JSON or XML or CSV or whatever.
[09:25:40] <duch_kazatel> not PHP.  the browser just recieves a convoluted text string.
[09:25:47] <Velveeta> you have to output that php variable in some form that the browser can read it and use it
[09:25:47] <crazyjawa> ok so i get that...but i'm just not understanding then how to tell ajax to grab the new title
[09:25:57] <crazyjawa> i'm assuming that it's going to automatically change it i guess
[09:26:03] <Velveeta> crazyjawa: let me whip you up a fiddle to demonstrate something you'll want to do
[09:26:03] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:26:04] <duch_kazatel> it won't.
[09:26:30] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa the URL you're hitting needs to have the title in it - does it have that?
[09:26:41] <duch_kazatel> wait, is the URL a full other page?  doctype and all?
[09:26:56] <crazyjawa> no just the meat of the body
[09:27:07] <crazyjawa> just replacing the wrapper div basically
[09:27:14] <crazyjawa> swapping it out for each new page on the site
[09:27:18] <duch_kazatel> okay - and does that content have the title in it somewhere?
[09:28:00] <duch_kazatel> think about it - you have to manually replace wrapper div.  the title is the same way.
[09:28:05] <duch_kazatel> it's just another tag.
[09:28:08] <crazyjawa> no the title is only declared on the first page but the title is declared as <title>This is my <?php $title ?> </title> and then each page has $title declared at the top that is ajaxed in
[09:28:31] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa but is that information included in the ajaxed in content?
[09:28:58] <crazyjawa> the php variable is declared at the top of each piece of content (the new php page which is replacing the body)
[09:29:00] <duch_kazatel> HTML is static - the browser has zero knowledge of what your server is doing.  all it gets is the data it requested.
[09:29:19] <crazyjawa> so $title will change each time i ajax in new content
[09:29:29] <crazyjawa> i guess its just not knowing to update the title tag
[09:29:31] <duch_kazatel> right - html has no idea what that means.
[09:29:42] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa you're fetching a wrapper div.
[09:29:50] <duch_kazatel> there is no context of a title tag.
[09:29:57] <crazyjawa> so the title above it in the header is never changing
[09:30:01] <crazyjawa> i'm understanding now
[09:30:14] <duch_kazatel> right.  because, just like your wrapper div, you have to manually update it.
[09:30:41] <duch_kazatel> HTML is static - there's a reason you have to ajax content in to update a page without fully reloading it.
[09:31:07] <duch_kazatel> you need to include that title tag text as apart of the payload data you're shipping.
[09:32:25] <crazyjawa> think i've got it now...thanks for the help!
[09:32:40] <duch_kazatel> just remember, the title tag is like anything else on the page.
[09:32:48] <duch_kazatel> you have to manually update it yourself.
[09:35:51] <Velveeta> ok crazyjawa: http://jsfiddle.net/cYBSk/
[09:36:03] <Velveeta> simulating an ajax request w/ that contentMap at the top
[09:36:21] <Velveeta> you'll want to pass the new page title in some kind of tag or something that you can reference from the client
[09:36:30] <Velveeta> and then parse it out of the response and use that to set your page title
[09:37:11] <Velveeta> if you're passing the entire included head section, you can just parse out the title tag from that, and use it to set the current page title
[09:44:44] <mikeche1en> when using jquery mobile with an android webview app, i am having a problem that the page gets refreshed and dynamic dom elements are lost when the screen is rotated
[09:48:37] <mikeche1en> hmm i guess this more an android issue
[09:51:11] <bmilesp> hello, is it possible to isolate a set of plugins to use a no conflict jquery version? i want to use typahead.js with the latest version of jquery, but i also have to deal with pages that have two version of juqery in no conflict already
[09:51:32] <Velveeta> lol, northeast... http://i.imgur.com/vIQn23E.jpg
[09:52:17] <Velveeta> bmilsp: not without editing the plugin file itself, i don't think... you would want to wrap it in an IIFE and inject the noconflict version of jquery as its $ reference
[09:54:01] <duch_kazatel> bmilesp i'd look at upgrading everything at that point imo.
[09:54:37] <Velveeta> for anybody interested, there's a webinar about to start for "Building Apps that Run Everywhere with jQuery Mobile and PhoneGap" http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/3026
[09:55:08] <decx> still have to use jqm -.-
[09:55:15] <duch_kazatel> lol
[09:55:17] <duch_kazatel> word
[09:56:10] <Velveeta> yeah i don't use jqm myself, but i read and watch most things i can get my hands on just for idea generation ;)
[09:56:50] <Velveeta> sorry wu tang, it's pause-time...
[09:58:19] <bmilesp> @duch_kazatel i agree, unfortunately  this site is coded in the worst way possible, and would take weeks so that's out of the question for now
[09:58:54] <decx> with 3 jq versions it will also take weeks to load :>
[10:00:10] <Velveeta> we have one of our products currently running on 3 different versions of a mix of jquery and our internal widget library
[10:00:30] <Velveeta> because product management keeps pushing features, so all they can do is keep up with work and piecemeal converting of pages over to the latest
[10:01:49] <tyteen4a03> hey, I have code that wants to modify just one part of the css style property, for example text-decoration: overline underline, how would I remove overline or underline and keep the other intact with hopefully one method call?
[10:02:50] <duch_kazatel> bmilesp lol i'm working through an update of jquery right now - I'm aware of the pains.
[10:03:03] <Velveeta> you can't just trim bits and pieces of a css property like that, you'd have to reassign the full value minus what you don't want
[10:03:38] <Velveeta> the only time you can trim pieces is when it's a compound property like "border: 1px solid #000" which you could then reference an individual property value to modify, like "border-color: #fff"
[10:09:26] <Velveeta> there was a 'kraft' in here too?
[10:09:41] <duch_kazatel> hahaha apparently.
[10:09:47] <duch_kazatel> we get some great usernames in here.
[10:11:01] <BillCriswell> guys
[10:11:19] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell++
[10:11:39] <BillCriswell> I am so tired of 2048 on HN.
[10:11:47] <duch_kazatel> same here!  let it die!
[10:12:28] <Velveeta> ;p;
[10:12:32] <Velveeta> er lol
[10:12:37] <Velveeta> have you seen flappy 2048? :D
[10:12:45] <duch_kazatel> yes :(
[10:12:50] <Velveeta> heheheh
[10:12:57] <duch_kazatel> turrible.
[10:12:57] <BillCriswell> It was a lot easiesr than the real flappy bird
[10:13:01] <decx> there's also flappy 2048 ai
[10:13:12] <Velveeta> billcriswell: definitely
[10:13:14] <decx> and flappy 2048 loga
[10:13:29] <Velveeta> i made it to 15 points on the 2nd try... flappy birds took me 15 tries just to make it to the 2nd point
[10:16:08] <BillCriswell> My high score ending up being 38.
[10:20:03] <tyteen4a03> Velveeta, so no convenient class removing and adding for css property values... too bad
[10:20:31] <duch_kazatel> tyteen4a03 you mean method.
[10:20:33] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:20:38] <duch_kazatel> and there is - .css()
[10:20:49] <duch_kazatel> .css('property', 'value')
[10:20:50] <Velveeta> yeah, there's the css function, but it won't let you trim bits of properties
[10:21:05] <duch_kazatel> not unless you parse it first.
[10:21:06] <Velveeta> like you can't take a text-decoration: overline underline; and call the css() function to remove just the overline value
[10:21:17] <duch_kazatel> .css('property') will get you the value.
[10:21:19] <Velveeta> right, you would have to resupply the full value (after trimming it manually)
[10:21:35] <duch_kazatel> yep
[10:22:20] <decx> like this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/VWq7u/
[10:22:24] <decx> just better and less crap
[10:22:43] <Velveeta> lol
[10:22:51] <Velveeta> property value roulette :D
[10:22:57] <decx> indeed
[10:23:06] <decx> oh now i missed overline in the css :D
[10:23:07] <Velveeta> i do so love to gamble
[10:23:25] <decx> set as base and nothing ever happened
[10:23:58] <decx> actually it will go by the standard conventions
[10:24:19] <decx> so even if your css say text-decoration: overline underline, it will be recognized as underline overline
[10:24:46] <Velveeta> i would imagine "the standard conventions" are also browser-specific as to their implementation
[10:24:51] <decx> probably
[10:24:54] <decx> most likely ^^
[10:24:55] <Velveeta> some probably return them in a defined order, and some as-is
[10:26:29] <decx> yes, from overline underline chrome makes "underline overline solid rgb(0, 0, 0)" and ff "underline overline"
[10:27:11] <Velveeta> way to keep us on our toes, browser vendors :D
[10:27:45] <duch_kazatel> weeeee
[10:28:00] <decx> safari does "underline overline"
[10:28:41] <Velveeta> IE does "Fatal error: undefined is not a function"
[10:28:45] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[10:28:46] <Velveeta> ......probably
[10:29:09] <Velveeta> Error: error message 2471 not found.
[10:29:42] <Velveeta> i can't help but picture IE as anything other than the kid that ate glue in class... despite the fact that it's gotten a lot better in the last release or 2
[10:29:49] <Velveeta> it's still always gonna be wearing a helmet in my eyes
[10:29:59] <duch_kazatel> it's gotten progressively better.
[10:30:33] <decx> like the nerd who finally looks good with 24, people will still remember that you ate glue that one time in class and puked
[10:30:50] <duch_kazatel> 11 is actually more compliant overall than other browsers.
[10:30:54] <Velveeta> decx: exactly
[10:30:54] <pirret> i don't really see anything wrong in ie11 but i still do not use it
[10:30:57] <duch_kazatel> though sometiems that has unintended consequences.
[10:31:10] <Velveeta> and the dev tools have taken a sharp upturn in usability
[10:31:21] <duch_kazatel> very sharp.  11s are almost fun to use.
[11:02:28] * Velveeta yells "cannonball!" and jumps into the pool, splashing you... Yes, you personally.
[11:02:36] <duch_kazatel> :(
[11:02:43] <Velveeta> well, not you personally
[11:05:37] <Velveeta> damnit, if nobody needs help, i'm gonna have to find actual work to do
[11:05:47] <duch_kazatel> ugh, the worst.
[11:06:14] <Velveeta> getting paid to do what they pay me to do? how offensive..
[11:08:13] <duch_kazatel> haha
[11:12:33] <Tomashe> Velveeta: u talked before about that template engine but i was wondering . there is a way to UPDATE the template ? lets say that some thing are updated on my map. when load another template the mapContainer deletes, when i want to enter map again. it load the Template orignal. instead of the updated map with markers and so...
[11:12:39] <Tomashe> how do we solve that?
[11:13:23] <decx> can somebody confirm that this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/T45kX/show/ runs like crap on chrome windows?
[11:14:11] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Seems ok here.
[11:14:23] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Awesome, thanks!
[11:14:27] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: My bad haha.
[11:14:33] <BillCriswell> decx: ^
[11:14:39] <DeltaHeavy> Woops lol
[11:14:48] <DeltaHeavy> Thought you were scrolling back to a really old convo earlier today lol
[11:14:52] <decx> damnit whats wrong with my chrome
[11:15:27] <decx> 10000 rects shouldnt choke it out like that
[11:16:02] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Haha nope. For some reason my auto complete gave me you before decx, who spoke most recently... so I dunno.
[11:17:03] <BillCriswell> At least I think IRC clients would take into account...could be my imaginatio
[11:17:21] <BillCriswell> decx: Hmmm...
[11:17:42] <Velveeta> tomashe: it's hard for me to answer a question like that without some more details... you mention a map, are you using google maps or something?
[11:19:02] <Velveeta> the generic answer would be that you need to make your template iterate over some data set and output its contents based on that data set, and when the data updates, feed the new data to your template to get the new state of its markup
[11:21:47] <Tomashe> so just save the data and load the new data when i load the template
[11:22:38] <Velveeta> so you should have something like this: var template = Handlebars.compile($('#myTemplateLocation').html()); $('#mapContainer').html(template(originalData));
[11:22:51] <Velveeta> when that data updates, you would want to do $('#mapContainer').html(template(newData));
[11:23:48] <Tomashe> hmm
[11:24:19] <Velveeta> i'm detecting a question here
[11:24:31] <NChief> if I do $.post("import.php", {file: file.name}, function(data) { }, "json"); I get parsererror.. The responsetext is {"success":true}
[11:24:32] <Tomashe> the problem is that im using leaflet . i lose my bind when i remove the template from the DOM
[11:24:35] <NChief> isnt that valid json?
[11:25:03] <Velveeta> nchief: looks valid to me, is there any whitespace surrounding it? that can sometimes hose the json parser
[11:25:18] <Velveeta> tomashe: i still don't even know what your template is
[11:25:28] <decx> aren't quote around keys mandatory in json?
[11:25:31] <Velveeta> like i said, it's hard to give any real advice without some more details
[11:25:52] <Velveeta> decx: not sure
[11:25:56] <Tomashe> my template is a basic html with <div id="map"></div> . im using leaflet to initialize the map into the id="map"
[11:26:09] <NChief> Velveeta: nope. no whitespace
[11:26:25] <duch_kazatel> hidden characters, NChief?
[11:27:03] <Velveeta> tomashe: ok, you don't really need a template for something that simple... the beauty of templates is really in their data interpolation
[11:27:17] <Velveeta> tomashe: and you mentioned updated data that wasn't showing up in your map, right?
[11:27:18] <NChief> duch_kazatel: shouldnt be.. how can I check?
[11:27:43] <Velveeta> for a template like what you've shown me, that doesn't use data at all, so it wouldn't care if your data updated... you should be feeding that updated data to leaflet somehow, not resetting the template
[11:28:02] <Tomashe> yes and the MAP is the simple thing , i got 10 more pages with more data
[11:28:03] <NChief> if I do console.log() on the data I get responseText: "ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿{"success":true}"
[11:28:39] <Tomashe> ohh u u say i in the map case i should just leave the map alive just without show it
[11:28:43] <Tomashe> hidden
[11:29:07] <Tomashe> the thing is i want my DOM to be clear as possible so everything will just SKYROCK with preformacec
[11:29:08] <Tomashe> s
[11:29:10] <Velveeta> decx: oh yeah, and in answer to your question, JSON.parse('{success:true}') throws an error "SyntaxError: Unexpected token s" whereas JSON.parse('{"success":true}') parses properly, so it would appear quotes are required
[11:29:51] <Velveeta> tomashe: no, what i'm saying is that your updated data, which presumably controls what data points should be visible on your map, doesn't have anything to do with the template you posted.. it has everything to do with leaflet
[11:30:10] <Velveeta> so if leaflet isn't displaying the updated data, it's because you haven't properly told leaflet to display that data, not because you're rendering your template wrong or something
[11:30:20] <decx> yeah i remember adding some json into a data-attribute and it throwing a hissyfit because ' ' wasn't good enough. had to be " "
[11:30:29] <Velveeta> spleh
[11:30:56] <Tomashe> i know that , my question was how do i solve this issue but i guess i will try something that just cross my mind
[11:31:03] <NChief> Velveeta: but my response is quoted?
[11:31:34] <Velveeta> nchief: right, but the error i posted was different from the one you showed, we were just talking philosophically about whether json required quoting property names :)
[11:31:45] <NChief> ah :)
[11:31:53] <Velveeta> tomashe: it sounds like you need to look into the leaflet api to figure out how to pass it new data points for display
[11:32:09] <Tomashe> i know how to do so
[11:32:18] <Tomashe> i just dont know how to rebind everyting is a simple way
[11:32:32] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what was bound in the first place.. i never saw any binding code..
[11:32:55] <Velveeta> but you shouldn't need to redraw your template at least
[11:33:04] <Velveeta> and you said that after redrawing it, that's when you lost your bindings
[11:33:35] <NChief> SyntaxError {stack: (...), message: "Unexpected token ï»¿"} is some more of the error message
[11:34:13] <Velveeta> interesting
[11:34:35] <Velveeta> now i *have* seen cases, and i can't even remember what caused them, where the json parser didn't want to parse an object literal for some reason
[11:34:48] <Velveeta> but wrapping that in square brackets to make it an array, and then taking the index 0 afterwards, worked just fine
[11:35:04] <Velveeta> e.g. instead of {"success":true}, [{"success":true}]
[11:35:10] <Velveeta> and then after parsing, taking that value[0]
[11:35:28] <Velveeta> it sounds stupid, but i've seen it work when the parser choked for whatever reason
[11:36:27] <NChief> the response is from php doing json_encode(array('success' => true));
[11:37:18] <Velveeta> see what happens if you do json_encode(array(array('success' => true))), just for s'n'g
[11:39:04] <NChief> Velveeta: same error
[11:39:35] <Velveeta> hmmm... in that case, you may need to drop a breakpoint and step back into the bowels of jquery to see what exactly it's trying to parse when it chokes
[11:39:46] <duch_kazatel> NChief do you see a weird red dot before or after your JSON in your console?
[11:39:55] <Velveeta> if it's on a publicly-available url, and you have a consistent recreate for it, i can probably help w/ that
[11:40:09] <NChief> duch_kazatel: nope
[11:40:17] <duch_kazatel> sounds like an invisible char is causing your problem.
[11:41:08] <Velveeta> $(jsonString).filter(':hidden').remove(); // sanitized!
[11:41:14] <duch_kazatel> lel
[11:41:20] <duch_kazatel> i wish it were that easy.
[11:41:23] <Velveeta> heheheh
[11:41:36] <duch_kazatel> text is hard.
[11:41:38] <duch_kazatel> :(
[11:42:27] <Hyperking> any one know a powerful image optimizer using a task runner?
[11:42:28] <Velveeta> we had to fight the machines for the right to use text vs binary, you'd better support our troops by communicating in readable language
[11:43:03] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: I've used imagemin
[11:43:06] <BillCriswell> With gulp
[11:43:45] <Velveeta> well look who jumped on the alternative-task-runner bandwagon
[11:43:45] <Absolute0> Can I pass an array of deferrds to $.when?
[11:43:46] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: im using gulp-imagemin, but it's not compressing enough
[11:43:58] <Velveeta> absolute0: yep, if you pass them with $.when.apply
[11:44:05] <darkfrog> I'm inserting a text input into the title bar ('.ui-dialog-title') in a jQueryUI Dialog and that works fine, but the dragging is intercepting so the input cannot receive focus.  Is there any way to exclude the input from being dragged while still allowing the rest of the title bar to be draggable?
[11:44:43] <Tomashe> whats better to make on listener and do if (hasClass(x) {} OR to make few listers each listen to another class ?
[11:44:48] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: http://compresspng.com/ this site does the BEST job, does imagemin provide compression options?
[11:44:52] <Velveeta> darkfrog: you'd probably have to add a mousedown listener to your input and do an e.stopPropagation()
[11:45:12] <Absolute0> Velveeta: can you give me an example of that?
[11:45:14] <Velveeta> tomashe: are they all calling the same callback function?
[11:45:25] <NChief> Velveeta: if the _only_ thing i do in import.php is to echo json_encode(array('success' => true)); it works. so yeah. probably som invisible char.
[11:45:29] <Velveeta> absolute0: $.when.apply(this, myArrayOfDeferreds);
[11:45:31] <NChief> now I just need to find it :p
[11:45:42] <Velveeta> er, $.when.apply(this, myArrayOfDeferreds).done(callback);
[11:45:44] <Absolute0> Velveeta: what is this?
[11:46:03] <Velveeta> whatever the current context is, it's unimportant, because $.when doesn't use 'this' internally
[11:46:11] <Velveeta> you could pass null for that first argument just as easily
[11:46:31] <Absolute0> Velveeta: the examples on stackoverflow use $ instead of this
[11:46:35] <BillCriswell> Yeah there's a few Hyperking.
[11:47:01] <Tomashe> ssame with same container listener
[11:47:05] <Hyperking> BillCriswell:where is it documented??
[11:47:10] <Tomashe> all*
[11:47:26] <Tomashe> all start like that mainContainer.on("click","
[11:47:57] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin shows some of thme.
[11:48:00] <Velveeta> absolute0: that would work fine also, since $.when belongs to the $ namespace, so if it ever did use an internal reference to 'this', that would be correct
[11:49:12] <Absolute0> Velveeta: will this blow up: http://pastie.org/8954252 ?
[11:49:14] <darkfrog> Velveeta: that did the trick, thanks. :)
[11:49:27] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe it depends on what you're binding and how.
[11:49:34] <Absolute0> since I am using always, how many times will it be called?
[11:49:37] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: gulp not grunt, but will try those options
[11:49:58] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: The options are still the same.
[11:50:07] <Velveeta> absolute0: it'll only be called once per submit, but it will submit the form whether those deferreds objects are resolved or rejected
[11:50:20] <Velveeta> if you only want it to submit when they've all been resolved (no failures), use done instead of always
[11:50:31] <Velveeta> darkfrog: awesome :)
[11:51:05] <Velveeta> tomashe: if they're all for the same callback, i'd just lump them all together with a compound selector, like mainContainer.on('click', '.class1, .class2, .classN', callback)
[11:51:21] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: .pipe(imagemin({ optimizationLevel: 3, progressive: true, interlaced: true })).pipe(gulp.dest(foo));
[11:51:35] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: http://bpaste.net/show/y9sq8hEkrzXHos3erCeq/
[11:51:55] <Hyperking> BillCriswell:lol thanks
[11:51:59] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: You don't need the option.
[11:52:01] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:52:07] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:52:16] <Velveeta> absolute0: oh yeah, and to answer your other question, nothing else in that looks like it should blow up, but your use of $this = this could be misleading to other developers, who usually use $variable to denote a jquery-wrapped variable
[11:52:46] <Velveeta> if you're just trying to maintain a reference to the current scope, you could use self = this, or you could pass the scope to your callback with something like $.proxy()
[11:52:52] <duch_kazatel> aaaah almost done with my first phase $.browser abatement!  woooo!
[11:53:33] <Fervicus> Anyoner here use select2? How can I get back the value as a list of text as opposed to a object of {id, text} ?
[11:53:54] <duch_kazatel> "a list of text"?
[11:54:01] <Velveeta> fervicus: you could run that object through a map function
[11:54:02] <duch_kazatel> care to provide and example of what that would look like?
[11:54:13] <Velveeta> my guess is an array of text snippets
[11:54:22] <duch_kazatel> ah, the pythonic "list"
[11:55:06] <Absolute0> Velveeta: how can I stall within a $(form).submit() call until all my $.ajax calls complete?
[11:55:49] <NoiseEee> why are you sending xhr and a form submission?
[11:55:59] <Fervicus> Velveeta: yeah, but I am using it with angular, so I would have to do that on a $watcb
[11:56:03] <Fervicus> *watch
[11:56:08] <Velveeta> absolute0: there's no way to stall that form.submit() call, the way you're handling it would be the proper way
[11:56:13] <Absolute0> NoiseEee: drag and drop file uploads..
[11:56:20] <Fervicus> Would be nice if I could just get back text
[11:56:30] <Velveeta> you have to preventDefault on the original event, and then invoke the native form.submit function when you're ready
[11:56:52] <NoiseEee> Absolute0: myForm.on('submit',function(e) { //stop the submit event;  var xhr = $.ajax(//etc};  xhr.done($(myForm).submit())   }  kind of thing
[11:56:55] <Velveeta> alternatively, you could specify a boolean variable to pass to your event to tell it to *actually* submit
[11:57:27] <Absolute0> NoiseEee: I have a variable number of file uploads going on
[11:57:34] <Velveeta> noiseeee: if they do that, though, aren't they gonna run into an infinite loop of stopping the submit event, submitting an xhr, and then submitting the submit event again?
[11:57:47] <NoiseEee> why are they happening on form submission and not immediately, Absolute0?
[11:58:04] <Absolute0> NoiseEee: they are happening immediately but if the file is large it might take a while...
[11:58:13] <NoiseEee> Absolute0: so set a flag, ie: ableToSubmit
[11:58:16] <Velveeta> fervicus: i don't use select2, and am not sure if it offers a way to specify its return format, but i'm gonna guess it doesn't, so you'll have to shim in a solution
[11:58:31] <Fervicus> ok thanks
[11:58:39] <whoisthis> I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me out with the logistics behind creating a modal that grabs information from another page on my site?
[11:58:40] <Absolute0> Velveeta: does e.preventDefault mess with the originalevent?
[11:58:51] <Velveeta> absolute0: yep, it cancels the native form submit
[11:59:01] <duch_kazatel> whoisthis huh?
[11:59:02] <NoiseEee> and have it false when xhr uploads are happening, true when each is complete
[11:59:06] <duch_kazatel> whoisthis you mean using an iframe or ajax?
[11:59:30] <whoisthis> duch_kazatel: I am think that ajax would be the better option
[11:59:36] <whoisthis> thinking*
[11:59:51] <Absolute0> Velveeta: can you do a quick fiddle of stalling within a $(obj).sumbit until an array of deferrds is completed? This is getting too complicated.
[12:00:04] <duch_kazatel> whoisthis okay - do you have your endpoint setup to serve the data for just the modal?
[12:00:09] <Velveeta> $('form').on('submit', function(e, ableToSubmit) { if (!ableToSubmit) { xhrStuff.done(function () { $('form').trigger('submit', true); }); }});
[12:00:28] <Absolute0> There is jquery event and native events...
[12:00:29] <Velveeta> absolute0: ^^ that's something like what noiseeee and i were talking about by adding an extra parameter to your submit handler
[12:00:47] <whoisthis> duch_kazatel: That is where i am kinda not sure where to go with it all. How would i set up my endpoint to do so?
[12:00:51] <Absolute0> I have an array of xhrStuff, not just one.
[12:01:01] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: how would i call a custom value calling "gulp taskname foldername" ?
[12:01:05] <duch_kazatel> whoisthis no clue!  what server-side framework are you using?
[12:01:15] <Velveeta> right, so you'd substitute the above thing that dealt with $.when.apply, i'll whip up an example, but it's not gonna be functional, just demonstrational
[12:01:29] <duch_kazatel> whoisthis the basic idea is that you would effecitvely need a url that you could hit that returns just the contents of the modal.
[12:01:36] <Absolute0> you can reuse mine: http://pastie.org/8954252
[12:01:49] <whoisthis> duch_kazatel: it is a drupal site which i believe uses php
[12:02:12] <duch_kazatel> okay - i know nothing about drupal (and very little about php), but my initial point still stands.
[12:02:21] <duch_kazatel> see if you can setup a page that just has the data for the modal in it.
[12:02:25] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: foldername would be the custom value set within the gulpfile
[12:02:33] <duch_kazatel> nothing else - no css, scripts, etc.
[12:03:20] <Absolute0> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/6t2uS/
[12:03:23] <Velveeta> absolute0: heh, i wrote one before i saw you post that: http://jsfiddle.net/c9Yqe/
[12:03:40] <Velveeta> but you can frankenstein the concepts into yours
[12:03:50] <whoisthis> duch_kazatel: okay, would you be able to provide me with an example of how i am supposed to set up the page?
[12:04:18] <Absolute0> if you're doing preventDefault, how are you able to trigger form.trigger('submit'...) ?
[12:04:34] <duch_kazatel> whoisthis ... well, no.  because like I said "...i know nothing about drupal (and very little about php)..."
[12:04:34] <Velveeta> you're re-triggering submit on it, and passing true for the value of ableToSubmit
[12:04:49] <Velveeta> once that evaluates to true, it won't preventDefault on the form submission
[12:04:59] <Absolute0> I see
[12:05:03] <whoisthis> duch_kazatel: okay well i appreciate it anyway
[12:05:16] <Absolute0> probably using this.submit() would fix the issue.
[12:05:25] <duch_kazatel> whoisthis you should probably ask that question in a channel dedicated to drupal
[12:05:27] <Velveeta> correct also
[12:05:32] <Absolute0> using the dom element and not the jquery element
[12:05:33] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: There's gulp.env so you can do things like gulp task --dir foo and you can access foo with gulp.env.dir
[12:05:52] <Velveeta> but if you wanted to ajax-submit that form, you could have an else branch in that if-check, so that when ableToSubmit was true, you could ajax-submit the form contents and avoid a page refresh
[12:05:54] <whoisthis> duch_kazatel: okay will do. Thanks again!
[12:06:01] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: "gulp.env has been deprecated. Use your own CLI parser instead. We recommend using optimist or minimist." is the message I got.
[12:06:05] <BillCriswell> When I tried it.
[12:06:11] <Absolute0> Velveeta: will this do what I expect it to do: http://jsfiddle.net/6t2uS/ ?
[12:06:14] <Velveeta> otherwise, if you're doing a standard form post with refresh, the native form.submit() would work fine for your $.when callback
[12:06:39] <Velveeta> absolute0: you'll want to change your $this reference in your $.when callback to point to self instead
[12:06:41] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: ok will look into that. the folder is outside the gulp env folder
[12:06:47] <Absolute0> right :)
[12:06:50] <Absolute0> but other than that?
[12:07:19] <Velveeta> and then other than that, your always could lead to some unexpected behavior
[12:07:24] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: Never tried doing that, but I imaging doing like ../../whatever/whatever would work... but doesn't seem like a good idea.
[12:07:32] <Velveeta> it's going to fire whether or not your deferred objects have succeeded or failed
[12:07:35] <Absolute0> Velveeta: it's submitting, but I am not sure if it's working..
[12:07:40] <Absolute0> it's happens to fast to detect
[12:07:53] <Absolute0> Velveeta: that's irrelevant
[12:07:57] <Velveeta> and in the case of all success, it will wait for all of them to be resolved, but in the case of partial failures, it will still execute
[12:08:17] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: well on second thought, does gulp provide a method of reading an external json file of different path names?
[12:08:19] <Velveeta> ok, also, it may execute prematurely in the case of partial failures, but i'm not positive if always does that
[12:08:34] <Velveeta> i know that if you set up a .fail(), it will be executed as soon as the first deferred in the list fails
[12:08:50] <Velveeta> i'm not sure if always will be invoked right after that, or if it'll actually wait for the whole list to pass/fail first
[12:09:03] <Velveeta> i *believe* it waits for the whole list
[12:09:26] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/sQcqq/ < what do i do wrong here
[12:09:53] <Velveeta> absolute0: looks like i'm wrong, as soon as the (master) deferred is resolved or rejected, the always callback(s) will be executed
[12:10:09] <Absolute0> master deferred?
[12:10:12] <Velveeta> that means if you have 10 uploads, and the first one fails, your callback will be executed immediately, even if the other uploads are still completing
[12:10:17] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe you can't chain like that without extending prototypes.
[12:10:21] <duch_kazatel> you don't want to do that.
[12:10:29] <Velveeta> yeah, $.when takes a list of deferreds and returns 1 master deferred object for you to chain your callbacks off of
[12:10:31] <Tomashe> can u show me how it should be done ?
[12:10:32] <Absolute0> Is $.when(a, b, c) === $.when($, [a,b,c]) ?
[12:10:49] <Velveeta> $.when(a, b, c) === $.when.apply($, [a, b, c])
[12:10:50] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: I'd ask that in #gulp, never tried it before.
[12:10:54] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe replace the first line with servicesList = HandleServicesList(GetServicesList());
[12:11:08] <Absolute0> or is it more like $.when(a); $.when(b); $when(c) ?
[12:11:29] <Absolute0> in which case the always only runs for the first one...
[12:11:32] <Tomashe> i was thinkking about that
[12:11:32] <Velveeta> it depends on the outcome of the deferreds in the list
[12:11:34] <Tomashe> thanks man
[12:12:03] <Velveeta> it will resolve its master deferred based on the outcomes of the deferreds in the list
[12:12:11] <Absolute0> master deferred?
[12:12:16] <Tomashe> weird i got undefined
[12:12:19] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe method chaining requires extending a prototype, which i wouldn't do in your case.  so just pass functions to functions if that's what you need, though that gets very "speghetti-y" after a while.
[12:12:20] <Velveeta> yes, $.when's master deferred, i explained up above
[12:12:51] <Velveeta> the way deferreds change that state, though, is that successes have to wait for all successes to be completed, and failures only have to wait for one
[12:12:56] <Absolute0> what does "master deferred" mean?
[12:13:00] <Velveeta> i explained up above
[12:13:13] <Velveeta> yeah, $.when takes a list of deferreds and returns 1 master deferred object for you to chain your callbacks off of
[12:13:36] <Absolute0> lol: http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/52184/why-was-it-such-a-big-deal-when-jessica-decided-to-have-a-male-child-surely-she
[12:13:49] <Absolute0> stackexchange has some weird sites now...
[12:13:50] <Velveeta> presumably, if you have a list of related tasks that need to complete for an action to occur, if any of them fail, the whole action should fail
[12:14:10] <Velveeta> so if you have a list of N items, success means all N items being successful, but failure means any of N items failing
[12:14:12] <Absolute0> Velveeta: I don't care about failures, I just need them to complete.
[12:14:22] <Tomashe> console.log(servicesList); < this gives me undefined but when i console.log(html) it gives me the html correctly
[12:14:23] <Velveeta> i know *you* don't care, i'm telling you how the deferred objects behave
[12:14:27] <Absolute0> oh
[12:14:41] <Velveeta> so if you attach a .always() callback, it will be executed once the deferred has changed state, one way or the other
[12:14:48] <Absolute0> so will $.when.apply().always wait for all to complete? fail or success?
[12:15:10] <Velveeta> but if it's deemed a failure, because any of the uploads fails, it will be executed immediately, without waiting for the other uploads to complete (success or failure), because 1 fail is deemed an all-fail
[12:15:22] <Tomashe> so why its not passing it into the servicesList
[12:15:23] <Absolute0> I see
[12:15:33] <Velveeta> $.when in general (.apply, or otherwise) will wait for all to complete in the case of success, and will only wait for 1 to fail in the case of failure
[12:16:22] <Velveeta> so in order to wait for the whole list to complete, success *or* failure, you'll need something a little fancier, let me write up a sample
[12:16:36] <Velveeta> i'll use your existing fiddle
[12:16:49] <Tomashe> HandleServicesList(GetServicesList()); < this isnt good :/
[12:16:59] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:17:01] <duch_kazatel> it's not :)
[12:17:10] <Tomashe> so what is the solution :/
[12:17:22] <Absolute0> http://jsfiddle.net/6t2uS/4/
[12:17:40] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe really?
[12:17:41] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel: any ideas?
[12:17:41] <Absolute0> http://jsfiddle.net/6t2uS/6/
[12:17:44] <duch_kazatel> i feel like you're not trying.
[12:17:52] <Tomashe> i am trying but i got confuseddd
[12:18:10] <Absolute0> http://jsfiddle.net/6t2uS/7/
[12:18:11] <Tomashe> GetServicesList().HandleServicesList();
[12:18:14] <Tomashe> why this isnt working
[12:18:15] <Velveeta> absolute0: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6t2uS/8/
[12:18:26] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe because you'd have to extend the function prototype for that to work.
[12:18:27] <Tomashe> i get the services .. pass the result to the handle services and i should get the data back
[12:18:32] <duch_kazatel> do not do that, because that's a terrible idea.
[12:18:37] <Tomashe> how do i extend it ?
[12:18:40] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe servicesList is an ajax method call, not the results.
[12:18:43] <Velveeta> absolute0: oh yeah, change my ajaxDeferrds reference to just deferrds, i missed that
[12:18:47] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe don't extend prototypes you don't own.
[12:19:01] <Tomashe> hmm
[12:19:08] <Tomashe> so how do i OWN it ?
[12:19:12] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[12:19:13] <Velveeta> so what it does is attach an always() listener to each of the deferreds in the list, so that as each one finishes, pass or fail, it resolves another separate deferred object
[12:19:22] <duch_kazatel> you're returning the wrong thing from GetServicesList.
[12:19:24] <Velveeta> then it passes that separate array of deferreds to $.when, which will always pass
[12:19:37] <Tomashe> ohh..
[12:19:39] <Velveeta> so $.when has no choice but to wait for all deferreds to complete one way or the other
[12:19:41] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe are you trying to return the data that comes back from that post?
[12:19:47] <Absolute0> Velveeta: this sort of programming is hard to follow... Sort of like goto statements...
[12:19:54] <Tomashe> yes .
[12:19:58] <Tomashe> so i need return data ?
[12:20:09] <duch_kazatel> no.  data is what you're sending.
[12:20:17] <Velveeta> deferreds take a little bit of time to wrap your head around them, but it helps with code organization, and writing truly asynchronous code, without a crap-ton of callback nesting
[12:20:24] <Tomashe> i mean i can add .done(data) { return data }
[12:20:41] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe you'd start here: http://jsfiddle.net/sQcqq/1/
[12:20:58] <Velveeta> absolute0: i'll add some comments to clarify some of it
[12:21:21] <Absolute0> Velveeta: what are you achieving by adding those passFailDeferreds?
[12:21:22] <Tomashe> hmm
[12:21:24] <jugglinmike> Has anyone used jQuery Mobile in an AMD project? I'm having trouble loading the slider completely.
[12:21:34] <Velveeta> absolute0: i'm achieving forcing $.when to wait for everything to finish
[12:21:39] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ jugglinmike
[12:21:40] <b-ot> jugglinmike: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:21:54] <Tomashe> hmm i see
[12:21:57] <Tomashe> let me try it
[12:22:02] <jugglinmike> Can someone help me use jQuery mobile from within an AMD project?
[12:22:21] <duch_kazatel> jugglinmike dude... ask the question outright.
[12:22:59] <antihero> Hi, I'm having a problem with multi-column sortable. There is a second column, with plenty of height, but as soon as there are no items in it it can't be dragged-to.
[12:23:41] <Velveeta> absolute0: here's another update w/ some comments: http://jsfiddle.net/6t2uS/9/
[12:23:51] <duch_kazatel> antihero mind creating a fiddle?
[12:24:19] <duch_kazatel> aaah i just want this kegbot all ready!
[12:24:20] <Gu_______> anyone know how to make a url with a value example website.com/form.html?value=2 to select a specific dropdown? http://bpaste.net/show/GZNSEA8JGC1xu5E16bnG/
[12:24:30] <antihero> Not sure how I'd do this exactly seeing as there's a crapload of assets and whatnot
[12:24:48] <duch_kazatel> antihero and you can't make a minimal test case showcasing what you're doing?
[12:24:58] <duch_kazatel> Gu_______ you're just looking to parse the URL?
[12:25:11] <Velveeta> antihero: have you tried setting a min-height on the containers?
[12:25:11] <antihero> hmm
[12:25:13] <Tomashe> your way isnt working aswell Duch
[12:25:25] <antihero> Velveeta: Yep, they are there if I inspect them too
[12:25:26] <Velveeta> if all of their contents are emptied out, they'll be reduced to height: 0
[12:25:36] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe share your updated code?
[12:25:37] <Gu_______> yes but to also select the <select value="x"></slect>
[12:25:40] <duch_kazatel> Gu_______ http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[12:25:42] <duch_kazatel> start with this.
[12:25:46] <Velveeta> hmmm, then i don't know, that was my initial thought :)
[12:26:14] <antihero> They are generated by some awful react code, as you have to do a workaround because react sees the DOM as write only
[12:26:18] <Tomashe> wait
[12:26:21] <Absolute0> Velveeta: thanks for the help
[12:26:33] <Velveeta> absolute0: did you understand all of that sorcery?
[12:26:45] <antihero> it's been a very long afternoon.
[12:26:50] <duch_kazatel> antihero we only care about the final rendered result.  but either way it's hard to help.
[12:26:56] <duch_kazatel> and what's this about react and a read-only dom?
[12:27:05] <Velveeta> write-only*
[12:27:10] <antihero> duch_kazatel: Well React syncs from it's virtual dom -> Browser dom
[12:27:11] <Absolute0> Velveeta: isn't there an alternative to when that waits for all fails/successes?
[12:27:15] <Absolute0> Velveeta: somewhat...
[12:27:15] <Tomashe> actually its exacly like u dod
[12:27:16] <Tomashe> did
[12:27:23] <antihero> if browser dom is mutated, react goes nuts, as that's contrary to how stuff should work
[12:27:27] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe share me what you have.
[12:27:38] <Absolute0> Velveeta: when doesn't handle all success if a fail occurs, so you're making sure that it does.
[12:27:43] <antihero> so you have to do a mad thing where you treat the sorted stuff as a "leaf" node and then generate the stuff inside that using jQuery
[12:27:44] <Velveeta> absolute0: nope, that goes against the spec for promises... jquery does deviate from the spec in some ways, but not in that regard
[12:27:59] <Tomashe> Cannot call method 'HandleServicesList' of undefined
[12:28:02] <antihero> it's messy but is the only way.
[12:28:06] <Velveeta> when acting w/ a list of promises, they're considered related and essential to the task at hand, so they fail with the first failure, or they pass when all pass
[12:28:10] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe you still cannot do that.
[12:28:21] <Tomashe> but i copy paste what u gave me
[12:28:27] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe servicesList = GetServicesList().HandleServicesList(servicesList);
[12:28:31] <duch_kazatel> this will not work.
[12:28:31] <Velveeta> absolute0: right, that *is* the alternate to when that handles when *all* have completed :D
[12:28:41] <Tomashe> omg whats wrong with it now
[12:28:42] <Velveeta> at least as far as i know, but let me do a quick google just to make sure i'm not giving you false info
[12:28:51] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe the same thing that's been wrong./
[12:29:15] <Tomashe> im getting insane here. what do i do wrong
[12:29:42] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe you cannot chgain methods like that if you don't modify the prototype for all functions.  you do not want to do that.
[12:29:44] <Absolute0> Velveeta: I feel like a map call would clean up that code a bit.
[12:30:09] <antihero> I'll ask the react people
[12:30:17] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe it'll look something like this http://jsfiddle.net/sQcqq/3/
[12:30:34] <duch_kazatel> your you'll do what i showed you earlier where you pass a function to another function.
[12:30:54] <Gu_______> i think that regex stuff is a bit complicated
[12:31:19] <duch_kazatel> Gu_______ it really isn't.
[12:31:44] <Gu_______> i am looking for a super none flexible easy solution for selecting a particular option of a dropdown, it can be it's value or anything as the anchor
[12:32:19] <duch_kazatel> Gu_______ are you asking somebody to make this for you?  or for help in creating it?
[12:32:27] <Velveeta> absolute0: yeah it looks like there's nothing you can do with $.when to make it wait for both successes and failures of a list to complete, except for something similar to what i showed you: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5518181/jquery-deferreds-when-and-the-fail-callback-arguments
[12:32:45] <Velveeta> this person (response just below the accepted answer) wrote a $.whenAll function to do something similar
[12:34:13] <Tomashe> servicesList = GetServicesList().done(HandleServicesList(data));
[12:34:15] <Tomashe> what about that ?
[12:34:23] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe no.
[12:34:26] <duch_kazatel> still no go.
[12:35:03] <Tomashe> GetServicesList() { var list = $.ajax.... return list;
[12:35:10] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe ...
[12:35:16] <Tomashe> so i got the deffer and then pass by done
[12:35:33] <duch_kazatel> alright man do whatever works for you i guess.
[12:35:57] <Tomashe> its not working heheh
[12:36:03] <Tomashe> im can not find a solution so im trying
[12:36:09] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe i gave you a soluting.
[12:36:11] <duch_kazatel> but whatever.
[12:36:14] <duch_kazatel> *solution.
[12:36:15] <duch_kazatel> enjoy man.
[12:36:30] <Tomashe> u did not
[12:36:34] <Tomashe> what solution did u gave me ?!?
[12:36:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm not pasting it again.
[12:36:47] <Velveeta> the jsfiddle you posted returned servicesList, which would be undefined at the time
[12:36:56] <Velveeta> you should return $.ajax(...stuff...); instead
[12:37:06] <Velveeta> that way you can chain off of it in that deferred fashion
[12:38:02] <duch_kazatel> either do that, or have your functions return the values.  make a choice.  but your first example will never work.
[12:38:13] <Tomashe> hmm
[12:38:15] <Tomashe> ohh isee
[12:38:24] <Tomashe> ok i will test
[12:39:23] <Tomashe> actually i change it all into 2 functin with .done
[12:39:51] <Tomashe> but its still undefined
[12:40:00] <Tomashe> servicesList = GetServicesList();
[12:40:13] <Tomashe> just made the same function to return the html varible
[12:40:34] <Tomashe> but still undefine. now im totaly confused duch ...
[12:40:47] <Velveeta> show us an updated fiddle link
[12:41:27] <duch_kazatel> Gu_______ you never did get back to me.
[12:41:31] <duch_kazatel> where should we start?
[12:41:53] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/sQcqq/4/
[12:42:21] <duch_kazatel> brb lunch
[12:42:32] <Gu_______> i tried i have no idea how to ping you
[12:42:37] <Gu_______> plus it says i cant pm you
[12:42:42] <Gu_______> im new to irc
[12:42:46] <duch_lunch> you do it in the channel, man.
[12:42:48] <Velveeta> tomashe: you're not returning anything from your GetServicesList function, so when you do 'servicesList = GetServicesList()', servicesList is going to be undefined
[12:42:50] <duch_lunch> this isn't hard ;)
[12:42:54] <Velveeta> you want something like this instead (editing)
[12:43:12] <Gu_______> problem is, i dont understand it
[12:43:25] <duch_lunch> Gu_______ what about the thing i just sent you don't you understand?
[12:44:12] <Absolute0> Velveeta: deferred.resolve means to wait for pass/fail?
[12:44:23] <Gu_______> like, syntax
[12:44:28] <Velveeta> tomashe: http://jsfiddle.net/sQcqq/5/
[12:44:33] <Gu_______> does it create these categories on the fly?
[12:44:38] <Gu_______> such as category=4
[12:44:40] <duch_lunch> "categories"?
[12:44:45] <Gu_______> in your example
[12:44:51] <Gu_______> http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[12:44:59] <duch_lunch> did you look at the thing I PMed you?
[12:45:02] <duch_lunch> http://jsfiddle.net/W62ku/
[12:45:04] <duch_lunch> this.
[12:45:12] <Velveeta> absolute0: deferred.resolve means pass, deferred.reject means fail, but when using $.when, the first failure will fail the whole thing and cause its fail() and always() callbacks to execute immediately, whereas done() and always() will wait for the whole list to complete successfully before firing
[12:45:16] <duch_lunch> which is an implementation of the other link.
[12:45:33] <Velveeta> so that's why we create a separate list which is always resolved as successful, to force $.when to wait for all of them to finish one way or the other
[12:45:40] <duch_lunch> i'm going to step away to grab food.  i'll be back in a bit.
[12:45:53] <Velveeta> and then, individually, we don't care if the requests pass or fail, we resolve our separate deferred object that's tracking it
[12:46:42] <Velveeta> tomashe: whoops, i left an extra 'return' in that last fiddle, look at this one instead: http://jsfiddle.net/sQcqq/6/
[12:51:43] <Velveeta> duch walks away for lunch and the whole room dies
[12:54:32] <duch_lunch> back
[12:54:36] <duch_lunch> well yeah basically.
[12:54:44] <duch_lunch> THIS PLACE DIES WITHOUT ME.  JERKS.
[12:55:19] <Velveeta> ok everybody, he's back! give us your tired, your poor, your huddled bugs!

[12:55:41] <Velveeta> yes, precious.. bugses
[12:58:05] <Velveeta> i keep misaligning myself on this keyboard, because i've been using it for the last 5+ years, and a third of the keys are worn smooth, and the little bumps on the F and J to denote the home row are nearly worn away
[12:58:21] <Velveeta> i would get myself a new keyboard, but i'm convinced that i can wear all of the keys smooth eventually
[12:58:51] <duch_lunch> i have a 10+ year old microsoft "internet keyboard".  the keys are still barely worn, and the bump for "f" is only partially rubbed off.

[13:12:26] <duch_lunch> love spotify.
[13:12:31] <grafi> or something else
[13:12:32] <grafi> ...
[13:12:38] <grafi> i bought a macbook today
[13:12:40] <Velveeta> i'm not a mac person, i just went by reviews and popularity ;)
[13:12:42] <grafi> i need to know :D
[13:12:45] <grafi> i see
[13:12:46] <grafi> ^^
[13:12:55] <Velveeta> my previous laptop was running colloquy
[13:12:58] <duch_lunch> that makes you a "mac person"
[13:13:01] <duch_lunch> (jokes)
[13:13:02] <alaing> grafi congrats
[13:13:03] <ankurk_> Mac is awesome!
[13:13:07] <Velveeta> figured i'd switch it up when they issued me my new one
[13:13:15] <grafi> so far it has not been a good experience ^^
[13:13:22] <alaing> why?
[13:13:24] <grafi> and the thing is not even out of the shop
[13:13:27] <grafi> xD
[13:13:55] <duch_lunch> we have almost all mac devs here.  i partially run windows because i'd rather dev ON windows and catch all those fun bugs before testing in a VM.
[13:14:08] <grafi> basically the online shop were i bought it now says that its not available until april
[13:14:11] <grafi> which sucks
[13:14:11] <grafi> ._.
[13:14:33] <Velveeta> duch: i have to run on a mac because we have to test mac browsers also, and while i can run windows in a VM on this thing, it violates the apple eula to run osx on a windows laptop
[13:14:45] <grafi> hm
[13:14:50] <Velveeta> i suppose i could bootcamp it or something, but nah
[13:14:56] <grafi> i wonder if apple did that on purpose
[13:14:56] <grafi> xD
[13:15:10] <Velveeta> if they did, it was genius
[13:15:13] <duch_lunch> Velveeta we support both platforms here, too, but i rarely have issues in OSX versions of browsers.  plus IE is our big money maker.
[13:15:14] <grafi> probably
[13:15:25] <grafi> sucks to be you
[13:15:31] <duch_lunch> nah i don't mind.
[13:15:32] <Velveeta> duch: same with us, on both counts
[13:15:34] <duch_lunch> IE is easy for me.
[13:15:43] <Velveeta> but we're finally about to drop support for 7
[13:15:43] <grafi> ie6
[13:15:45] <grafi> <:
[13:15:52] <duch_lunch> Velveeta niiice.
[13:16:01] <Velveeta> if only we could have convinced them to just go ahead and drop 8 (and maybe 9) along with it
[13:16:10] <grafi> yeah
[13:16:10] <duch_lunch> we do back to 8 right now.
[13:16:12] <Velveeta> then i could start rewriting our jquery widget library in polymer or something instead :D
[13:16:17] <grafi> :D
[13:16:18] <duch_lunch> hahahaha
[13:16:22] <grafi> polymer
[13:16:31] <grafi> idk
[13:16:34] <grafi> its looks cool
[13:16:39] <Velveeta> you can stop there
[13:16:39] <grafi> but im not convinced
[13:16:40] <duch_lunch> we're actually big enough that a full rewrite is a terrible idea for us.
[13:16:40] <grafi> xD
[13:16:55] <grafi> do it anyways
[13:17:04] <Velveeta> well, for my particular product, we just pump out reusable components for our products to consume
[13:17:20] <duch_lunch> we got close recently.  we merged a couple codebases together which meant rewriting HUGE swaths of code.
[13:17:22] <Velveeta> so far as we provided a consistent functional interface, it wouldn't matter if they were built on the factory or something else
[13:17:22] <duch_lunch> it was a nightmare.
[13:17:47] <grafi> when is merging codebases ever fun
[13:17:48] <grafi> :P
[13:17:50] <Velveeta> although i wouldn't go through the trouble of mimicking the factory's interface in its entirety, so they'd still have to refactor somewhat at the product level
[13:19:02] <duch_lunch> if you have smart product guys, that shouldn't be too terrible.
[13:20:00] <grafi> _if_
[13:20:15] <Velveeta> we have a pretty top notch FEE team here
[13:20:50] <Velveeta> and we do a lot of internal education here to bring them all up together
[13:20:59] <duch_lunch> good
[13:21:17] <Velveeta> we've had FEE 101 and 201 series that some of us architects ran, for the lower level FEE's, and for some of the back end people that were interested in learning
[13:21:39] <grafi> sounds awesome
[13:21:52] <Velveeta> and i'm about to launch an old thing i used to do for just the FEEs on my own team, that's an expanded education series, but roll it out to everybody in the company vs just my team this time around
[13:22:09] <duch_lunch> that's awesome.
[13:22:18] <duch_lunch> good to see other devs doing the educational thing.
[13:22:20] <drej> well if it isnt captain awesome over here
[13:22:26] <Velveeta> yeah, it looks good on a perf review if you can say you helped increase the skills of *lots* of people, that's a multiplier effect on productivity :)
[13:22:38] <drej> speaking of education, i got the greenlight yesterday to do a 10 week workshop
[13:22:47] <drej> at a non profit tech education place
[13:23:05] <duch_lunch> we're working through clean code at my place and getting more strict about standards.
[13:23:15] <ankurk_> drej: When is it starting?
[13:23:23] <drej> in late june / early july
[13:23:28] <drej> have to do the curriculum now
[13:23:33] <Velveeta> i couldn't get this uploaded fast enough to stay relevant with drej's captain awesome comment, but i'm not gonna waste it regardless :D http://i.imgur.com/r7IAEoY.gif
[13:23:45] <drej> haha
[13:23:46] <duch_lunch> well done.
[13:23:55] <duch_lunch> Velveeta ++
[13:24:01] <duch_lunch> we need a karma module for the bot :(
[13:24:42] <Velveeta> yeah, i'd like to see a lot more pushing of education by the people who r doin it rite
[13:24:49] <Velveeta> there are plenty of horrible examples out there
[13:24:54] <ankurk_> drej: I think you told me about this. Where it will be happening?
[13:25:00] <drej> ankurk_ in toronto
[13:25:02] <drej> theymc.com
[13:25:11] <drej> its the same people that organized jqueryTO
[13:25:12] <Velveeta> and there's plenty of misinformation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu1KZGr9Isg
[13:25:38] <ankurk_> Well, I really want to join it :D
[13:25:53] <Velveeta> that video link should have been this video link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e1zzna-dNw&list=TL10N6AM_GrPyHJiVRPGt1RqyuJUMAw2Qh
[13:25:54] <drej> ankurk_ anyone can join it, its $500 for the series, or $75 per session
[13:25:59] <duch_lunch> Velveeta that dude is.. interesting.
[13:26:08] <drej> i'll probably spam it around once its up on theymc.com
[13:26:30] <duch_lunch> Velveeta yeah this node video is terrible.
[13:26:37] <Velveeta> nodejs is built on a bunch of lies!
[13:27:15] <duch_lunch> i feel like he's either trolling, or he's got a very strange mental model of the universe and anything he doesn't properly comprehend is wrong.
[13:27:40] <ankurk_> drej: ahh any discount for students?
[13:27:44] <Tomashe> Velveeta: hmm
[13:27:53] <drej> ankurk_ yes there will be, but not sure how much yet
[13:28:04] <Velveeta> duch: i'm thinking the latter ;)
[13:28:07] <drej> the point is not to make a ton of money off this, but to cover costs
[13:28:08] <duch_lunch> hahahaha
[13:28:12] <drej> of the venue and such
[13:28:26] <Velveeta> there are too many people out there with the opinion that "i don't understand, therefore it's dumb"
[13:28:32] <duch_lunch> Velveeta EXACTLY
[13:28:38] <drej> that statement is dumb
[13:28:43] <duch_lunch> or "I personally don't do it that way - you are an idiot"
[13:28:54] <Velveeta> ONE IMPLEMENTATION TO RULE THEM ALL
[13:29:04] <duch_lunch> exactly.
[13:29:05] <duch_lunch> jesus
[13:29:13] <drej> in every workshop i do and teach; i always push the idea to ask "why" and that even the techniques i'm teaching them, they shouldnt take at face value
[13:29:20] <duch_lunch> i want to start a sort of "hacker collective" that pushes that sort of shit.
[13:29:20] <drej> the fact is, there are as many solutions to a problem as there are developers you can throw at it
[13:29:23] <drej> some are more right than others, of course
[13:29:29] <ankurk_> drej: I understand, hopefully I will be able to join
[13:29:31] <drej> but the point is to engage people enough to start asking WHY
[13:29:37] <Velveeta> "real time, well, it's javascript so... it's not gonna be as real time as some other things out there" -- he makes it sound like every javascript interaction takes seconds to minutes to process and return
[13:29:39] <drej> and taking the explanations as to why something is the way it is
[13:29:48] <duch_lunch> Velveeta right?
[13:30:00] <Velveeta> tomashe: was there a question?
[13:30:07] <ankurk_> I am usually shy at public gatherings
[13:30:19] <duch_lunch> ankurk_ don't be.
[13:30:32] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:30:38] <Tomashe> Velveeta: its returning me an object
[13:30:43] <Tomashe> instead of the html
[13:30:46] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: It's very easy to turn off shyness.
[13:30:50] <ankurk_> I always think if I am going to ask a question, hope it is not stupid
[13:31:03] <Velveeta> drej: right, we just went through submitting our self reviews and peer reviews for performance review time, and one of the things i found myself telling people in the "any other comments you'd give them?" section was "read everything you can get your hands on, and play with as many frameworks as you can (even the ugly ones <coughs angular>), they all have something to offer that you can incorporate into your own dev patterns"
[13:31:18] <duch_lunch> ankurk_ nah, ask the question.  always.  no reason to feel stupid.  that you have that idea means you're doing the right things.
[13:31:26] <Velveeta> tomashe: what is, the getservices function or the callback in the done function?
[13:31:50] <Velveeta> ankurk_: i'm usually shy at public gatherings too, until i drink enough liquid courage
[13:31:59] <drej> im a natural public speaker
[13:32:03] <BillCriswell> Beer really is the answer to everything.
[13:32:07] <Velveeta> truly
[13:32:07] <Tomashe> as u can see i nee the html as u put it in the resolve
[13:32:16] <synth_> beer me pls
[13:32:22] <duch_lunch> ooh tomorrow is beer day at work.
[13:32:24] <duch_lunch> win win win
[13:32:26] <Velveeta> tomashe: right, and that's what should be coming through in the done function
[13:32:38] <BillCriswell> I want to take a nap big time right now.
[13:32:39] <Tomashe> i see
[13:32:40] <Velveeta> tomashe: what object is coming through?
[13:32:46] <ankurk_> I would try to overcome going to more public gatherings :D
[13:32:52] <Tomashe> i guess its the deffere
[13:32:52] <ankurk_> Beer Day? Awesome!
[13:32:54] <synth_> our company stocks our fridge with beers daily
[13:33:00] <Velveeta> drej: i'm not a natural speaker, but i gotta swallow that when the time comes
[13:33:09] <Tomashe> deferred.resolve(html);  < what exactly that do?
[13:33:17] <BillCriswell> I'm not even a natural private speaker
[13:33:19] <Velveeta> what helps is the realization that this isn't 3rd grade, and the people that are there to see you speak are there because they actually are interested in what you have to say
[13:33:28] <duch_lunch> yeah - "weekly wins".  go out to the patio, write a thing you did on the whiteboard, and grab beer from the keg.
[13:33:43] <Velveeta> tomashe: that means 'execute all of the callbacks i attached with .done(), and pass 'html' as the value they receive'
[13:34:27] <Tomashe> ok so how do i get the value of html in here
[13:34:37] <Tomashe> servicesList = GetServicesList().done(function(data){ i want to get the html we resolve });
[13:34:38] <Velveeta> you receive it in the callback passed to .done()
[13:34:46] <Tomashe> so data is the html ?
[13:34:49] <Velveeta> yes
[13:34:52] <Tomashe> but its not
[13:35:04] <Tomashe> when i do console.log(servicesList); i get an object
[13:35:13] <Tomashe> it should be html
[13:35:15] <duch_kazatel> lol @ the jquery homepage right now http://i.imgur.com/5DalwpG.png
[13:35:18] <Velveeta> well, that's because you're outputting servicesList and not data
[13:35:35] <Velveeta> in my jsfiddle example, you'll see the .done() callback receives servicesList as a parameter
[13:35:36] <BillCriswell> Fuck it. Do it live!
[13:35:39] <Tomashe> servicesList = GetServicesList().done(function(data){ return data }); console.log(servicesList);
[13:35:45] <Tomashe> thats my actual code
[13:35:51] <Velveeta> that's not the code i posted for you
[13:35:59] <Tomashe> yes i changed it
[13:36:02] <Velveeta> you shouldn't have
[13:36:08] <Velveeta> the code i posted would have worked :D
[13:36:10] <duch_kazatel> guys
[13:36:11] <duch_kazatel> http://doge2048.com/
[13:36:15] <duch_kazatel> such game
[13:36:17] <Velveeta> oh.. my... god..
[13:36:32] <Tomashe> but its the same code only with the return data and console.log(servicesList);
[13:36:32] <duch_kazatel> so tiles
[13:36:33] <duch_kazatel> wow
[13:37:10] <BillCriswell> Well... this is a 2048 remake I can get behind.
[13:37:16] <ankurk_> this game looks so 1990
[13:37:30] <duch_kazatel> lol wait so tomashe is looking for help, then you give him code, and then he doesn't actually use it and complains it doesn't work?
[13:37:43] <Tomashe> omg let me show u the code
[13:38:23] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/sQcqq/7/
[13:38:30] <Tomashe> this is what im using at the moment its the same structure!
[13:38:43] <Velveeta> tomashe: it's the same structure except for the part where you broke it
[13:38:52] <Tomashe> and where is that/
[13:38:56] <duch_kazatel> "it's the same code but i changed it"
[13:39:02] <Tomashe> nop i did not change it
[13:39:14] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/sQcqq/8/
[13:39:16] <BillCriswell> html = html +?
[13:39:19] <Velveeta> you *did* change it
[13:39:30] <Velveeta> you moved the asynchronous bit out and treated it synchronously, which it's not
[13:39:54] <Tomashe> let me see
[13:40:14] <Velveeta> the whole nature of ajax is that it's *asynchronous* javascript and xml
[13:40:25] <Velveeta> you can't issue an ajax call and expect its response to be available immediately
[13:40:30] <Velveeta> it has to make that round trip to the server
[13:40:46] <BillCriswell> That code needs var html = ''; somewhere or you'll get some undefined action.
[13:40:47] <Velveeta> so you use the deferred promises to tell your code when the server has responded, and then you work with the response inside of that callback block
[13:41:13] <Velveeta> i'll leave the global references in play for the purposes of just explaining async code
[13:41:28] <Velveeta> they're..... out of.... <stifles a laugh> scope?
[13:41:33] <Velveeta> ahhhhhhhahahahahahaha i kill me!
[13:41:45] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[13:41:51] <duch_kazatel> oh mans.  *golf clap*
[13:41:59] <Tomashe> if i get it right it should be GetServicesList().done(function(data){ servicesList =  data });
[13:43:32] <Velveeta> sure, you can set servicesList equal to data, but it still won't be available to console.log outside of that scope
[13:43:41] <Velveeta> because the code outside of that block will execute prior to that block
[13:43:49] <Velveeta> that's the nature of asynchronous code, it executes out of order
[13:44:26] <Tomashe> yes thats why i added var servicesList; in global scope
[13:44:46] <duch_kazatel> the ajaxed-in content is fetched in order, but the js engine doesn't site and wait for the request to complete.
[13:45:09] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you'd have this awesome thing where a user does something and the browser stops for a few seconds.
[13:45:37] <Tomashe> :)
[13:45:41] <Tomashe> thanks for the help guys
[13:47:16] <Velveeta> how the hell am i supposed to figure out my current highest tile on this doge 2048 game?
[13:47:22] <Velveeta> i wonder if the markup holds a clue
[13:47:32] <duch_kazatel> the only winning move is not to play
[13:47:33] <Velveeta> yep, ok, up to 512
[13:49:34] <jigglebilly83> wc
[13:50:19] <duch_kazatel> cw
[13:50:52] <drej> Mâ†ƒ
[13:51:13] <duch_kazatel> ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
[13:51:35] <duch_kazatel> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[13:52:10] <ankurk_> it's first day of spring here, and it still feels like winter
[13:52:26] <duch_kazatel> really?  where are you?
[13:52:32] <duch_kazatel> because here it's feeling pretty spring-ish
[13:52:44] <BillCriswell> Aren't you in cali?
[13:52:51] <duch_kazatel> northern cali, yeah
[13:52:56] <duch_kazatel> where we have no water.
[13:52:56] <jigglebilly83> spring like here in KC
[13:52:58] <ankurk_> Toronto :D
[13:53:12] <ankurk_> East Coast sucks actually
[13:53:19] <duch_kazatel> pretty soon my state will just be on fire.
[13:53:26] <Velveeta> apring here in central texas :D
[13:53:31] <Velveeta> lol duch
[13:53:40] <duch_kazatel> you anywhere near Austin, Velveeta?
[13:53:42] <lyles> it has been spring here in florida :)
[13:53:49] <Velveeta> deep in the heart of it, as it were
[13:53:55] <duch_kazatel> lyles florida is perpetual balmy hot.
[13:53:56] <ankurk_> Fire? how high temp gets in your place?
[13:54:05] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ my area gets up into the 110s
[13:54:09] <lyles> not when low 70s are chilly ;)
[13:54:25] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ also: california is in the middle of a HUGE drought
[13:55:08] <ankurk_> hmm, same as back home India, there it can touch 52 Degree Celsius
[13:55:37] <Velveeta> duch: you know people in austin or what?
[13:55:57] <drej> ankurk_ it just started snowing
[13:55:59] <duch_kazatel> i am obsessed with SRV, so austin is a kind of mecca for me.
[13:56:10] <drej> ankurk_ we both live in toronto, and i used to live in india too
[13:56:20] <ankurk_> I miss India actually
[13:56:26] <ankurk_> ahh snoqw
[13:56:27] <ankurk_> *snow
[13:56:30] <ankurk_> not again
[13:56:46] <drej> yeah ive been meaning to go back to india, but havent gotten a chance
[13:56:56] <drej> i lived there in '89-92
[13:57:12] <Velveeta> my ex stepmom got to go to a few NA meetings where SRV was present :D
[13:57:24] <duch_kazatel> oh shit.  i'll bet that was a little weird.
[13:57:27] <Velveeta> i didn't start listening to him until a few years ago, but yeah, he's definitely one of the greats :D
[13:57:38] <duch_kazatel> i have a tattoo, so i would have to agree >.>
[13:58:16] <Velveeta> i want tattoos.. but i also want no pain.. also, i'm kind of a pussy about needles..
[13:58:19] <ankurk_> India was awesome in 90s
[13:58:26] <Velveeta> and by 'kind of' i mean 'very much'
[13:58:31] <drej> ankurk_ do you know the maruti suzuki cars?
[13:58:36] <duch_kazatel> do it.  it's pretty awesome.
[13:58:54] <duch_kazatel> after the first 5 minutes, it's fine.
[13:58:58] <ankurk_> drej: my dad used to own 800 for 12 years :D
[13:59:08] <drej> ankurk_ my father was one of the key people that brought the production of those to the maruti factories in india
[13:59:18] <ankurk_> he still misses it, that thing use to give 22 km per litre
[13:59:34] <Velveeta> ha! metric!
[13:59:40] <Velveeta> i recognize those words!
[13:59:48] <ankurk_> Maruti is still one of best brands when it comes to cars
[13:59:49] <Velveeta> the meaning is lost on me.....
[14:00:01] <ankurk_> Metric is much better
[14:00:01] <drej> ankurk_ yup, prior to them existing, it was just the ambassador really
[14:00:16] <ankurk_> His first was a Fiat actually
[14:04:06] <velus> hello all can someone help me write a script, i need a script that can send data to to a file and get a response every 3 seconds or so?
[14:04:18] <velus> no 10s is best
[14:06:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:06:29] <duch_kazatel> "send data to a file" - this won't end well.
[14:06:50] <velus> im basically wanting a script using jquery that send something to a php script that will return somethign
[14:07:31] <duch_kazatel> you want $.ajax()
[14:07:36] <velus> ok
[14:15:36] <CrowX-> I have two ajax calls, one is putting a value in a mysql database, and the other is supposed to read the auto-incrementing index of that value's row. But sometimes the reading call is faster than the writing one, and it ends up not reading the correct index. Any idea how to solve this?
[14:16:03] <duch_kazatel> put the reading call in the done callback of the writing call.
[14:16:22] <duch_kazatel> or return the data in the response to your post or whatever.
[14:17:24] <velus> duch_kazatel: im basically wanting the script to collect aport number of a page send the port number to a php file that will send the port number to a class then the class returns a 0 or a 1 and the script to then change apart of the page to either on in green or off in red depending on the return how would i do this, it needs to do this every 10 seconds
[14:17:52] <duch_kazatel> velus why are you doing this every 10 seconds.
[14:17:53] <velus> the port number is set on the page it does not change but it can be added to though
[14:18:06] <velus> cos it is to check if somethign is on or off
[14:18:08] <duch_kazatel> once you set a port number on a page, it's set.
[14:18:25] <duch_kazatel> you can't change your port number without reloading the page
[14:18:27] <velus> the prot number dont need to be change just a little bit of text does
[14:18:50] <duch_kazatel> what is the text?
[14:18:53] <duch_kazatel> something you input?
[14:19:10] <duch_kazatel> basically, don't use timers - use eventds.
[14:19:12] <duch_kazatel> *events
[14:19:39] <duch_kazatel> that's another guide i should write: "don't use timers - use events"
[14:20:11] <velus> if the return is a 1 it needs to show on with green text or if its a 0 then it needs to show red off, but it needs to check it every 10 seconds, not just check once and show it every 10 seconds cos that part of the page never changes in the site
[14:20:40] <velus> so someone could be on the site for 7 hours but the port goes down, it wont show it on the page
[14:20:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:20:58] <duch_kazatel> oh, i get it - you want to monitor ports?
[14:21:04] <velus> yes
[14:21:04] <duch_kazatel> using javascript?
[14:21:08] <duch_kazatel> that's... not a good idea.
[14:21:09] <velus> yes
[14:21:11] <velus> and php
[14:21:47] <duch_kazatel> use the php to hit those ports and then setup a push framework or something.
[14:22:01] <velus> the java script only sends the port number to the js then that sends it to the php and the php returns a reply
[14:22:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:22:31] <duch_kazatel> you've got this architected all wrong.
[14:22:37] <duch_kazatel> let's back up - why are you doing this?
[14:23:37] <Velveeta> damnit! i had all the proper doge's out there, but couldn't get them aligned to collapse them all, yarrrrrr!
[14:23:49] <Velveeta> ok i'm out, get to go fight rush hour to pick up the kiddo
[14:23:55] <duch_kazatel> enjoy!
[14:25:31] <velus> i have a virtual world grid, the grid runs off a port number so people can log in and stuff, the website is on the normal port 80 the program runs off 8002 8003 9000 and much more but for the main page of the site i need to check port 8002 so the site can see if the grid is up or not, i have a page that will collect the port number from the js, the php file will send the information to a class the class will return 1 or 0
[14:26:29] <duch_kazatel> velus why not do what most places to and just run your check on pageload?
[14:28:00] <duch_kazatel> the entire exercize seems really strange.  if you're really itching to do this the way you've architected it in your nead, look at $.ajax() and setTimeout()
[14:28:42] <velus> because my site is set up with a few parts the header the main content the side bar and footer, the only bit that changes when someone clicks on any page after startig the site will be the main content the gid status is on the side bar so wont change the whole time they are on the site
[14:30:01] <duch_kazatel> also: look into using sockets.
[14:30:08] <duch_kazatel> or something similar.
[14:31:38] <velus> i have looked into sockets i am with php i have the class for php to check the socket and reply with a 1 or a 0
[14:34:13] <systemfault> velus: How is that even close to be related to jQuery?
[14:34:40] <velus> cos i thought it would need jquery for the every 10 seconds
[14:34:42] <duch_kazatel> systemfault he's looking for some guidance.  i wouldn't fault him in this case.
[14:34:57] <duch_kazatel> velus setTimeout() is a native javascript method.
[14:35:00] <duch_kazatel> but again, don't do it.
[14:36:14] <velus> how would i do it5 then
[14:36:26] <duch_kazatel> use something like sockets, or rethink your UX.
[14:37:09] <velus> i need it to see if the port in use
[14:37:54] <duch_kazatel> either way, $.ajax() and setTimeout() are the two things you'd need.
[14:37:57] <systemfault> What does he want to do?
[14:38:17] <duch_kazatel> he has some kind of bizarre UX that's checking ports.
[14:38:24] <duch_kazatel> no idea why but that's what he's doing.
[14:38:36] <duch_kazatel> he wants to hit his server to check every 10 seconds.
[14:38:56] <duch_kazatel> because the part of the page that has the info on it doesn't ever reload once you're on the site.
[14:39:39] <systemfault> What's wrong with hitting the server every 10 seconds?
[14:39:57] <duch_kazatel> it depends on how many users he'll have.
[14:39:57] <systemfault> If he does it properly using etags, it shouldn't be a problem
[14:40:11] <systemfault> The server will send 304s most of the time.
[14:40:28] <duch_kazatel> you think this guy understands how to do that?
[14:40:29] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[14:40:57] <velus> systemfault: im am basically wanting the site to show grid is (if the port is active show green online or if its not a red offline) its for a virtual world grid
[14:41:01] <systemfault> Time to learn!
[14:41:12] <duch_kazatel> "virtual world grid" of what?
[14:41:23] <velus> i could just have it do the check every 10 seonds and change when it goes onlien or ofline
[14:41:54] <velus> its a virtual world grid the program is opensim, its a virtual world and i am runnign it in grid mode not standalone
[14:43:02] <duch_kazatel> and you're making a server monitor of some kind?
[14:44:31] <velus> it doesnt have a web based server monitor thats why i am creating one in php and js, it just checks if the port 8002 is in use or not, if in use then it will return 1 and if not a 0 which i neec the js to check it and get the reply and then it will need to be able to show green or red
[14:44:53] <duch_kazatel> lol you've repeated that last part about a dozen times now.
[14:44:59] <duch_kazatel> i pointed you in a direction.
[14:46:09] <sergey> I have some script which set height: 39px!important to element. How can I override it?
[14:46:21] <duch_kazatel> sergey with jquery?
[14:46:25] <sergey> yes
[14:46:34] <duch_kazatel> sergey .css('height', '40px');
[14:46:42] <duch_kazatel> on the element itself.
[14:47:00] <systemfault> velus: Ok... So the next step is to define a map datastructure in PHP.... key => value
[14:47:31] <systemfault> velus: The key could be the name of the server... the value could be anything... a string (offline/online) or a boolean
[14:47:49] <systemfault> velus: Then your PHP script would echo it json_encoded
[14:48:00] <sergey> duch_kazatel: It is, but I have to wait when first script set height then my script shout override it
[14:49:01] <systemfault> velus: Seriously... don't explain us the useless details... just tell us what you need to do
[14:49:05] <velus> yes i know that systemfault i have done all the php bit but i need help with the js part
[14:49:12] <systemfault> velus: It doesn't help us to know that you need to poll port 8002
[14:49:49] <systemfault> velus: Ok, so now you got a url to get the current status of your servers?
[14:50:10] <duch_kazatel> sergey huh?
[14:50:17] <systemfault> velus: Then just use $.getJSON to get the data every 10 seconds.
[14:51:00] <duch_kazatel> sergey if you set it using .css(), you're fine.
[14:52:48] <Getty> i must say: http://garann.github.io/template-chooser/ is not really helpful ;)
[14:53:36] <duch_kazatel> Getty hah i was using that recently too!
[14:53:38] <Getty> come on people, drop out what js template engine you suggest! lets see whats the trend ;)
[14:53:41] <sergey> duch_kazatel: Here is whole page http://pastebin.com/HtPkmUe7 I need to make pinit counter height like others counters
[14:53:49] <duch_kazatel> Getty you won't get much help with that in here.
[14:54:04] <Getty> i really tend to underscore most, i would actually prefer EJS but its now so old, i doubt it works fine enough
[14:54:18] <duch_kazatel> sergey can you setup a working jsfiddle instead.
[14:54:28] <sergey> duch_kazatel: sure
[14:54:31] <Getty> duch_kazatel: i dont need help, i need suggestions ;) i dont wanna feel i miss something or that i dont look at something deep enough
[14:54:57] <duch_kazatel> Getty sorry - let me rephrase: you're in a channel about jquery.  lots of folks here don't concern themselves much with templating engines.
[14:54:58] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[14:55:16] <Getty> duch_kazatel: yeah and i dont mind those ;) but look... we are 824 here
[14:55:18] <Getty> ;)
[14:55:27] <Getty> damn it, i was here when it was 50
[14:55:29] <duch_kazatel> still off-topic, but whatever.
[14:55:54] <Getty> dont tell me there are still people pushing off-topic policy on here? that was what killed the channels activity in the first place ;)
[14:56:11] <sergey> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/fWm9Y/
[14:56:13] <Getty> which is still funny as it was introduced by people who are not here anymore at all ;)
[14:56:32] <duch_kazatel> Getty you're confused still.  i'm saying that you will probably have a hard time getting much feedback on it here.  that's all.
[14:56:45] <Getty> duch_kazatel: i still try! :D
[14:57:26] <Jon47> there may not be a better forum on IRC to ask about js templating engines in general
[14:57:36] <Jon47> though i'm sure if you pick a specific one you can find a channel for it
[14:57:42] <Getty> Jon47: that for sure ;)
[14:57:46] <duch_kazatel> node.js might be a better place for it.
[14:57:48] <Getty> Jon47: there is always a biatched group
[14:57:53] <Getty> oh no... thats totally not a better place ;)
[14:58:13] <duch_kazatel> just a suggestion man.
[14:58:19] <Getty> i would prefer to try to pick out my eye with a spoon! hehe ;)
[14:58:28] <duch_kazatel> why do you keep sending me winky faces?
[14:58:36] <Getty> i like winky faces!
[14:58:37] <Jon47> and fwiw my company uses pre-compiled Handlebars, serving only the runtime to clients, and it's pretty badass
[14:58:56] <Getty> Jon47: thanks, at least a feedback
[14:59:12] <Getty> Jon47: my problem with handlebars and moustache is the logicless... i cant use my internationalization lib proper
[14:59:35] <Getty> Jon47: all solutions of how to localize in handlebars are not really practical for REAL translation (as in: they ignore language reality)
[14:59:38] <SlexAxton> you can just have an i18n helper
[14:59:42] <Getty> no
[14:59:44] <Getty> thats not enough
[14:59:54] <Getty> as saiD: all i18n helper concepts are wrong
[15:00:02] <SlexAxton> disagree
[15:00:03] <Getty> they are just working for a small amount of cases for internationalization
[15:00:10] <Getty> i can tell, i made it for bigger platforms
[15:00:15] <SlexAxton> same
[15:00:26] <Getty> so then tell me how you do cascaded stuff in handlebars
[15:00:28] <Getty> wait i give you example
[15:00:51] <duch_kazatel> Hey SlexAxton.  i dug your post a while back on inheritance in jS.
[15:01:11] <SlexAxton> thanks!
[15:01:25] <SlexAxton> https://github.com/jivesoftware/requirejs-messageformat as a plugin in handlebars
[15:01:31] <SlexAxton> backed by https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js
[15:01:48] <Getty> l('xxx %s.',r('<a href="">') ~ l("xxx") ~ r('</a>'))
[15:02:20] <Getty> hey wow, thats actually a solution
[15:02:34] <Getty> wait....
[15:02:43] <SlexAxton> i wrote about it here
[15:02:43] <SlexAxton> https://alexsexton.com/blog/2012/03/the-ux-of-language/
[15:02:48] <SlexAxton> if you'd like more info
[15:02:55] <SlexAxton> works very well
[15:03:09] <duch_kazatel> sergey woah, where'd you get that use of .css?
[15:03:40] <Getty> SlexAxton: so far i just had the topic outside of JS templates, i wrote that one ;) https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/blob/master/lib/DDG/Manual/Translation.pod
[15:04:15] <SlexAxton> yea all the gettext stuff is pretty limiting, agreed
[15:04:17] <SlexAxton> i wrote a lib for that too
[15:04:23] <Getty> SlexAxton: what i miss is the mixing of the HTML and the text, one example
[15:04:29] <SlexAxton> https://github.com/SlexAxton/jed
[15:04:30] <Getty> SlexAxton: like how you do that at all with handlebars?
[15:04:41] <Getty> my problem is not the gettext stuff
[15:04:55] <Getty> my problem is that i dont understand how i make that with handlebar (or mustache) with cascading text
[15:05:06] <Getty> as it literally breaks the concept
[15:05:40] <Getty> i mean what you showed me with messageformat is a solution in JS yes, but i didnt saw an example (on flying over) how that is used in a bigger template in handlebar?
[15:05:50] <SlexAxton> {{#_ "key" data}}<a href="link">{val, plural, one{yyy} other{xxx} }</a>{{/_}}
[15:05:50] <Getty> you understand my logical problem?
[15:06:02] <Getty> wait wait....
[15:06:09] <Getty> lets make it real, ok?
[15:06:19] <SlexAxton> what's not real about that?
[15:06:34] <Getty> that i dotn understand what you produce ;) let me give you the case i wanna see as template:
[15:07:02] <sergey> duch_kazatel: Here is values I need to change https://www.dropbox.com/s/hzbs6rkhgxja24h/Screen%20Shot%202014-03-21%20at%2000.04.47.png
[15:07:13] <Getty> <div>this is a <a>Text</a>.</div> is what i want in the end but of course with the translation strings: "this is a %." and "Text"
[15:07:24] <duch_kazatel> sergey right - why not use .css('height', '40px') ?
[15:07:25] <Getty> (or whatever replacement character for %)
[15:07:38] <Getty> so that the <a></a> is in the template and not the in the translation string
[15:08:07] <SlexAxton> {{#_ "resultcount" results}}<a href="results/{id}">{count, plural, one{There is one result} other{There are # results.} }</a>{{/_}}
[15:08:15] <SlexAxton> or
[15:08:29] <Getty> wait then you make <a> </a> around the complete text
[15:08:35] <SlexAxton> <a href="results/{{results.id}}">{{#_ "resultcount" results}}{count, plural, one{There is one result} other{There are # results.} }{{/_}}</a>
[15:08:37] <Getty> see the detail: i just want the <a> tag around the "Text"
[15:08:41] <Getty> i dont want it around the rest
[15:08:45] <Getty> thats the exactly technical problem i mean
[15:08:53] <sergey> duch_kazatel: Because my script do its job before pinit. Thats why my script can't override height set by pinit
[15:08:54] <Getty> its not about the ln() case thats another problem, ok, i get your solution
[15:09:03] <SlexAxton> you want html completely removed from strings?
[15:09:05] <Getty> but what you do about cascaded text? when a part of the text is surrounded by HTML?
[15:09:14] <Getty> of course i dont want HTML in the strings
[15:09:17] <Getty> who does that?!?!?!
[15:09:25] <SlexAxton> that would take an annotation grammar about where the links should go
[15:09:27] <Getty> would be horrible, if translators could fuck it up hehe
[15:09:37] <Getty> he?
[15:09:38] <SlexAxton> no it just takes good tools for translators
[15:09:41] <Getty> i just make spitted tokens
[15:09:43] <duch_kazatel> sergey then use CSS?  i'm confused about what's going on.
[15:09:43] <Getty> its pretty simple
[15:09:48] <Getty> with plain gettext
[15:09:58] <SlexAxton> you can't split the tokens and always get good sentences
[15:10:03] <Getty> slexaxton: what??? really you mean you solve the handling of subparts of html inside the sentences?!
[15:10:05] <Getty> you can!!
[15:10:06] <Getty> lol
[15:10:09] <Getty> what?
[15:10:14] <Getty> for this you hvae the "context" in gettext
[15:10:27] <Getty> you group all tokens for one sentence in one context
[15:10:28] <SlexAxton> right, as long as you don't have more than one context
[15:10:30] <SlexAxton> it's fine
[15:10:35] <Getty> and then visual group them on the translation interface
[15:10:39] <SlexAxton> There are 5 results in 2 categories
[15:10:42] <Getty> yeah
[15:10:43] <Getty> still
[15:10:44] <Getty> no problem
[15:10:55] <Getty> i have much deeper and more complex situations (or had, i am not anymore at duckduckgo)
[15:11:01] <Getty> with gettext all no problem
[15:11:05] <SlexAxton> so your translators understand l('xxx %s.',r('<a href="">') ~ l("xxx") ~ r('</a>'))
[15:11:08] <Getty> yeah
[15:11:11] <SlexAxton> lol
[15:11:15] <Getty> yeah
[15:11:15] <SlexAxton> but they would mess up html
[15:11:16] <Getty> that works fine
[15:11:20] <Getty> they dont touch HTML
[15:11:26] <SlexAxton> mine don't either
[15:11:27] <SlexAxton> i pull it out
[15:11:28] <Getty> they just have 'xxx %s' and 'xxx'
[15:11:32] <Getty> he?
[15:11:35] <SlexAxton> and they translate what is linked
[15:11:38] <Getty> oh dear
[15:11:42] <Getty> dude, so you stack just workarounds
[15:11:45] <SlexAxton> lol
[15:11:47] <Getty> sorry, yeah no, thats why i dont wanan use handlebars
[15:11:49] <SlexAxton> gettext is from 1970
[15:11:52] <Getty> i dont wanna do creepy workarounds
[15:11:54] <Getty> gettext is FINE
[15:11:56] <SlexAxton> it has nothing to do with handlebars
[15:11:58] <Getty> the problem is NOT gettext
[15:12:03] <Getty> it has
[15:12:06] <Getty> as i can do it with anything esle?!?!?!
[15:12:07] <Getty> he?!?!?
[15:12:14] <SlexAxton> i could put {{#_}}('xxx %s.',r('<a href="">') ~ l("xxx") ~ r('</a>')){{/_}} in handlebars
[15:12:15] <Getty> my translation system UNDERSTANDS what i posted you above
[15:12:18] <SlexAxton> and do your thing in a second
[15:12:21] <Getty> AH!
[15:12:22] <Getty> thats waht i asked
[15:12:26] <Getty> cause there is NO example of this
[15:12:39] <Getty> so handlebar parses arrays out of the functions
[15:12:47] <Getty> i didnt found ONE example of a handlebar function with an array as parameter
[15:12:56] <Getty> that made it like impossible for me to think about a solution
[15:13:08] <SlexAxton> well, I do it with ICU Messageformat
[15:13:14] <SlexAxton> gettext is just a parsed grammar as well
[15:13:17] <SlexAxton> you can pull it out of the AST
[15:13:24] <Getty> oh dear so you take this inside the handlebar and its parsed on its own?
[15:13:33] <SlexAxton> i can't talk to you anymore
[15:13:38] <Getty> oh dear, yeah no, i dotn wanna do this, i have nice translation functions in javascript
[15:13:40] <Getty> i have gettext in js
[15:13:58] <Getty> i dont know why i shoudl do something that cant use it directly as supposed
[15:19:28] <Abbbbbbhi> Hello
[15:21:43] <duch_kazatel> hello
[15:22:03] <Abbbbbbhi> Question: I have iframe with following structure <iframe><html><body><div>Hello ajshdkas</div></body></html></iframe> how to automatically adjust the body height according to height of div (div height depends of text , so if inner text changes then its height changes)
[15:23:01] <duch_kazatel> check out the .content() method and the load event
[15:33:01] <Abbbbbbhi> duch - check this http://imgur.com/LvemVLU . if you look at the screen you would get better understanding
[15:33:34] <Abbbbbbhi> I want the body height = div height
[15:33:40] <duch_kazatel> Abbbbbbhi my advice still stands
[15:33:50] <duch_kazatel> check out the .content() method and the load event.
[15:34:18] <duch_kazatel> you want to wait for the iframe content to have loaded, then look at th iframe content through .content()
[15:34:27] <duch_kazatel> err, contents()
[15:34:29] <duch_kazatel> with an s
[15:35:04] <Abbbbbbhi> yaa I was able to do that
[15:40:19] <farn5w0rth>  how do i have multiple functions as part of my ajax success handler? $.ajax({........success: function1)}; function function1(){...} can i do like success: [function1, function2,...]?
[15:41:18] <duch_kazatel> .done(function(){ function1(); function2(); });
[15:41:31] <duch_kazatel> or create a single function and proxy everything through that.
[15:42:22] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: thank you :) is done and complete the same thing?
[15:42:59] <duch_kazatel> go check out the docs - .done() is the new .success()\
[15:43:51] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: ah :) thank you!
[15:51:51] <krisek101> I have a problem with ajax in jquery. How can I in "success : function(msg)" get variables from my php file? For example I have in php: $correct = true; or $correct = false; and I want in jquery check who variable is return.

[15:55:58] <krisek101> Look at the 18. line in jquery
[15:56:42] <vsmith> is there a jquery mobile irc?
[15:57:40] <systemfault> krisek101: you need to echo the response... something like : echo json_encode(array('result' => $correct));
[15:57:48] <systemfault> (My PHP is rusty... might be wrong)
[15:59:53] <krisek101> so, do I have to use json?
[16:01:56] <erming> krisek101, if a boolean value is all you want
[16:02:04] <erming> you can just check if the return is either "0" or "1"
[16:02:39] <erming> just as an example.. But if you want more kinds of values, yeah, JSON is good.. You can even use HTML and parse it with $("html here")
[16:04:33] <krisek101> Ah, ok. I have to learn it;D But now i need to just download that one variable.
[16:06:07] <krisek101> erming, how can I check that boolean is 0 or 1. In PHP only need to add: "return 0" or "return 1", yes?
[16:06:12] <erming> yep
[16:06:23] <erming> and then: if (msg == "1")
[16:06:41] <krisek101> ahh, ok, i try it
[16:07:10] <duch_kazatel> use === not ==
[16:13:13] <tucan> im not sure why but my jquery ui autocomplete list doesnt show, the ajax requests return the right data and 200 success OK so it should work
[16:13:25] <krisek101> It didn't work. Code behaves as if he did not check this condition.
[16:13:39] <tucan> does where jquery-ui.min.js included matter?
[16:13:45] <tucan> i put it before </body>
[16:14:48] <erming> krisek101: try to debug using alert(msg); and see what value pops up
[16:15:00] <erming> success: function(msg) { alert(msg); }
[16:15:17] <krisek101> ok
[16:16:17] <erming> an empty alert box means that your http-request was successful, but your PHP did not return anything
[16:18:02] <krisek101> alert(msg) returned correct info
[16:18:39] <krisek101> it returned communications from echo in mail.php
[16:19:23] <krisek101> <font color="green">E-mail was successfully sent</font>
[16:19:50] <erming> i thought you wanted to return "1" from your PHP
[16:20:02] <erming> makes sense why msg == "1" didn't work ;)
[16:20:47] <erming> hehe, by the way, don't use <font>, it's deprecated and should not be used
[16:21:23] <krisek101> yes, i know it:D
[16:21:29] <obert> <font>! in the 2014!
[16:21:41] <krisek101> :<
[16:21:48] <krisek101> I change it;)
[16:21:58] <obert> are you winxp and using front page?
[16:22:03] <erming> lol
[16:22:22] <krisek101> ;)
[16:23:28] * Velveeta tries to cannonball the pool to splash everybody, but does a bellyflop instead! .....and splashes everybody.
[16:23:34] <Velveeta> damn whiskey
[16:24:45] <krisek101> wohoooo
[16:24:50] <krisek101> it work:DD
[16:25:02] <krisek101> s
[16:25:10] <erming> http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/125-great-success.jpg
[16:25:19] <krisek101> :D
[16:25:26] <krisek101> Thank you! :))
[16:25:48] <erming> np!
[16:27:04] <Velveeta> oh borat.. you never get old :D
[16:28:31] <Velveeta> now that i'm home, it's time to beat doge2048
[16:29:58] <erming> .. wtf :D
[16:35:01] <decx> 2048 numberwang is the best
[16:35:06] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[16:41:11] <duch_kazatel> i am dealing with one of the most bizarre errors i've seen in a while.
[16:41:57] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/bajsCRi.png
[16:42:50] <decx> easy just add var document = true beforehand ^^
[16:42:54] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:43:27] <seronis> how can I detect AND prevent when  $('foo').scrollTop('bar') is called?
[16:44:14] <erming> seronis, you could overwrite .scrollTop()
[16:44:29] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[16:44:48] <seronis> $('foo').scrollTop = function() { blah };   ?
[16:44:52] <erming> seronis: here's an example from a plugin i'm currently writing https://github.com/erming/jquery-scroll-glue/blob/master/jquery.scrollGlue.js#L11
[16:44:52] <duch_kazatel> that'll introduce all kinds of carzy problems later one/
[16:44:53] <duch_kazatel> *on
[16:45:25] <erming> duch_kazatel, well, you could overwrite it and still call the "parent" .scrollTop()
[16:45:56] <erming> and just turn if on/off with some kind of boolean
[16:46:17] <duch_kazatel> overwriting methods that aren't yours is generally ill advised.
[16:46:22] <seronis> thats pretty much what im doing.   greasemonkey script to be able to disable an overzealous auto scroll feature
[16:46:32] <seronis> duch,  its greasemonkey.  its the purpose in this case
[16:47:00] <duch_kazatel> meh, i still say it's not a great idea.  but that's me.
[16:47:22] <erming> well, he actually WANTS to break it :>
[16:47:38] <duch_kazatel> not going to change my stance ;)
[16:47:42] <seronis> yup.  thats the goal.   'conditionally' break it because its autoscrolling when it shouldnt
[16:48:14] <seronis> reading your link now erming
[16:49:46] <erming> as you can see i call the old function, but with an extra ".trigger('append')" really
[16:52:01] <erming> if i were you i would just do this: var old = $.fn.scrollTop; $.fn.scrollTop = function() { return old(); }
[16:52:23] <miseria> "no hay formulas para saber el tiempo que requiere un cuerpo en pasar de caliente a frio sin matar el alma" bienvenidos: http://castroruben.com *temo_a_un_ser_sin_rival*
[16:52:24] <erming> just ignoring any parameter, but still returning the scrollTop
[16:52:39] <seronis> thank you erming.  that should work
[16:53:57] <erming> if that doesn't work, remember that basic DOM-elements have a property called scrollTop too.. document.getElementById("header").scrollTop <-- this
[16:54:32] <erming> in case the script you want to turn off use that, instead of the jQuery.scrollTop()
[16:54:40] <erming> good luck :>
[16:56:24] <Velveeta> finally! http://i.imgur.com/cTXJd8o.png
[17:04:12] <tucan> hmm i get autocomplete search list now but it appears unstyled
[17:04:22] <tucan> oh
[17:05:52] <velus> hello all with this script how does this send the data is it get or post http://pastebin.com/xPcBrSgk and also the #grid-status is that a class or an id?
[17:06:14] <duch_kazatel> it defaults to get if I remember correct.
[17:06:19] <duch_kazatel> and # is an ID.
[17:06:21] <velus> ok
[17:06:24] <duch_kazatel> just like in CSS>
[17:06:26] <velus> ok thank you
[17:06:34] <velus> yes i was on about in css
[17:07:35] <velus> would it send it in json format yes?
[17:08:07] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[17:08:14] <duch_kazatel> well, not really.
[17:08:47] <velus> what would it send it like? i will need to know for when i get the info and sort it out
[17:08:49] <duch_kazatel> it gets turned into the query string
[17:08:52] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:09:01] <duch_kazatel> "Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests."
[17:09:29] <velus> ok
[17:09:49] <velus> and to send back data hwo do i do that do i do it in a string format or in json
[17:09:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:10:40] <velus> well it needs data back i.e <b class="offline"> Offline </b>
[17:10:53] <velus> do i send that as a string or as a json
[17:10:59] <duch_kazatel> whichever you want.
[17:11:06] <velus> ok
[17:12:37] <Tomasso> im gettin TypeError: Object #<HTMLTextAreaElement> has no method 'text' ... the question is, is there any way to check if it understands that method prior to call it?
[17:13:30] <duch_kazatel> Tomasso not sure what you mean.  the method probably exists, but the selector might be bad.
[17:14:44] <Tomasso> duch_kazatel: mmm like passing the node as an argument named b and not using $(b)   ?
[17:14:51] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:15:17] <duch_kazatel> wait are you not using the jquery function?
[17:16:21] <BillCriswell> Finally getting around to the new episode of Cosmos. Definitely a step up from that first episode.
[17:16:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah?
[17:16:51] <BillCriswell> Yeah, digging it.
[17:17:13] <BillCriswell> It's no Sagan Cosmos by any means, but still pretty awesome.
[17:17:19] <duch_kazatel> haha
[17:17:28] <BillCriswell> That's some serious shoes to fill.
[17:17:28] <DeltaHeavy> Is Sagan's really better?
[17:17:40] <DeltaHeavy> I kinda thought Tyson would do it better.
[17:17:56] <Tomasso> im passing the node as an argument to the function that executes .text on it.  It was javascript plain.. i had to use $() xD
[17:18:00] <BillCriswell> I hold Sagan in really high regard haha.
[17:18:04] <Tomasso> thanks
[17:18:08] <DeltaHeavy> He's far more charismatic than Sagan at least.
[17:18:27] <DeltaHeavy> I guess a lot of it depends on the people behind it too
[17:18:44] <Velveeta> i never did see sagan's cosmos, but i plan to at some point... i'm loving tyson's so far though
[17:18:45] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: I couldn't disagree more there.
[17:19:02] <DeltaHeavy> Sagan was smart as hell but not very charasmatic. He could explain content in a very easy to understand manner though.
[17:19:17] <duch_kazatel> Tyson is more animated to me.
[17:20:17] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: That's easily my favorite quality of his. He could explain the most complicated things simply. It's such a useful thing.
[17:20:35] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Agree'd. I was hoping for the same from Tyson though.
[17:20:40] <DeltaHeavy> I really gotta get around to watching that.
[17:20:46] <DeltaHeavy> But I'm really into Mad Men for some reason right now.
[17:21:50] <Velveeta> the only shows i'm married to currently are walking dead and revolution
[17:21:55] <Velveeta> and soon to be game of thrones again :D
[17:22:06] <duch_kazatel> i wish my wife liked good shows.
[17:22:09] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's Sagan for me.
[17:22:19] <velus> duch_kazatel: i have set it up on the site with a temp return but it dont seem to be putting in the data i have it send back
[17:22:29] <duch_kazatel> velus huh?
[17:22:42] <duch_kazatel> velus and you're not getting an error?
[17:22:50] <BillCriswell> True Detective just ended... that was incredible.
[17:22:55] <velus> the script, i cant seem to have it in the data and no im not getting an error
[17:23:05] <duch_kazatel> "i can't seem to have it in the data"
[17:23:12] <duch_kazatel> still not understanding.
[17:23:32] <velus> i cant seem to get the information that is sent back put on the page
[17:23:34] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Did you watch True Detective?
[17:23:47] <duch_kazatel> velus share your code again.
[17:24:07] <velus> i.e where you have #gridstatus it dont seem to be putting in the data that is returned
[17:24:17] <Velveeta> billcriswell: i don't know that i've even heard of that one
[17:25:51] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: It's awesome, so dark and addictive.
[17:26:17] <decx> i considered it, is it an arching storyline or separate episodes?
[17:26:37] <velus> sorry duch_kazatel i crashed
[17:26:41] <duch_kazatel> velus it's ok.
[17:26:46] <duch_kazatel> velus you need to share your code.
[17:27:01] <Velveeta> i'm more excited than i probably should be over the fact that they're rebooting heroes :D
[17:27:03] <velus> http://pastebin.com/b7Vqhb8T that has the where the data needs to go to and the serverchek.php
[17:27:03] <BillCriswell> It's an arching story line, they do a different set of detectives every season.
[17:27:15] <velus> http://pastebin.com/xPcBrSgk and that is the js
[17:27:44] <duch_kazatel> do a console.log(data) instead of that grid-status html update.
[17:27:45] <decx> i stay away from arching series that are in production. lost and heroes burned me ^^
[17:27:57] <velus> ok how?
[17:28:04] <duch_kazatel> velus ...
[17:28:11] <duch_kazatel> replace line 7 with what I just put.
[17:28:13] <velus> ok got it
[17:28:34] <BillCriswell> decx: It's different stories every season, so watching the first one and stopping would be ok... but I think it would be impossible to sotp.
[17:28:54] <Velveeta> billcriswell: i'm kind of digging that model... american horror story does the same thing
[17:29:13] <Velveeta> and apparently heroes was originally planned to do that sort of thing, a whole different set of heroes/powers each season, but it didn't turn out that way, maybe the reboot will
[17:29:22] <BillCriswell> I've been thinking about trying that out... is there any super natural shit in that?
[17:29:35] <decx> what they're actually rebooting heroes already?
[17:29:39] <Velveeta> american horror story?
[17:29:43] <Velveeta> decx: yep, 2015 i believe
[17:29:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yes.
[17:29:50] <Velveeta> billcriswell: it's totally worth it
[17:30:07] <Velveeta> and yes, there's definitely some supernatural stuff in it
[17:30:16] <decx> maybe this time peter doesnt have to dump his girlfriends in alternate dimensions -.-
[17:30:27] <Velveeta> that's one option
[17:30:32] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Ehhh, that makes me nervous haha.
[17:30:48] <Velveeta> billcriswell: the first season deals heavily in ghosts, the 2nd is some different stuff
[17:30:59] <BillCriswell> Maybe I'll just skip the first one then.
[17:31:02] <Velveeta> the 3rd, coven, should be obvious :D
[17:31:10] <Velveeta> the first season is one of the best! :)
[17:31:14] <velus> duch_kazatel: i tired that and got nothing again but changed in the servercheck.php header type and got nothign but reverted it back tonormal and got ity working
[17:31:27] <Velveeta> it was actually my favorite partway into the 2nd season, and then the 2nd season wound up kind of tying in my mind
[17:31:40] <BillCriswell> I might have to try it otu.
[17:32:20] <Velveeta> i haven't kept up w/ the 3rd season, but i plan to get back to it at some point
[17:32:41] <duch_kazatel> jesus christ i am going to stab somebody.  this is some really awful code.
[17:33:05] <Velveeta> if you have to stab something, might i suggest your own eyeballs?
[17:33:10] <Velveeta> it'll take away the sting of the code
[17:33:15] <duch_kazatel> that sounds fantastic.
[17:34:25] <Velveeta> so i beat doge2048 earlier, and then clicked to keep playing, because i wanted to see what the 4096 block looked like.... i didn't make it
[17:34:41] <Velveeta> i topped out at 33908 points though
[17:34:46] <duch_kazatel> this.errorMessage = $(this.field.tagName === 'UL' ? '<li/>' : '<em/>', {'class': 'error','text': message});
[17:34:48] <duch_kazatel> i mean, wow.
[17:35:09] <Velveeta> ouch
[17:35:47] <duch_kazatel> and this whole thing is fucked because for some reason when they call the constructor, the current context is the document.
[17:35:49] <duch_kazatel> i hate myself.
[17:44:07] <skypce> hello guys
[17:44:48] <skypce> how can i select all checkboxes with a button that say "all selected" and when press again button deselect all and say "none selected"
[17:44:53] <duch_kazatel> woah - when they call the constructor, they don't actually set it to anything.  it's just new FormValidator()
[17:45:53] <duch_kazatel> skypce $('#theButton').on('click', function(){ $('.theCheckBoxes').prop('checked', true') }); <-- there's the start
[17:46:22] <duch_kazatel> you'll probably want to set a var that's something like "lastAction" and check against that before proceeding.
[17:48:43] <skypce> thank you duch_kazatel
[17:49:50] <velus> now duch_kazatel i need to get it to do the action every 10 seconds
[17:50:06] <duch_kazatel> setTimeout()
[17:50:16] <velus> ok where and how?
[17:50:20] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setTimeout
[17:50:48] <duch_kazatel> protip: window.setTimeout(code, delay);
[17:50:51] <duch_kazatel> that's what you care about
[17:51:04] <velus> ok
[17:51:05] <duch_kazatel> also - make sure you have some kind of handling for when a request hasn't yet completed.
[17:51:14] <duch_kazatel> if you keep going every 10 seconds, you might have problems.
[17:51:47] <velus> the sockets has a timout of 10s
[17:52:05] <duch_kazatel> still an important thing to consider.
[17:52:12] <velus> im thinking have the timout on the js to 11 seconds
[17:52:15] <duch_kazatel> also: do you have any error handling?
[17:52:43] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables - !
[17:53:07] <velus> yes if the socket comes back not able to connect it show a 0 whcih is then showing a <b class="offlin.......
[17:53:36] <duch_kazatel> velus ...
[17:53:39] <velus> i already have tested if the server is down
[17:53:44] <duch_kazatel> velus you're calling .done() or .success()?
[17:54:49] <duch_kazatel> and then .fail() or .error()?
[17:56:19] <velus> no
[17:56:39] <duch_kazatel> if you're not calling .fail() or .error(), then you do not have error handling.
[17:58:18] <velus> ok so how owuld i do that so it would write <b class="offline"> Error </B> then
[17:58:44] <duch_kazatel> share your fiddle?
[17:59:23] <velus> ok one sec
[18:01:40] <velus> http://fiddle.jshell.net/eT3UW/
[18:02:35] <duch_kazatel> so are you returning <b class="offline"> Error </b> from your server?
[18:03:14] <Velveeta> wait a minute, logging in to the grid? <raisin face> are you writing tron?!
[18:03:26] <duch_kazatel> YES
[18:03:30] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta ++
[18:03:57] <Velveeta> i jam the tron legacy soundtrack at least in part, pretty much every day :D
[18:04:10] <velus> if it connects to the script it will return either online or offline or error,
[18:04:32] <duch_workBeer> velus just a string?
[18:04:37] <velus> yes
[18:04:50] <duch_workBeer> return the whole fragment imo.
[18:05:07] <duch_workBeer> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/aVORWjw_460s_v1.jpg
[18:05:22] <Velveeta> even if the server is returning error messaging for you, you should set up a client-side error handler anyway, just in case something goes wrong w/ the connection itself (dns resolution failure, timeout, etc)
[18:05:28] <duch_workBeer> bingo.
[18:05:39] <Velveeta> i need cat wigs.... x3
[18:05:47] <duch_workBeer> either way, what you have there should work velus
[18:07:31] <velus> yeah Velveeta the script is on the exact same server as the one im checking
[18:08:25] <duch_workBeer> velus it doesn't matter.
[18:08:37] <duch_workBeer> velus you should have client side error handling.
[18:08:40] <velus> ok i will work on the .fail soon
[18:11:21] <velus> duch_workBeer: i have this now http://fiddle.jshell.net/eT3UW/1/ and its not auto reloading
[18:11:34] <velus> well its not changing when i start up the server
[18:12:09] <duch_workBeer> http://fiddle.jshell.net/eT3UW/2/
[18:12:11] <duch_workBeer> try this.
[18:12:19] <duch_workBeer> "its not changing when i start up the server
[18:12:20] <duch_workBeer> "
[18:12:22] <duch_workBeer> explain pls
[18:12:59] <duch_workBeer> also: as much as I love my company, i really wish i'd get promoted all ready.
[18:13:05] <duch_workBeer> they're taking time on paperwork.
[18:13:37] <velus> there is a program on the dedicated server which is a robust server which i refer to the server, it a program that runs on a port
[18:14:41] <duch_workBeer> ah, you mean the app server you're checkin.
[18:14:43] <duch_workBeer> *checking.
[18:14:47] <duch_workBeer> what does your console say?
[18:18:53] <velus> its not saying anything, its setting the string but its not keep refreshing the send and data
[18:19:06] <duch_workBeer> huh?  are you watching the network tab at all?
[18:19:15] <velus> yes
[18:19:26] <duch_workBeer> and what happens?
[18:20:00] <velus> shows the script working, it gives the responce connection keepalive
[18:20:58] <duch_workBeer> huh?
[18:21:04] <duch_workBeer> what is the response body?
[18:22:37] <velus> http://pastebin.com/zVFjbTJP
[18:23:07] <velus> the top that is headrers tab and the bottom is the response tab
[18:23:14] <duch_workBeer> okay.  and that div exists on pageload, right?
[18:23:19] <velus> yes
[18:23:28] <duch_workBeer> then it should work.
