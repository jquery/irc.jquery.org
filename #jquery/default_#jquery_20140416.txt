[00:36:00] <fattest> Is it possible to use my pagenation as tab interface? http://jsbin.com/petaj/1/edit
[00:37:24] <Cork> as tab interface?
[00:38:38] <fattest> yes
[00:38:43] <fattest> i put an example
[00:39:00] <fattest> i want the pagenation to work just like tabs
[00:53:54] <fattest> anyone have any idea how to do this?
[01:04:55] <seutje> fattest: functionally, they are identical
[01:05:18] <seutje> only the visual style differs afaict
[01:06:38] <fattest> but if you click it, how can i make it show the tab content?
[01:08:14] <seutje> I'ma go and guess ur using bootstrap
[01:09:01] <fattest> yes
[01:09:08] <fattest> i lov bootstrap
[01:10:47] <fattest> seutje: do you have any idea how to do this?
[01:11:48] <seutje> fattest: set the href to an ID selector that matches the tab you want activated
[01:12:20] <seutje> god their docs are horrible
[01:13:06] <seutje> thanks for reminding me why I don't use it
[01:16:30] <fattest> i see
[01:19:28] <ussher_> fattest: your tabs are not changing the page while your pagination stuff is, so if you can load your pagination via js too then http://jsbin.com/danocaba/1/edit will make the page number show as active
[01:22:27] <seutje> ussher_: kinda breaks when hitting prev/next tho
[01:23:15] <ussher_> yeah not perfect.  can flesh it out if its even viable.  pagination might need  a page refresh for all i know.
[01:25:07] <fattest> i do see
[01:25:13] <fattest> should i stick to using tabs?
[01:28:49] <fattest> however, how can i get the pagenation to show these divs. http://jsbin.com/danocaba/2/edit ?
[01:29:06] <Starcraftmazter> hi guys
[01:29:13] <Starcraftmazter> is it possible to do a responsive query in jquery?
[01:29:17] <Starcraftmazter> using bootstrap/respond.js
[01:29:23] <Starcraftmazter> sorry media query
[01:29:26] <fattest> lol another bootstrapper ^
[01:30:02] <Starcraftmazter> ;(
[01:30:05] <Starcraftmazter> not my fault dudes
[01:30:13] <Starcraftmazter> design/creatives made this thing, which is a little too cool
[01:30:16] <Starcraftmazter> now i have to make it work
[01:30:40] <Starcraftmazter> imagine a grid of elements, and below each element when you click on it, a div has to appear and push the rest of the grid down
[01:30:49] <Starcraftmazter> but each element of the grid is responsible, so it can go from 4 per row to
[01:30:49] <Starcraftmazter> 1
[01:31:03] <Starcraftmazter> so the placing of the div depends on the resolution/size, etc
[01:31:39] <ravenzz> fattest lol
[01:31:52] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: no, you can't do media queries in jquery
[01:32:02] <Starcraftmazter> so how would i do that thing i just described?
[01:33:02] <fattest> how can i  get get this tab feature to work Cork ? http://jsbin.com/danocaba/2/edit
[01:33:18] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: i guess you would have to check resize
[01:33:30] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: and then you can use window.matchMedia
[01:33:33] <ravenzz> I don't know what media queries have to do with what you just described but ... you can use matchMedia
[01:33:51] <ravenzz> but maybe something like masonry can do that for you
[01:34:14] <Starcraftmazter> Cork: i know, but how can i check the responsiveness, ie how many elements are per row
[01:34:14] <Cork> fattest: donno never used it
[01:34:51] <ravenzz> Starcraftmazter that's not a media queries related thing
[01:34:55] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: well you could either check the offsets of each elemnt to get how many there are
[01:35:19] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: or if you control it through media queries you can use the same rules you have in the css
[01:36:31] <ravenzz> if you use masonry you can expand something and then rearrange your stuff
[01:43:06] <fattest> Cork: with Jquery UI tabs, is it possible to use an arrow to scroll through tab list if you have many tabs? http://jsbin.com/judiz/1/edit
[01:43:34] <Cork> fattest: i don't think there is a native support for that
[01:43:45] <Cork> though it should be possible to extend it to support it
[01:46:29] <alexw> parsleyjs or jquery validate?
[01:46:52] <ravenzz> Starcraftmazter something like this I guess http://jsfiddle.net/M28gk/
[01:47:11] <ravenzz> click the boxes
[02:01:46] <AustLaw> how do I create an xml element?
[02:04:34] <AustLaw> or how can I get the document a node exists in?
[02:36:56] <fattest> How do I disable smooth scrolling for which the target have a class called scrollFalse? http://jsfiddle.net/SAuLP/
[02:41:26] <seutje> fattest: seriously? just check the class on this
[02:41:52] <fattest> seutje: but i dont want to add a class to every <a>
[02:42:05] <fattest> its only for the few ones that I DONT want to scroll, which is like 2 or 3
[02:42:38] <seutje> so slap a ! on it
[02:43:26] <seutje> delay = 1000 * !$(this).is('.scrollFalse'); // DONE
[02:44:16] <fattest> seutje:: shouldn't I change 'a[href*=#]:not([href=#]) ?
[02:44:28] <seutje> that selector and awkward replace pattern is gross btw
[02:44:40] <seutje> I don't even know what ur trying to accomplish there
[02:44:47] <seutje> exclude external links?
[02:45:02] <fattest> seutje: I'm following this tutorial http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/
[02:45:39] <fattest> http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/improved-animated-scrolling-script-for-same-page-links/
[02:46:42] <seutje> that doesn't rly seem like a tutorial at all
[02:47:01] <fattest> the second link seems more
[02:50:39] <seutje> heh, I usually do it exactly the other way around
[02:53:47] <fattest> seutje: how can I do it my way?
[02:54:07] <fattest> seutje: i tried $('a[href*=#]:not([href=#]), a[class!="scrollFalse"]').click
[02:54:50] <Cork> fattest: 1. always quote your attribute values
[02:55:15] <Cork> 2. don't use links for things that isn't links (href="#")
[02:55:29] <seutje> fattest: huh? I never meant to give that impression, I would just make the delay dependent on the presence of the class
[02:56:34] <seutje> also, that selector would *also* select all links that doesn't have a class attribute that matches *exactly* that value
[02:56:35] <Cork> $('a[href*="#"]:not([href="#"], .scrollFalse)') should do what you want
[02:57:00] <Cork> though again you shouldn't need the first not selector
[02:59:20] <fattest> Cork: thanks
[02:59:47] <fattest> Cork: by 'first not selector', is it this? ":not([href="#"]"
[03:00:00] <Cork> [href="#"]
[03:00:09] <Cork> if you need that it means you abuse links
[03:00:50] <fattest> Cork: so, "$('a[href*="#"]:not(.scrollFalse)')" ?
[03:01:08] <Cork> fattest: yes
[03:01:15] <fattest> thank you cork
[03:01:42] <Cork> fattest: also a[href*="#"] might be converted to a[href^="#"]
[03:01:54] <Cork> if you structure the links to not include there current url
[03:02:27] <Cork> something you should do anyway as it would break links to external pages with a hash tag
[03:02:44] <Cork> <a href="http://example.com#something">
[03:02:53] <Starcraftmazter> ravenzz: nono
[03:03:02] <Starcraftmazter> ravenzz: grid of even boxes
[03:03:06] <Starcraftmazter> 4 per row
[03:03:16] <Starcraftmazter> if you click on one, a full width div appears (a new div)
[03:04:09] <fattest> ok
[03:05:41] <Starcraftmazter> and then as you pull it in
[03:05:44] <Starcraftmazter> it will be 2 per row
[03:05:47] <Starcraftmazter> then 1 per row
[03:05:48] <Starcraftmazter> (mobile)
[03:05:49] <Starcraftmazter> etc
[03:31:02] <n-a-n> hi
[03:54:05] <Moccodo> I have a problem with jQuery mobile and tabs. All I want is to add my tabs dynamically, but they are displayed like a normal link and not rendered like static tabs. I guess that $('#tabs').tabs('refresh') does not work properly.  I have pasted the code into a fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/FL3hU/) but there it doesn't even add a tab. What's wrong?
[03:55:16] <Moccodo> The fiddle works with jQuery UI, so is this a bug?
[04:08:08] <K-202> Hi. How to get an element which ID contains dots (.)?
[04:08:33] <Uhkis> as normal?
[04:11:07] <K-202> $('#SP.Ribbon.Button') doesn't work
[04:12:24] <K-202> or $('#SP.Ribbon.Button-with-dashes')
[04:14:04] <Uhkis> K-202: $('#SP\\.Ribbon\\.Button')
[04:14:40] <prtksxna> Uhkis++
[04:27:45] <Cork> K-202: as it hasn't been said before; you should try to avoid . [ ] and # in ids and classes
[04:30:00] <K-202> Cork: . and - are forced by SharePoint
[04:30:45] <seutje> what a bunch of dicks
[04:31:40] <Uhkis> what do you expect from microsoft
[04:44:00] <seutje> magic like font-face, XMLHttpRequest, contenteditable, hardware accelerated font rendering, ...
[04:44:57] <prtksxna> Cork: but dots are allowed in id's, right?
[04:46:01] <Uhkis>  ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").
[05:04:48] <Cork> zz_prtksxna: it is allowed, but very unpractical as it means you get problems if you want to use them in your css files, in js and so on
[05:05:20] <Cork> zz_drakythe: as [] is for attributes . is for classes and # is for ids you much better steering clear of those chars
[05:05:30] <Cork> *you are much
[05:05:34] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a horizontal scrollbar using jquery that will work with mouse and autostarts?
[05:05:55] <Cork> autostarts?
[05:06:12] <Cork> are you looking for a scrollbar replacement?
[05:08:54] <antihero> Is there a way in ajaxsetup to override the processData function?
[05:08:58] <antihero> instead of turning it on or off
[05:09:18] <antihero> because it seems utterly stupid that I have to call JSON.Stringify every single time I create a request
[05:10:21] <Cork> antihero: use ajaxPrefilter
[05:10:49] <antihero> Cork: Thanks
[05:11:03] <Cork> ?jQuery.ajaxPrefilter
[05:24:32] <KyleNeedham> I have an issue with jQueryUI sortable http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23107327/jqueryui-sortable-item-incorrect-position-while-dragging
[05:25:02] <bweston> KyleNeedham: I can see that originalPosition  object isn't be set correctly.
[05:25:46] <KyleNeedham> Yeah i seen that no idea why though?
[05:26:26] <bweston> Don't expect much, the channel seems dead.
[05:28:37] <seutje> KyleNeedham: removing the width seems to fix it, so I'm guessing it's a wrapping issue where the position is determined before the positioning kicks in, or something
[05:29:00] <Raydiation> how do i get the mimetype of an url?
[05:29:19] <Raydiation> can i set an url as a src for a file input?
[05:30:08] <Cork> Raydiation: you would have to do a ajax get of the resource to get the content-type
[05:30:25] <Raydiation> Cork: i want to do that without downloading it
[05:30:32] <Raydiation> and i want to do it for any url
[05:30:35] <Cork> Raydiation: you can't
[05:30:45] <Cork> unless you implement a special protocol on the server
[05:30:51] <Raydiation> yeah cors
[05:30:57] <seutje> KyleNeedham: oh, I know: the border on the placeholder is prolly fucking things up
[05:30:57] <Raydiation> thats my problem
[05:30:58] <Cork> like a get-mimetype.php
[05:31:09] <Raydiation> why the hell did they make HEAD restricted for cors
[05:31:31] <Cork> Raydiation: it isn't if you make an ajax cors
[05:31:40] <Cork> Raydiation: jsonp is another matter though
[05:31:44] <Raydiation> so basically im looking for a workaround for a non cors HEAD
[05:31:56] <Raydiation> jsonp requires the server to support it
[05:32:05] <Cork> Raydiation: yes and no
[05:32:14] <Raydiation> its a script tag :)
[05:32:20] <Raydiation> how would you fit an image into that
[05:32:21] <Cork> Raydiation: what jsonp does is create a <script> tag and requests it there ya
[05:32:55] <Cork> unless you implement a separate script to serve the content
[05:33:03] <Cork> you don't have a choice to start downloading the file
[05:33:11] <Cork> *resource
[05:34:45] <Raydiation> or maybe turn off cors?
[05:35:16] <Raydiation> i see its a browser param :/
[05:37:35] <Cork> Raydiation: that is normally a very bad idea
[05:38:00] <Raydiation> so what should i do, open a bug at w3c?
[05:38:31] <Cork> Raydiation: first of; what is it your trying to do?
[05:38:43] <Raydiation> replacing image urls with <img tags
[05:38:50] <Raydiation> currently i only parse the url extension
[05:39:07] <Cork> ok, and why do you need the mimetype?
[05:39:20] <Raydiation> because you can also serve media without an extension
[05:39:29] <Raydiation> url rewriting, routes etc
[05:39:43] <Cork> Raydiation: why not do something like <img src="url"><span>url</span>
[05:39:49] <Cork> and on error you remove the img tag
[05:39:58] <Cork> and on load you remove the span
[05:40:36] <Raydiation> how do i detect an error?
[05:40:48] <Raydiation> and does this also work for <video and <audio?
[05:41:36] <Raydiation> Cork: oh :)
[05:41:37] <Raydiation> thanks
[05:41:39] <Cork> var img = $('<img>'); img.on('error', removeImg).on('load', removeSpan).attr('src', url); target.append(img);
[05:42:44] <Raydiation> it also errors when it cant play it as audio right?
[05:42:53] <Raydiation> so i can get rid of canPlayType
[05:43:07] <Cork> audio and video is quite different from img
[05:43:24] <Cork> as they have the source thing with fallbacks
[05:43:33] <Cork> not sure if you get an error if none of them can play
[05:43:35] <Cork> i don't remember
[05:43:47] <Raydiation> 4 = MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED - audio/video not supported
[05:43:58] <Raydiation> you have to listen for the error code
[05:45:41] <Raydiation> i hope the implementation is efficient
[05:45:52] <Raydiation> basically errors on wrong mimetype first before downloading a ton
[05:46:06] <Cork> it will cause quite a bit of download
[05:46:15] <Cork> but not very much you can do about that client side
[05:46:21] <krambiorix> how can i check if a string contains 11 digits?
[05:46:43] <Cork> krambiorix: /\d{9}/
[05:47:55] <Cork> js> print(/\d{9}/.test("a111111111a"))
[05:47:56] <Raydiation> /\d{11}/ right  :)
[05:47:59] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:48:02] <Cork> lol
[05:48:05] <krambiorix> :p
[05:48:09] <Cork> ya donno where i got 9 from...
[05:48:19] <krambiorix> that was my next question
[05:48:39] <Cork> js> print(/\d{11}/.test("a11411517139a"))
[05:48:44] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:48:55] <Cork> js> print(/^\d{11}$/.test("11411517139"))
[05:49:00] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:49:02] <Cork> if you just want numbers
[05:50:10] <krambiorix> Cork, also dots and -
[05:50:29] <Cork> js> print(/^[0-9.-]{11}$/.test("11411517139"))
[05:50:34] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:50:47] <Raydiation> i think he wants to match something like a credit card
[05:50:48] <Cork> though i think \d does that
[05:50:57] <Cork> js> print(/^\d{11}$/.test("11-11517.39"))
[05:51:00] <Raydiation> so . and - in addition
[05:51:02] <b-ot> Cork: false
[05:51:13] <Cork> nope ^^
[05:51:15] <slax0r> Cork: isn't \d for digit?
[05:51:20] <Raydiation> yes
[05:51:21] <Cork> it is
[05:51:24] <slax0r> . - don't appear digits to me :)
[05:51:29] <Cork> js> print(/^[0-9.-]{11}$/.test("11-11517.39")
[05:51:34] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:51:40] <Cork> slax0r: but it is numeric
[05:51:49] <Cork> so you can stretch it to include those :)
[05:51:58] <krambiorix> the string should contain 11 digits but can also have . and -
[05:52:02] <Cork> js> print(/^[0-9.-]{11}$/.test("11-11517.39"))
[05:52:06] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:52:25] <krambiorix> so the total string length doesn't matter
[05:52:29] <Cork> ah
[05:52:36] <Cork> that is trickier
[05:53:01] <Cork> js> print(/^\d{11}$/.test("11-11517.39".replace(".-", "")))
[05:53:02] <Cork> :D
[05:53:05] <b-ot> Cork: false
[05:53:11] <Cork> js> print(/^\d{11}$/.test("11-1135517.39".replace(".-", "")))
[05:53:15] <krambiorix> lol
[05:53:16] <b-ot> Cork: false
[05:53:19] <Cork> O_o
[05:53:22] <Cork> ah
[05:53:30] <Cork> js> print(/^\d{11}$/.test("11-1135517.39".replace(/[.-]/, "")))
[05:53:34] <b-ot> Cork: false
[05:53:42] <Cork> js> print(/^\d{11}$/.test("11-1135517.39".replace(/[.-]/g, "")))
[05:53:47] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:53:47] <slax0r> :D
[05:53:50] <Cork> yay
[05:54:21] <Cork> another option would be
[05:54:52] <Cork> js> print("11-1135517.39".match(/\d/).length == 12)
[05:54:56] <b-ot> Cork: false
[05:55:11] <Cork> bleh
[05:55:19] <Cork> js> print("11-1135517.39".match(/\d/g).length == 12)
[05:55:30] <b-ot> Cork: false
[05:55:53] <Cork> ah right js doesn't give the full string
[05:55:58] <Cork> js> print("11-1135517.39".match(/\d/g).length == 11)
[05:56:03] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:56:18] * Cork stops playing with the bot
[05:56:39] <krambiorix> js> print("12.12-45-88789".match(/\d/g).length == 11)
[05:56:43] <b-ot> krambiorix: true
[05:56:50] <krambiorix> alright
[05:57:06] <Cork> though it has it's week point
[05:57:22] <Cork> js> print("12.12-4aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa5-88aaaaaaaaaa789".match(/\d/g).length == 11)
[05:57:27] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:57:46] <krambiorix> hmmm
[05:59:15] <krambiorix> Cork, is it possible to remove all alfabetical chars?
[05:59:50] <Cork> js> var str = "12.12-4aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa5-88aaaaaaaaaa789", digits = str.match(/\d/g).length, print(/^[\d.-]$/.test(str) && digits == 11)
[05:59:55] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:00:10] <Cork> js> var str = "12.12-4aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa5-88aaaaaaaaaa789", digits = str.match(/\d/g).length; print(/^[\d.-]$/.test(str) && digits == 11)
[06:00:16] <b-ot> Cork: false
[06:00:27] <Cork> krambiorix: that is prob the best you can do
[06:00:47] <Cork> krambiorix: but sure if you want to remove every thing except what you allow you can do that
[06:01:19] <Cork> js> var str = "12.12-4aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa5-88aaaaaaaaaa789" print(str.replace(/[^\d.-]/g, ""))
[06:01:25] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:01:29] <Cork> sigh
[06:01:34] <Cork> js> var str = "12.12-4aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa5-88aaaaaaaaaa789"; print(str.replace(/[^\d.-]/g, ""))
[06:01:39] <b-ot> Cork: 12.12-45-88789
[06:05:13] <krambiorix> Cork, but alfabetical characters are not acceptable
[06:05:26] <Cork> krambiorix: you said remove :)
[06:05:53] <shafox> How to do a post with Content-Type: application/json, application/vnd.api.v1+json ?
[06:06:01] <krambiorix> Cork, i'm very sorry :s
[06:06:15] <Cork> krambiorix: the test before that did that
[06:06:21] <Cork> js> var str = "12.12-4aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa5-88aaaaaaaaaa789", digits = str.match(/\d/g).length; print(/^[\d.-]$/.test(str) && digits == 11)
[06:06:26] <b-ot> Cork: false
[06:06:59] <krambiorix> aah yes
[06:07:11] <Cork> shafox: $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', dataType: 'json', data: JSON.stringify(object) })
[06:08:03] <Cork> krambiorix: but is the . and - meant to be at specific positions?
[06:08:28] <Cork> cause then it might be better to write a more complex regex that checks that they are at the correct place
[06:08:36] <shafox> Cork: that is for the server will send to client in json format , what I want is to sent the request header parameter to server that content-type is application/json
[06:08:40] <krambiorix> Cork, no the . and - can be everywhere
[06:08:53] <Forbidd3n> Cork: I am trying to get this to autoscroll to the right when hovering over a 'right' button and same if I hover over a 'left' button - http://baijs.com/tinyscrollbar/
[06:09:08] <krambiorix> js> var str = "86.03.04-211.41", digits = str.match(/\d/g).length; print(/^[\d.-]$/.test(str) && digits == 11)
[06:09:16] <b-ot> krambiorix: false
[06:09:24] <krambiorix> Cork, this should be true
[06:09:39] <Cork> shafox: ah, sorry you set contentType:
[06:09:41] <Cork> sorry for the mixup
[06:10:17] <shafox> Cork: no problem , I guess to setup that i just have to add another option , contenttType: "application/json" right ?
[06:11:08] <Cork> krambiorix: dough...
[06:11:19] <Cork> krambiorix: i missed the + in the test check >_<
[06:11:29] <Cork> js> var str = "86.03.04-211.41", digits = str.match(/\d/g).length; print(/^[\d.-]+$/.test(str) && digits == 11)
[06:11:34] <b-ot> Cork: true
[06:11:52] <Cork> shafox: yes
[06:12:06] <shafox> Cork: thanks
[06:15:41] <krambiorix> Cork, a big thanks for solving this!!
[06:15:48] <Cork> np
[06:17:59] <Forbidd3n> Cork: can you help me with my question if you have the time?
[06:18:53] <Cork> Forbidd3n: i seriously recommend not replacing the native scrollbars
[06:19:06] <Forbidd3n> Cork: it is for a div not the browser
[06:19:12] <Forbidd3n> it is a scrolling timeline div
[06:19:23] <Forbidd3n> the timeline is a single image
[06:19:23] <Cork> Forbidd3n: just use the normal scrollbars
[06:19:29] <Cork> you can still scroll it automatically
[06:19:35] <t4nk807> hey guys
[06:19:54] <Forbidd3n> Cork: ok, but how would I get the area to scroll automatically to the right on hover of right button and left on hover of left button
[06:19:58] <Forbidd3n> and auto scroll on load
[06:20:05] <Cork> Forbidd3n: one min
[06:20:14] <t4nk807> im trying to fix this in jquery where when i click the show more link, it switches to "show less" and back to show more when i click again. any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/FLS5L/1/
[06:20:29] <Forbidd3n> t4nk807: checking...
[06:23:09] <Forbidd3n> t4nk807: this should work - http://jsfiddle.net/FLS5L/2/
[06:23:27] <monk12> Hey all, i had a question about abs and relative filepaths in drupal...
[06:23:42] <t4nk807> thanks
[06:23:48] <Forbidd3n> monk12: wrong channel I believe
[06:23:53] <monk12> whoops!
[06:23:59] <monk12> haha ;)
[06:24:11] <Cork> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/6EpAk/
[06:25:01] <Forbidd3n> Cork: nice - but using a left/right button on hover
[06:25:13] <Forbidd3n> scroll right until end and stop and same for left
[06:25:27] <Cork> Forbidd3n: just remove the callback use in the functions :)
[06:27:09] <Cork> a little nicer example :D http://jsfiddle.net/6EpAk/1/
[06:27:56] <Forbidd3n> Cork: so you don't recommend styling the scrollbar?
[06:28:19] <Cork> Forbidd3n: you can't style the scrollbars
[06:28:19] <Forbidd3n> I need it to stay visible and a specific track color
[06:28:38] <Forbidd3n> that is why I need a solution with custom scrollbar
[06:28:41] <Cork> Forbidd3n: to do that you have to remove then and recreate something similar through js
[06:29:02] <Cork> Forbidd3n: ya, and that is really really hard to do correctly
[06:29:29] <Cork> basically the only site i've seen that does that successfully is gmail
[06:29:40] <Cork> (and google docs)
[06:30:10] <Cork> Forbidd3n: for example if you try scrolling with the mouse wheel in your plugin example
[06:30:26] <Cork> you get an extremely slow scroll
[06:30:31] <Forbidd3n> no need for mouse wheel I have it turned off
[06:30:44] <Cork> and most likely it will break on touch devices
[06:30:57] <Cork> if nothing else it will look out of place
[06:32:15] <decx> i heard good things about this: http://jnicol.github.io/trackpad-scroll-emulator/ but never used it
[06:34:02] <Forbidd3n> decx: looks nice, but doesn't seem to have autoscroll on start
[06:34:06] <Forbidd3n> or on load I mean
[06:34:21] <Cork> Forbidd3n: you don't need that
[06:34:30] <Cork> as you saw from the code i gave you that is easy to do
[06:35:03] <Forbidd3n> Cork: the design from the client requires the trackbar and background to be styled
[06:35:22] <Cork> Forbidd3n: then you should explain the cost for doing that
[06:35:32] <decx> the scrollbar shouldnt break normal scroll behaviour which you rely on for that example from cork
[06:35:52] <decx> and it's used on twitch so it's probably well matured
[06:35:54] <Cork> decx: ya, that plugin looks semi nice
[06:36:25] <Cork> though i still have a problem with most likely breaking easily
[06:37:16] <decx> that's always the problem when you remake existing behaviour from scratch without any benefit, just to please a designer ^^
[06:37:27] <Cork> i've learned through experience that replacing scrollbars is basically as bad as replacing form elements
[06:37:35] <Cork> ya
[06:38:05] <Cork> though i do agree that they should update the specs to allow freer designs of these elements
[06:38:30] <Cork> doesn't make much sense doing these limitations when so many write buggy code to work around it anyway
[06:38:55] <decx> the approaches are so differnt on all the platforms, that would take a commitee decades to work out ;)
[06:39:22] <Cork> decx: well not only that but you can't even get the info to know what design to use
[06:39:24] <seutje> krambiorix: heh... Rijks Register Nummer?
[06:39:46] <krambiorix> seutje Nationaal nummer
[06:39:55] <Cork> decx: but i'll give you this, that plugin is one of the best i've seen
[06:40:19] <Cork> i still wouldn't use it though ^^'
[06:40:51] <decx> me neither, only to shut up annoying customers
[06:41:00] <decx> I WANT A RED SCROLLBAR
[06:41:37] <Forbidd3n> decx: ok so I can use that plugin I can still use Cork's example since the plugin uses the traditional scrollbar
[06:41:57] <decx> most likely
[06:42:04] <Forbidd3n> will give it a shot thanks
[06:42:16] <Cork> Forbidd3n: no the plugin doesn't use the traditional scrollbar
[06:42:22] <Cork> Forbidd3n: that is impossible
[06:42:36] <Cork> Forbidd3n: it does most likely listen for scroll though
[06:42:43] <Cork> so the code i gave you should work
[06:42:46] <Forbidd3n> For the most part Trackpad Scroll Emulator uses the browser's native scrolling functionality, but replaces the conventional scrollbar with a custom CSS-styled scrollbar
[06:43:07] <Cork> ya, functionality == overflow: hidden
[06:43:19] <Cork> most scrollbar replacement plugins does this
[06:43:32] <Cork> except for a few exceptionally buggy ones that position absolute everything...
[06:43:48] <decx> if you want to control the viewport into a wide contentelement you'd probably be better served with a translateX approach
[06:44:27] <Cork> pitty @key-frame can't animate scroll :D
[06:44:32] <decx> yet
[06:44:45] <Cork> ya, i've seen talk about it on the mailing list
[06:45:04] <TViernion> can i use load() to load a specific div from the current page and then update said div?
[06:45:18] <Cork> TViernion: not really no
[06:45:27] <Cork> you load the entire page and then filter out the div you want
[06:45:39] <Cork> it will then be put into the element you pointed it to
[06:46:24] <decx> wat? load a div from the current page?`
[06:46:31] <decx> so just move the div? wat?
[06:46:33] <Cork> <div id="container"></div> | <div id="container"><div id="content"></div> $('#container').load('url #content')
[06:47:01] <Cork> decx: i suspect he meant fetch a new set from the server
[06:47:18] <Cork> TViernion: it is really recommended to have the server send a partial instead though
[06:47:30] <TViernion> So if i'm on this_page.php and i have #update div   $(#update).load('this_page.php #update');
[06:47:31] <Cork> TViernion: as this will send the entire page cross the net
[06:47:34] <decx> if i went by suspecting what people want this channel would be unbearable :D
[06:47:59] <Cork> TViernion: you will get <div id="update"><div id="update"></div></div> after the fetch
[06:48:15] <TViernion> right... but it will re-run all the php.. correct?
[06:48:38] <Cork> TViernion: that effect comes from how jquery .load works
[06:49:11] <Cork> when the full page comes back it does target.html($(data).find('#update'))
[06:49:18] <Cork> meaning you will add the matched element
[06:49:19] <decx> it might be worth writing an endpoint in your php to request only a specific snippet from your server
[06:49:24] <Cork> not the content of the matched element
[06:49:29] <Cork> ya
[06:49:38] <Cork> that is definitely the correct solution
[06:49:47] <Cork> the .load thing is a hack you really should avoid
[06:50:02] <TViernion> Let me explain what im trying to do.. maybe your route is the best.
[06:50:03] <Cork> (and i really don't like that it is part of the core framework)
[06:50:03] <decx> so you can request this_page.php?update or something
[06:50:38] <TViernion> I have a log of php code that pulls info and calculates variables.  I need that to run again and reload a specifc div only.. so i don't lose eevery thing there is
[06:50:44] <decx> load is fine for what it is, an entry point for nonprogrammers to reload stuff with an easy to grasp syntax
[06:51:07] <Cork> TViernion: so move the content of that div out into it's own php file
[06:51:16] <Cork> TViernion: and have the core page require that php file
[06:51:25] <Cork> TViernion: and then when you want to update just that div
[06:51:36] <TViernion> i cannot do that...
[06:51:38] <Cork> you do $('div').load('div_partial.php')
[06:51:55] <Cork> TViernion: why not?
[06:52:21] <rethus> can i set all accordions to be closed at startup?
[06:52:23] <TViernion> the calculations are done for the entire page, not just the single div.  some of them are used before this div, some after.
[06:52:31] <decx> can't as in, not able, not willing or not not ^^
[06:52:43] <BeWilled> How can I tell which file is responsible with an onChange event of a combo box?
[06:52:49] <decx> there's an option for that rethus
[06:53:06] <Cork> TViernion: then factor the calculation out of it and call it in both places
[06:53:29] <Cork> TViernion: but have the second one check if a variable is set and don't require it again if it is already done
[06:53:44] <TViernion> mmm.. duplication of code.. i see...
[06:53:44] <Cork> TViernion: what i'm trying to say is you should solve this server side
[06:53:52] <Cork> TViernion: cause that is where you can do it at low cose
[06:53:55] <Cork> *cost
[06:54:02] <decx> rethus set to collapsible:true active: false
[06:54:06] <Cork> TViernion: no no need for duplicate code
[06:54:11] <Cork> TViernion: you just need to factor out the code both depend on
[06:54:27] <Forbidd3n> Cork: doesn't work with your functions - should it?
[06:54:30] <rethus> decx: k. thanks. I've tryed disabled:true
[06:54:42] <Cork> Forbidd3n: the scrollbars doesn't move?
[06:54:56] <Forbidd3n> not with to and from functions
[06:55:02] <Cork> lovely
[06:55:06] <BeWilled> When I see chrome debuger its says that the "initiator" file is jquery.form.min.js?v=2.69:11... but where is the coded script?
[06:55:10] <Cork> so it doesn't listen for the scroll event
[06:55:22] <rethus> decx: works like a charm :) thank you
[06:55:23] <Cork> Forbidd3n: then you can only do the scroll animation if the plugin allows you
[06:55:47] <Cork> Forbidd3n: meaning if they expose a function to set the scroll position
[06:59:09] <Forbidd3n> Cork: anyway to take what you have and apply it to the div area as well as a drag bar inside of a track
[06:59:23] <Forbidd3n> so scrollLeft of the div content and the track bar at the same time
[06:59:31] <Cork> Forbidd3n: not unless the plugin exposes something to use
[06:59:57] <Cork> Forbidd3n: basically the plugin doesn't support not being the one scrolling the element
[07:00:24] <Forbidd3n> Cork: I mean if I create a track and dragbar
[07:00:26] <Cork> that most likely means it breaks from hash scrolls too
[07:00:58] <Cork> Forbidd3n: if you create it all your self your back and having to emulate the scrollbar functionality again
[07:04:24] <Forbidd3n> anyway to make traditional scrollbar to stay visible
[07:05:23] <Cork> Forbidd3n: override overflow: hidden with overflow: scroll or auto
[07:21:19] <krambiorix> When i refresh my page (F5) in firefox, i see that my form is still filled in... How can i remove all that data? In the source I see value="" -> ?
[07:21:58] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You can use .reset() on the form element.
[07:22:12] <BillCriswell> $('form')[0].reset();
[07:22:18] <computer2000> is it possible to load a vimeo video into a custom made html5 video player?
[07:22:21] <BillCriswell> If you already have a jquery element.
[07:22:59] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, but when the value="foo" -> foo shouldn't be removed
[07:23:41] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: That'll reset the form to what it was like when it's loaded, so whatever is in the value attribute will be in the input.
[07:24:05] <BillCriswell> .reset() doesn't clear a form, it resets it.
[07:24:23] <Nindustries> Hi, fiddling around with Jquery mobile. Im trying to recreate a login screen, is there a style already included in jQ.m that can center this and make it 100% width when screen is small? http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-04162014-042254pm.php
[07:25:07] <Forbidd3n> Cork: I have - overflow: scroll; - and it doesn't stay visible
[07:25:25] <Cork> try !important
[07:25:32] <Cork> it plugin most likely set it inline
[07:27:20] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/5yUzy/1/  ->  this.reset is not a function
[07:27:49] <Cork> krambiorix: reset is on the form not the field
[07:28:25] <krambiorix> Cork, i have no form , only the fields :s
[07:28:42] <Cork> krambiorix: you should ALWAYS have a form
[07:29:03] <BillCriswell> Ay yi yi
[07:29:19] <krambiorix> Cork, why is that?
[07:30:34] <krambiorix> Cork,  is this something like: you can' t have sex with the teacher?
[07:31:00] <BillCriswell> It's like a database with all the data outside of the database.
[07:31:08] <krambiorix> :p
[07:32:10] <Cork> krambiorix: much of the default actions of the browser depends on the form elements
[07:32:32] <Cork> krambiorix: like form fill, enter for submit, accessibility helps and so on
[07:32:47] <Cork> krambiorix: so for that reason you should always have it
[07:33:13] <BillCriswell> There's really so many reasons.
[07:33:38] <krambiorix> ok
[07:34:09] <krambiorix> So i have a div now with all my form elements in it. How can i add a form around those elements with jquery?
[07:34:33] <Cork> krambiorix: simplest is prob to just replace the div with form
[07:34:41] <Cork> and leave the rest
[07:34:58] <Forbidd3n> Cork:  with your example on hover out anyway to stop animation?
[07:34:59] <krambiorix> Cork,  hmm, my div is being used for a dialog()
[07:35:08] <BillCriswell> Why do you want to do it with jquery?
[07:35:37] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, too much hassle with php
[07:36:01] <krambiorix> ow wait
[07:36:48] <Cork> Forbidd3n: just add a blur handler and .stop() on the element
[07:37:14] <Forbidd3n> got it working thanks
[07:38:24] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, but still 	$('form').reset();  -> $(...).reset is not a function
[07:38:59] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: That's not what I showed you.
[07:39:32] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yeah but i want to reset all forms
[07:39:39] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, create a for loop?
[07:39:44] <BillCriswell> No.
[07:39:52] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: $('form')[0].reset()
[07:40:15] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, then the first form will be resetted
[07:42:09] <BillCriswell> You're right. Loop.
[07:42:45] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/vudal/1/edit
[07:43:07] <BillCriswell> So use to jQuery handling a collection of elements I didn't think about that.
[07:43:27] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yeah, okay thanks a lot!
[07:44:15] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:47:07] <msafi> Why is "hasBeenClicked" variable logged out as "true" in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vTz9y/?
[07:47:42] <msafi> I have e.preventDefault() executed on an event handler that's supposed to be registered before the event handler that sets hasBeenClicked to true...
[07:48:24] <NoiseEee> msafi: it is
[07:48:39] <NoiseEee> i see true in my log?
[07:49:06] <msafi> NoiseEee: yes, it should be false though, because see the eventlistener that's registered in line 5.
[07:49:13] <BillCriswell> msafi: event.preventDefault() doesn't stop the click event from happening, just the browser from following the link.
[07:49:55] <msafi> BillCriswell: do you know how I could test if preventDefault was actually executed using code?
[07:50:08] * msafi is trying to write a unit test
[07:53:01] <dwarder> msafi: what do you use?
[07:53:06] <dwarder> for unit testing
[07:53:12] <msafi> Jasmine
[07:53:13] <computer2000> is there a jquery function to kill heartache in a persistent way?
[07:53:19] <BillCriswell> msafi: stopImmediatePropagation() maybe?
[07:53:37] <msafi> BillCriswell: what does that do?
[07:53:40] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/vTz9y/1/
[07:53:48] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopimmediatepropagation/
[07:53:51] <computer2000> like forgetAboutGirl(name); or such
[07:54:27] <msafi> BillCriswell: cool thanks!
[07:54:43] <BillCriswell> msafi: No problem.
[07:55:01] <BillCriswell> computer2000: I thought you were talking about heartbleed for a second and was lost.
[07:55:22] <Nindustries> So my current webapp is rather static written. Is there any way to make them size dynamically? http://d00med.net/cordova/
[07:58:21] <BillCriswell> "them"?
[07:58:50] <computer2000> slangish - yo dude make them size alright will ya?
[07:59:23] <BillCriswell> I want a bagel.
[07:59:55] <lolmaus> I've got a nested HTML heirarchy: .foo._root > .bar > .baz > .foo > .bar > .baz... I've got a jQuery object: `var $foo = $('.foo._root');`.  I've got a selector string: `var selector = ".bar > .baz". I would like to select $foo's immediate .baz with this selector. How can i do that?
[08:01:21] <BillCriswell> lolmaus: $foo.children('.baz') I think?
[08:01:47] <iamntz> lolmaus, tro this: $(selector, '.foo._root').children()
[08:01:54] <lolmaus> BillCriswell: .baz is not an immediate child of .foo.
[08:02:43] <BillCriswell> $foo.children(selector) ?
[08:02:49] <Nindustries> BillCriswell, Sorry, I mean the elements on my page
[08:03:03] <Nindustries> A best practice
[08:03:22] <BillCriswell> Example selectors suck.
[08:04:50] <lolmaus> iamntz: $(selector, '.foo._root') will spawn a jQuery collection that contains all instances of .baz. Then their children will be selected.
[08:06:26] <BillCriswell> Are you trying to give pain in the ass examples?

[08:23:04] <Bloomberg> now I need t¬ødo it with Jquery for in the 45 mins of inactivity the screen close automatically
[08:23:13] <Bloomberg> how is the best way of get it?
[08:23:30] <Bloomberg> according to performance and load size
[08:24:38] <bberry> hey all. I am trying to set the css of an element with an object like this... .css({ height: '300px', width: '100px' }); is that how you do it?
[08:24:45] <NoiseEee> you don't get to close a browser tab/screen unless you've opened it, Bloomberg
[08:25:19] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: if you have, just have a setTimeout for 45 minutes that keeps getting reset on every interaction that matters?
[08:25:50] <Bloomberg> NoiseEee : that is well for performacne?
[08:25:54] <Bloomberg> performance*

[08:59:47] <fuchstronaut> I am looking for a responsive menu (horizontal) that will group all links, that would exceed the viewports width, in a single dropdown menu
[08:59:49] <Forbidd3n> meaning that if they already started scrolling then I don't want to auto start the scrolling
[09:00:14] <fuchstronaut> i found a variety of responsive menus, but none that would do that and i dont know what to search for
[09:00:32] <Cork> Forbidd3n: the click and wheel event is prob what you want
[09:00:37] <fuchstronaut> isnt there an event for scrolling?
[09:01:06] <Technodrome> Hey guys!
[09:01:08] <Cork> fuchstronaut: sure, but he is animation scrollLeft :)
[09:01:19] <Cork> *animating
[09:01:33] <fuchstronaut> i see
[09:01:45] <Technodrome> is there any good material or books based on theory / logistics of things when it comes to say js / jquery?
[09:02:06] <fuchstronaut> Cork, do you have any idea for a search term for that kind of responsive menu i described above?
[09:02:09] <Cork> Technodrome: logistic??
[09:02:09] <Forbidd3n> Cork: I have everything working that you gave me, thanks btw. Would you mind adding to your example?
[09:02:10] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome depends on your goals.  i'm a fan of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide
[09:02:29] <Technodrome> just want a solid overview
[09:02:36] <Cork> Forbidd3n: i'm short on time right now
[09:02:45] <Forbidd3n> Cork: np, thanks
[09:02:45] <Technodrome> i dont‚Äô run into any problems, just want to review and make sure
[09:03:00] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome do you mean things like design patterns, conventions, etc?
[09:03:07] <Technodrome> yes sure
[09:03:18] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: a stupid example, but that slider crap, i didn‚Äôt know how they work, now i do
[09:03:21] <fuchstronaut> Technodrome: I recommend "JavaScript: The Good Parts"
[09:03:47] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome i don't know that you're going to find anything that'll cover stuff at that level.
[09:04:16] <Technodrome> hmmm
[09:04:28] <Technodrome> see sometimes with stuff like that, it‚Äôs not the language features
[09:04:35] <Technodrome> its just figuring out a way to implement it
[09:04:38] <duch_kazatel> right
[09:04:59] <duch_kazatel> for a while i made myself learn 1 new thing every day about javascript/jquery.  maybe that'll help?
[09:05:04] <Technodrome> and i thought maybe there is some other things i‚Äôm not sure how to implement, that maybe osme book could help me on
[09:05:16] <Technodrome> good idea actually
[09:05:28] <duch_kazatel> i can't personally think of a book of "here's how to implement sliders, buttons, and links in JS".
[09:05:50] <Technodrome> well its a bit application specific i understand that
[09:06:00] <duch_kazatel> it's more of the level of abstraction/.
[09:06:14] <duch_kazatel> things like that combine a variety of basics.  you care about know the baiscs so you know what tools are available.
[09:06:50] <Technodrome> i was lookng at some implementations of those ‚Äútabs‚Äù things
[09:06:53] <Technodrome> that some sites like to use
[09:07:01] <Technodrome> they work pretty much the same way as the slider really
[09:07:03] <duch_kazatel> for jQuery, I'd start with the jQuery function itself: https://api.jquery.com/jquery/ - it sounds silly, but there are some interesting features that some people don't know about.
[09:07:35] <Technodrome> i went on sf and got some slider code come from like 2000
[09:07:40] <Technodrome> its interesting
[09:08:03] <Technodrome> people were doing like ‚Äúinjecting‚Äù back then, then came, we will hide everything and do a transition (manual)
[09:08:13] <Technodrome> then came jquery and prototype to handle the transition part
[09:08:22] <Technodrome> now the good sliders are using js and using css3 for the transition
[09:08:51] <duch_kazatel> right - that gets into understanding the big three of frontent development
[09:09:16] <duch_kazatel> *frontend
[09:09:48] <Technodrome> https://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced  this could be used maybe to not have to worry about the css3 stuff and still have it hardware accelerated
[09:10:28] <duch_kazatel> imo you should learn and understand the CSS part of things before diving into abstractions like that.
[09:11:01] <Technodrome> i mean i‚Äôm not that much of an idiot :) the css3 transform stuff is very simple
[09:11:37] <duch_kazatel> didn't mean to imply that.
[09:11:40] <Technodrome> it just made was like , hmm, maybe that‚Äôs how it should have been done from the start
[09:14:17] <Technodrome> maybe that should be built into jquery at this point
[09:14:33] <duch_kazatel> i'd probably disagree.
[09:15:18] <Technodrome> i mean having animations accelerated if possible doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad idea
[09:16:15] <duch_kazatel> eh, i'd maybe make that a flag in jquery UI or keep it as a plugin.  jquery does a pretty good job of not playing around too much with my CSS unless it's really obvious that's what it's doing.
[09:19:28] <Doddlin> hey all! would someone have minute to check my paste? I really can‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs breaking‚Ä¶ :(
[09:19:29] <Doddlin> http://pastebin.com/70dtczXr
[09:19:50] <duch_kazatel> Doddlin what specifically is breaking?
[09:20:15] <Doddlin> I guees it‚Äôs a syntax error but I really can‚Äôt find it
[09:20:40] <Doddlin> it is broken in the matter that when I load the page no jQuery is working at all‚Ä¶
[09:20:44] <duch_kazatel> what is the console error you're getting?
[09:21:41] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: good point
[09:21:45] <Technodrome> http://www.cappel-nord.de/ld28/  << is addciting
[09:22:19] <duch_kazatel> Doddlin without seeing a functioning example, it's hard to help.  the JS looks valid - is loadGravatars defined and not broken?
[09:22:34] <Doddlin> I could try commenting that one
[09:22:50] <Doddlin> duch_kazatel, no console msgs
[09:22:56] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[09:22:57] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: some of the other frameworks seem to have it built in though
[09:23:04] <Technodrome> but a flag in jquery ui is probably best
[09:23:26] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome most other libraries aren't as popular as jquery ;)
[09:23:44] <Technodrome> true
[09:24:03] <Technodrome> last stupid question, how does jquery ui draw thigns like a button or checkbox, does it just inject the html? or  ?
[09:24:24] <duch_kazatel> jqueryui does a lot of html+css stuff for you.
[09:24:31] <duch_kazatel> it's slowly moving in the direction of "widgets" iirc.
[09:24:43] <Technodrome> so a button , is it using some ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù all in js solution
[09:24:46] <Technodrome> or is it generating html?
[09:24:57] <duch_kazatel> have an example?
[09:25:38] <decx> it's mostly just adding classes and associated css
[09:25:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's what i thought.
[09:25:49] <Technodrome> https://jqueryui.com/button/#default
[09:26:20] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/zTBIHI0.png
[09:26:22] <graphettion> That's a button you create yourself.
[09:26:25] <duch_kazatel> there's the rendered markup.
[09:26:31] <graphettion> jQuery UI just adds styles to it.
[09:26:40] <graphettion> You will add the <input> tag.
[09:26:44] <Technodrome> but you still have to create the markup?
[09:26:48] <graphettion> Yes.
[09:26:54] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome it depends on which of those three buttons.
[09:26:54] <Technodrome> ah
[09:26:59] <Technodrome> oh
[09:27:06] <duch_kazatel> click the "view source" and compare against the rendered markup.
[09:27:12] <Technodrome> i thought it was like generating it or something
[09:27:16] <duch_kazatel> that's a <button> an <input> and an <a>
[09:27:27] <Technodrome> yes
[09:27:36] <duch_kazatel> the <button> gets an added span to it as well as some classes.
[09:27:36] <graphettion> No, that's not the case in this example.
[09:27:41] <Technodrome> it just applied style to the button you made right?
[09:27:41] <duch_kazatel> the input just gets classes.
[09:27:41] <Doddlin> JSLint is not for debugging, right?
[09:27:45] <graphettion> You create the markup in this example.
[09:27:52] <Technodrome> ah
[09:27:55] <duch_kazatel> the <a> gets an added span and some css.
[09:28:05] <duch_kazatel> graphettion right, but jqui also injects markup.
[09:28:05] <Technodrome> I see
[09:28:25] <graphettion> Understand, but not this example
[09:28:30] <duch_kazatel> Doddlin no.  jslint tells you if your code is formatted.
[09:28:32] <graphettion> graphettion  No, that's not the case in this example.
[09:28:35] <graphettion> What I wrote above
[09:29:01] <duch_kazatel> graphettion uh, i'm looking at the rendered markup and i'm seeing things that are not on the source.
[09:29:06] <duch_kazatel> unless i'm missing what you're saying.
[09:29:18] <Doddlin> member:duch_kazatel ah, ok
[09:29:20] <Doddlin> oops
[09:29:20] <graphettion> What do you see that's injected on that page?
[09:29:33] <graphettion> https://jqueryui.com/button/#default
[09:29:36] <Doddlin> are there any avail tool to find errors?
[09:29:45] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/ot5FJro.png
[09:29:49] <duch_kazatel> there's the rendered output.
[09:29:49] <Technodrome> so about jquery moving towards this idea of widgets? what do you mean by that?
[09:29:55] <duch_kazatel> *jquery ui
[09:30:15] <duch_kazatel> compare that rendered markup against the "source" they supply on that page: http://i.imgur.com/nVS1JkE.png
[09:30:16] <graphettion> Ah, yeah. I see what you mean.
[09:30:32] <graphettion> Yeah, jQuery does that naturally. You're right.
[09:30:39] <duch_kazatel> *jquery ui
[09:30:40] <graphettion> It adds class attributes.
[09:30:42] <duch_kazatel> jquery avoids doing that.
[09:30:47] <graphettion> jQuery UI I mean.
[09:30:49] <graphettion> You're right.
[09:30:51] <graphettion> My mistake.
[09:30:55] <duch_kazatel> jqui is also adding a child span to two of those elements :)
[09:31:04] <graphettion> Damn you!
[09:31:07] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:31:09] <graphettion> *hides in cave*
[09:31:12] <graphettion> hehe
[09:31:15] <graphettion> Good eye
[09:31:23] <Technodrome> so thats widgets thig, how is that different from what htey have now?
[09:31:56] <graphettion> duch_kazatel: I'll hit the button, sigh - http://www.sadtrombone.com/
[09:32:51] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome afaik, they want to make it a little more platform agnostic and less "heavy handed"
[09:33:16] <Technodrome> what does that mean though?
[09:33:18] <Technodrome> widgets?
[09:33:25] <duch_kazatel> datepickers, cutom buttons, etc.
[09:33:28] <Technodrome> so like, all the markup is generated?
[09:33:50] <decx> move away from a giant core and focus on reusable separate entities, or widgets
[09:33:56] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[09:34:01] <duch_kazatel> decx is better at that than i am.
[09:34:08] <Technodrome> ah
[09:34:09] <decx> ^^
[09:34:26] <Technodrome> I see, interesting
[09:35:06] <duch_kazatel> while jquery mobile is moving away from supplying any sort of user controls/widgets/entities and more towards simply providing an abstraction layer for mobile browsers.
[09:40:40] <bfred> r
[09:40:53] <duch_kazatel> s
[09:40:59] <bfred> :D
[09:41:41] <BillCriswell> remysharp: I just forked jsbin in an attempt to add descriptions and sure enough it pops up on my screen today.
[09:41:43] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: just out of my personal curiousity , what backend language do you use?
[09:42:31] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome that's a loaded question :) there's what i have to work in, and what i'd rather work in.
[09:42:44] <bfred> .then() only seems to accept a function that returns a deferred.
[09:42:45] <bfred> How can I pass it a deferred and have it wait?
[09:42:45] <bfred> Example. waitForSomething().then(waitForThisDfd).then(callThisFn);
[09:42:51] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: you work in PHP ? :)
[09:42:57] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:43:05] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome the company I'm at uses java as our backend with a ColdFusion middleware layer.
[09:43:06] <Technodrome> what do you rather work in?
[09:43:12] <Technodrome> oh
[09:43:19] <Technodrome> how is the java setup?
[09:43:27] <Technodrome> old style servlets, or using spring framework or something like that?
[09:43:28] <Ownix> With JQuery validation, if someone disables Javascript how do you stop them from submitting bad data?
[09:43:42] <duch_kazatel> i can't remember what framework.  i think it's spring.
[09:43:48] <duch_kazatel> it's our data services layer.  it handles all our business logic.
[09:43:54] <duch_kazatel> Ownix you don't.
[09:43:57] <Technodrome> spring mvc 3 is not that bad, its like rails a little
[09:44:01] <Technodrome> 1 and 2 was hell though
[09:44:04] <duch_kazatel> Ownix you should have server-side validation always.
[09:44:20] <Technodrome> what generates the html? coldfusion?
[09:44:24] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:44:25] <Technodrome> ah
[09:44:32] <Technodrome> so probalby just spring framework, no mvc
[09:44:33] <duch_kazatel> we hate it.
[09:44:49] <duch_kazatel> but it's a big legacy app and when we tried to replace it we had nothing but problems.
[09:44:52] <Technodrome> they probably started this before spring mvc even came out
[09:44:52] <duch_kazatel> so it's here to stay for a while.
[09:45:07] <Technodrome> what do you prefer to use?
[09:45:16] <duch_kazatel> Node.
[09:45:29] <duch_kazatel> honestly, anything but coldfusion or PHP\
[09:45:39] <Technodrome> i use django
[09:45:52] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, we use Spring MVC for some things.
[09:45:58] <duch_kazatel> i like python and django.
[09:46:05] <Cork> Ownix: js validation is for making things pretty, the server side is for security
[09:46:11] <Technodrome> i spent a year as a rails dev, 5 years as a java dev
[09:46:19] <Cork> and those two never mix
[09:46:23] <Technodrome> and for the life of me, nothing can give me the productivty that django has
[09:46:25] <duch_kazatel> Cork++
[09:46:35] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome i liked the modularity of django.
[09:46:48] <Technodrome> you have everything ‚Äúin the box‚Äù but its still modular
[09:47:02] <Technodrome> unlike rails which is like , ‚Äúthe app is running, just add onto it ‚Äú
[09:47:05] <duch_kazatel> yep.  and you can replace anything/everything.
[09:47:06] <Cork> Technodrome: if you want to feel productivity go down the drain, support a customized drupal site
[09:47:13] <duch_kazatel> drupal :(
[09:47:24] <Technodrome> ah , i‚Äôve done drupal too, actually working on a drupal project right now
[09:47:32] <Cork> and by customized i mean more then just random plugins + theme
[09:47:47] <Technodrome> yeah
[09:47:51] <Technodrome> i‚Äôve seen it all in that area for sure
[09:48:02] <Cork> Technodrome: i wrote a companis product site in drupal once
[09:48:04] <Technodrome> people think by using drupal they save time
[09:48:18] <Cork> had to create big product selectors and get the menu to work the way they liked and so on
[09:48:21] <Technodrome> but in django , i‚Äôm super fast
[09:48:38] <Technodrome> trust me, i know, last year i did around 20 drupal migrations
[09:48:46] <Technodrome> i‚Äôve seen it all :P
[09:48:48] <Cork> it was less tweaking and more running around with a bulldozer
[09:48:55] <duch_kazatel> Cork hahahah.  isn't that PHP ;)
[09:49:06] <Cork> duch_kazatel: basterdized php ya
[09:49:12] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2012/06/6a0120a85dcdae970b017742d249d5970d-800wi.jpg
[09:49:14] <Technodrome> what version of drupal was this?
[09:49:18] <Cork> if you ever look into drupal core you want to run
[09:49:19] <Technodrome> 8 is getitng better
[09:49:22] <Technodrome> and 7 isn‚Äôt *that* bad
[09:49:32] <Cork> tech 4 5 and 6
[09:49:38] <Technodrome> 4  5 and 6?
[09:49:44] <Technodrome> i mean
[09:49:51] <Technodrome> 6 is where it got real popular
[09:49:52] <Cork> it was updated :)
[09:49:56] <Technodrome> but
[09:50:00] <Technodrome> 4 and 5 were a *mess*
[09:50:18] <Cork> just as 6 was released we stopped with contracting
[09:50:18] <BillCriswell> Drupal makes me sads.
[09:50:25] <Cork> ya
[09:50:25] <BillCriswell> Mostly cause I dont' know what it's doing half the time.
[09:50:31] <Technodrome> now I will tell you a secret
[09:50:47] <Technodrome> if you want an easy few million a year, a drupal agency is the way to go
[09:50:52] <Cork> BillCriswell: it is customizable as long as you only customize what they planed you to costumize
[09:50:59] <Technodrome> i‚Äôve worked for a few drupal agencies
[09:51:07] <Cork> if you ever need to override something else you basically have to clone the entire core...
[09:51:16] <Technodrome> not in 7+
[09:51:23] <Technodrome> but yes, its still horrible
[09:51:27] <Cork> haven't use anything after 7 yet
[09:51:59] <Cork> i remembered a bug that existed in 4 we found it close to 5 release
[09:52:01] <Technodrome> i did a drupal project in january, was around 40k for one month worth the work
[09:52:06] <Cork> wrote a patch for it
[09:52:16] <Technodrome> to use django to do that
[09:52:29] <Cork> and then it bitrot in the review queue until they won't fixed it when they released 6
[09:52:37] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: Was it worth it?
[09:52:40] <Technodrome> you need, to have a reputation and alot of convicning , because so many organizations just jumpt to drupal right away
[09:52:41] <Cork> and it was a patch to make the search indexing work...
[09:52:48] <Technodrome> BillCriswell:  sure, it wasn‚Äôt that bad
[09:52:52] <Cork> (it was completely broken pre 6)
[09:53:07] <Technodrome> drupal was written by some real newbs early on
[09:53:23] <Technodrome> the girl who wrote CCK never programmed in her life
[09:53:35] <d0de> I'm using a setTimeout to move the position of a slider every 1000ms. As a result, the movement is jerky. I don't want to decrease the timeout for performance reasons - is there something I could use to animate the movement of the slider handle smoothly?
[09:54:22] <Technodrome> and CCK is the *heart* of drupal
[09:54:30] <d0de> it's a jQuery-mobile slider
[09:54:38] <duch_kazatel> css
[09:54:57] <Cork> d0de: you could try using css3 transisions
[09:55:28] <Cork> d0de: though that won't change the value for js
[09:55:42] <Technodrome> but if you ever dont know how to make some money, drupal is an easy way, i was employee number #2 and #3 and 2 firms, both have revenues above 5 million today, and none of them are special
[09:56:13] <d0de> well it's fine for the value to only update once a second, it's just the visual aspect I'm concerned about. I'll look into hooking in a css3 transition, thanks
[09:56:30] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: What kind of things did you need to do for the January project?
[09:56:54] <Technodrome> it was just a simple drupal site with a SOLR search backend
[09:57:04] <Cork> d0de: then look into css3 transisions
[09:57:11] <Cork> ?mdn transisions
[09:57:12] <b-ot> Cork: Using CSS transitions - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions
[09:58:03] <d0de> Cork, the only problem I can see is that I'd need to know the absolute final position of the slider handle, wouldn't I? And in the JS, all I know is that the handle value is changing from 0.71 to 0.72 or whatever
[09:58:23] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: We're currently doing one based around events, the client wants repeatable events but the repeatable events might happen at different times with excludable dates and things. The whole thing seems crazy to me.
[09:58:30] <Cork> d0de: no
[09:58:52] <BillCriswell> The form alone is terrifying let alone the logic begind it.
[09:59:05] <Cork> d0de: how are you moving the slider handle now?
[09:59:14] <Cork> percent?
[09:59:49] <d0de> well it's a jQuery-mobile slider, so for the slider foo all I do is foo.val( newValue ) and then foo.slider( 'refresh')
[09:59:50] <Cork> d0de: so all you do is every 1000 you set a new value and you let css transision smooth out the move from the first to the second
[10:00:23] <Technodrome> but a successful firm who is known for making great products , say with django or rails or something, really can create great *data* backends, analytics for companies, internal web applications , etc etc , you can do 25 million+ a year
[10:00:30] <Technodrome> and there isn‚Äôt many of these sadly enough
[10:00:51] <BillCriswell> On top of drupal?
[10:01:05] <Hypnotizes> can someone help me with my super difficult question :(
[10:01:15] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Hypnotizes
[10:01:15] <b-ot> Hypnotizes: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:01:15] <Technodrome> no no BillCriswell
[10:01:19] <BillCriswell> Oh, phew.
[10:01:21] <Technodrome> drupal is the easy route
[10:01:25] <BillCriswell> Duh, you said djano and rails
[10:01:27] <d0de> Cork, ok, I see, that sounds fairly simple. Is 'transform' the relevant property?
[10:01:45] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: See. I think I'd be more comfortable most the time going from scratch or a way less serious CMS.
[10:01:52] <Technodrome> to make a quick few million a year, i‚Äôm saying, if you really ahve strong skill sets, build a great team with an eye for design, you‚Äôll do even 10x better
[10:02:09] <Hypnotizes> listen duch_kazatel. I have this construction html > body > div > ul > li > I click for example the second one.
[10:02:10] <BillCriswell> I heard someone describe Drupal as a content management framework instead of a system and I thought that made perfect sense.
[10:02:19] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Hypnotizes
[10:02:19] <b-ot> Hypnotizes: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:02:20] <Hypnotizes> I would to return the path
[10:02:31] <Technodrome> i‚Äôm working on somethng right now actually, started out as an enterprise java app, old servlet thing, i‚Äôm 4 days in, django + twitter bootstrap etc, and i‚Äôm 80 percent done BillCriswell
[10:02:39] <Technodrome> with drupal 3 months no less
[10:02:57] <Technodrome> yes Drupal is a CMF but that doens‚Äôt change that it‚Äôs not ideal for custom things
[10:03:01] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: I dont have any code yet
[10:03:10] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes then start?
[10:03:10] <Technodrome> but people get scared of custom things, and people think drupal does 80 percent what they want, which it does not
[10:03:22] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: Got ya. I just can't get into it. I'm really trying it.
[10:03:29] <Cork> d0de: something like transition: left 1s linear;
[10:03:31] <Cork> should work
[10:03:41] <Technodrome> BillCriswell: drupal has a high learning curve too
[10:03:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/h2FCx/ - Hypnotizes something like this?
[10:03:48] <Cork> d0de: don't forget to set it as a class on the element while you animate it
[10:03:56] <Cork> d0de: and remove it when you don't
[10:04:01] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: Its a proxy.
[10:04:08] <Cork> d0de: else it will behave strange when users interact with it
[10:04:09] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: Yeah, going through that now. Can't say I'm a fan of anything about it and I'm usually a pretty positive person.
[10:04:26] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes wat?
[10:04:45] <d0de> Cork, thank you, testing now. Is it OK to remove the class before the transition has completed?
[10:04:59] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: when I click at one of the elements. I want to return the whole path from top to the element I have clicked
[10:05:26] <Technodrome> you might find this funny BillCriswell
[10:05:27] <Technodrome> http://cdn.sixrevisions.com/0372-02_cms_learning_curve.jpg
[10:05:41] <Technodrome> lol @ the crosses
[10:06:26] <Technodrome> its fair to say when it comes to PHP, drupal is the most complicated thing you‚Äôll ever run into with some complex zend framework apps being a close second
[10:06:34] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes okay - why do you think you need that?
[10:06:44] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: Haha
[10:06:52] <BillCriswell> Perfect.
[10:07:13] <Technodrome> but if you are a small firm, drupal can‚Äôt be ignored
[10:08:03] <Technodrome> and events in drupal is one of the it‚Äôs weakest points
[10:08:16] <Technodrome> and events are very common for many so called ‚Äúdrupal sites‚Äù
[10:08:31] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: a bot. I want to save the path of the element I clicked and look at the value of the element every day
[10:09:10] <Cork> d0de: no i think that will break the transision
[10:09:22] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes so you want the xpath of it?
[10:09:34] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: I work with someone who is very good with Drupal so that helps a lot, but it's very nice to be able to arrive at things yourself once in a while.
[10:10:26] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: Yes
[10:11:09] <Hypnotizes> that is one way
[10:12:33] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes huh?  one way?  do you want the CSS path instead?  because those are very different.
[10:12:55] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes you can use firebug or chrome's dev tools to get an xpath.  no code needed.
[10:13:39] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: I think I found what I need http://davecardwell.co.uk/javascript/jquery/plugins/jquery-getpath/
[10:13:52] <Cork> duch_kazatel: you don't want xpath
[10:13:58] <Cork> you want the css selector for the element
[10:14:06] <duch_kazatel> Cork looking at what he wants, i think he does.
[10:15:05] <Cork> man i wish those tools would start using css selectors
[10:15:13] <Cork> xpath is so freaking slow
[10:16:18] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4j6Zx/ - give me the css path of the second li :)
[10:16:41] <duch_kazatel> because the xpath is /html/body/div/ul/li[2]
[10:17:37] <duch_kazatel> derp nth-child
[10:17:42] <Cork> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/4j6Zx/1/
[10:17:52] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:17:55] <Cork> :)
[10:18:00] <duch_kazatel> forgot about that one.
[10:18:05] <duch_kazatel> you win.  jerk.
[10:18:20] <Cork> but yes if you move back before css2.1 xpath was clearly needed
[10:18:34] <Cork> after 2.1 you can do basically everything xpath can
[10:18:39] <duch_kazatel> aye
[10:18:39] <Cork> but like 50 times faster
[10:19:22] <Cork> and now they're talking about compiling css to bytecode :)
[10:19:41] <snover> ‚Äúafter 2.1 you can do basically everything xpath can‚Äù spoken like someone that has truly never used xpath before
[10:20:00] <Cork> snover: i've used xpath a lot
[10:20:04] <Hypnotizes> but the script i found doesnt seem to work? http://jsfiddle.net/h2FCx/2/
[10:20:26] <Cork> snover: and yes i used the term a bit loos
[10:20:33] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes look at your console
[10:20:40] <snover> i said ‚Äúlike‚Äù :)
[10:21:01] <duch_kazatel> class = this.attr('class');
[10:21:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Oooo... careful with that.
[10:22:00] <duch_kazatel> i know.
[10:22:00] <Cork> do it the rails way class => klass :)
[10:22:07] <duch_kazatel> i was telling him why it doesn't work.
[10:22:09] <Hypnotizes> lol
[10:22:27] <BillCriswell> You can expect me to read three lines up.
[10:22:44] <duch_kazatel> nah why bother :)
[10:22:44] <duch_kazatel> guys
[10:23:04] <duch_kazatel> i need access file on hard drive javascript
[10:23:24] <duch_kazatel> we haven't had one of those in a while.
[10:23:48] <BillCriswell> Give it a minute I'm sure.
[10:23:49] <d0de> would something like $('.my-class').removeClass( 'foo' ) remove the class foo from all memebrs of .my-class, or just the first member?
[10:23:51] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, hah
[10:24:03] <Cork> d0de: all
[10:24:14] <BillCriswell> WHy can't I get the real path to the users private files?
[10:24:22] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[10:24:30] <Cork> d0de:  $('.my-class').first().removeClass( 'foo' ) would only affect the first one
[10:24:45] <d0de> Cork, thanks
[10:25:10] <Cork> BillCriswell: heh ya, that would be nice
[10:25:13] <Cork> ...
[10:25:13] <Hypnotizes> btw, why is this vulnerable? class = this.attr('class');
[10:25:27] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes it's not "vulnerable" - you can't use the class keyword.
[10:25:32] <duch_kazatel> it's reserved
[10:25:45] <Cork> Hyperking: class is reserved for future spec implementations
[10:26:09] <Cork> ecmascript 6 to be precise
[10:26:14] <Cork> (harmony)
[10:27:09] <BillCriswell> $darkgry... I'm glad they left out that a in the variable name.
[10:27:31] <Hypnotizes> hmm, how should you get the class element? what is the other way?
[10:27:48] <Cork> Hyperking: class element?
[10:27:56] <Cork> you mean class attribute?
[10:28:03] <Hypnotizes> sorry yes
[10:28:08] <Cork> elm.getAttribute('class')
[10:28:12] <Cork> or elm.className
[10:31:30] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes the issue is the use of "class" as the variable name.
[10:31:47] <CrowX-> Technodrome, did I read that right? someone paid you 40k for one month of work?
[10:32:00] <Technodrome> it was a fixed price contract
[10:32:05] <Technodrome> it could have taken 2 or 3 months
[10:32:09] <Technodrome> just so happeend, it took one
[10:33:25] <CrowX-> Technodrome, if you don't mind telling, what kind of functionalities did the project contain?
[10:33:32] <CrowX-> i.e. what kind of project costs 40k
[10:33:39] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: can you check this http://jsfiddle.net/h2FCx/3/
[10:33:40] <BillCriswell> $55 dollars an hour if you worked 24/7 on it haha
[10:33:41] <Technodrome> it was an implementation of CiviCRM
[10:33:53] <Technodrome> it wasn‚Äôt an hourly project, fixed price
[10:34:06] <BillCriswell> I still like thinking about things hourly for fun.
[10:34:18] <Technodrome> #first problem
[10:34:18] <Technodrome> lol
[10:34:32] <BillCriswell> Only when I'm talking about other people's money.
[10:34:43] <Technodrome> 100 an hour is normal for many firms, a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù rate, 120 or 140 is usually the charged rate
[10:35:00] <CrowX-> wow
[10:35:02] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes i all ready told you what line the problem is on.
[10:35:14] <BillCriswell> I was friends with a stripper, she made like $300 an hour on a good night.
[10:35:15] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes don't use class as that var name - replace it.
[10:35:33] <Hypnotizes> xD with whaaatttt?
[10:35:44] <duch_kazatel> something that's not a reserved word?
[10:35:54] <BillCriswell> Hypnotizes: className, klass, classy, classhole
[10:35:54] <Technodrome> and for things like CRM basesd stuff, things where you work with actual real busiensses, its not uncommon to see 160 - 200 charged, and if you want, ask the java guys what the firms they work for charge, 200+ an hour easily
[10:35:57] <Hypnotizes> so any word?
[10:36:01] <Hypnotizes> okayyy
[10:36:09] <BillCriswell> clas
[10:36:15] <Technodrome> then when you get into IBM and all the top tier solutions providers CrowX-  , you will see 300-400+ an hour
[10:36:18] <duch_kazatel> theClass
[10:36:30] <duch_kazatel> but update everywhere that uses that var name.
[10:36:40] <duch_kazatel> there are three i can see.
[10:36:43] <Technodrome> CrowX-:  suggestion: appear as top tier as you possibly can from day one!
[10:37:38] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes theres also a syntax error in there, too.
[10:37:41] <CrowX-> I get 5$ an hour, and we're not counting the time I waste on mistakes and learning cause I'm new at these stuff, i.e. every project I get gets a fixed price at the beginning, calculated as $5 of the assumed number of hours it would take a professional :)
[10:37:47] <duch_kazatel> but i'll let you figure that one out
[10:37:58] <Technodrome> CrowX-: where are you from?
[10:38:03] <CrowX-> macedonia
[10:38:11] <Technodrome> 5 an hour is below min wage here
[10:38:19] <duch_kazatel> way below min wage.
[10:38:24] <Technodrome> yes, make more at subway
[10:38:52] <CrowX-> Technodrome, well the living standard is lower here, so if I was making a full time $5 per hour I could live very well off it
[10:39:02] <Technodrome> crazy
[10:39:24] <Technodrome> you can get better pay in mexico
[10:39:31] <CrowX-> lol
[10:39:51] <Technodrome> so serious
[10:39:58] <CrowX-> the payment is fine, not getting enough projects is what makes it even lower, and that's what hurts
[10:40:05] <Technodrome> min wage in mexico is 5.18 an hour usd
[10:40:28] <Technodrome> and most employers for low end jobs will pay like 6 an hour
[10:40:49] <Hypnotizes> its working http://jsfiddle.net/h2FCx/6/
[10:41:10] <CrowX-> also, the positive  thing is that I get to work from home
[10:41:24] <Technodrome> what languages do you know?
[10:41:28] <Technodrome> still man, 5 an hour
[10:41:37] <duch_kazatel> COL is different.
[10:41:45] <Technodrome> do you know python CrowX-  ?
[10:42:50] <duch_kazatel> ugh extreme regression testing.
[10:42:52] <duch_kazatel> i hate this stuff.
[10:44:28] <CrowX-> Technodrome, yes. I even messed with django a bit
[10:44:29] <d0de> should I be able to select html as an element with $('html') ? it doesn't seem to be workin
[10:44:38] <duch_kazatel> d0de huh?
[10:44:44] <duch_kazatel> d0de you meant he html element?
[10:44:52] <Technodrome> CrowX-: what is the min wage in macedonia?
[10:45:04] <Technodrome> and how old are you? just curious!
[10:45:22] <d0de> duch_kazatel, yes, the html element
[10:45:28] <duch_kazatel> d0de that should work.
[10:46:06] <CrowX-> Technodrome, 224usd per month is the minimum wage
[10:46:17] <CrowX-> but some people like janitors work for less
[10:46:27] <Technodrome> jeesh man
[10:46:32] <CrowX-> $150 per month
[10:46:38] <Technodrome> in brazil, its 400 usd a month
[10:46:41] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- do you find you have a good quality of life?
[10:47:01] <Technodrome> how can macedonia be so close to western europe and have such a bad economy
[10:47:38] <CrowX-> Technodrome, I just saw you asked me what languages I know. I know c++ and java the best, then python and php. And I lately got into javacript and jquery, which is what this job is about.
[10:47:41] <Technodrome> the balkans have always been rough
[10:48:00] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, yeah, I mean everything is cheaper around here
[10:48:06] <duch_kazatel> that's what i thought.
[10:48:10] <Technodrome> i‚Äôve been to romania , it was bad there too
[10:48:20] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome how much somebody makes is a terrible indicator of quality of life.
[10:48:35] <Technodrome> well many things, prices do change, but some things they don‚Äôt :)
[10:49:07] <Technodrome> on romania, food and stuff was cheap, some other types of things
[10:49:17] <Technodrome> but electronics or computers etc, same price + more
[10:49:43] <duch_kazatel> looks like macedonia is slowly gaining, too.
[10:50:23] <CrowX-> gaining what
[10:50:41] <Technodrome> i‚Äôm pissed right now, because i‚Äôm not the owner of an agency making 20 million a year
[10:50:46] <Technodrome> maybe i could be more thankful
[10:51:20] <duch_kazatel> GDP growth, not a terrible inflation rate either.
[10:51:30] <duch_kazatel> high unemployment and poverty, but those are improving.
[10:51:40] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: I've never had the desire to own an agency.
[10:51:45] <Technodrome> i think the balkans are just a mess
[10:51:50] <BillCriswell> Mostly just like working when I don't hate the project.
[10:51:58] <Technodrome> in romania / serbia, laws had little bearing on what people do
[10:52:12] <Technodrome> there were 9th graders like working as prostitutes n shit
[10:52:15] <CrowX-> gdp is pumped fakely
[10:52:23] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- ah.
[10:52:36] <CrowX-> 60% of all employed people are employed in government funded institutions
[10:53:12] <Technodrome> in 9th grade i was just figuring out things
[10:53:45] <CrowX-> which get funded either from debt, or from taxing and punishing the half-living firms we have
[11:03:56] <d0de> do mousedown() and mouseup() work for touch events?
[11:04:51] <NoiseEee> no, but there's touchStart and touchEnd
[11:06:42] <Forbidd3n> Cork: you around?
[11:19:52] <d0de> mousedown() and mouseup() should fire for every click or touch event, right?
[11:21:50] <duch_kazatel> d0de do you want the click, or the mouseup/mousedown?
[11:22:28] <BillCriswell> d0de: NoiseEee mentioned, I think you missed it, but there's touchStart and touchEnd
[11:22:42] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I want to do one thing on mousedown and another on mouse up
[11:22:43] <BillCriswell> It sucks they missed the change to use touchDown and touchUp.
[11:22:54] <BillCriswell> missed the chance
[11:22:56] <d0de> billCriswell, oh, ok, thanks
[11:22:59] <duch_kazatel> d0de check out using .on() instead.
[11:23:05] <d0de> yeah I was disconnected for a minute there
[11:23:14] <duch_kazatel> .on('mousedown touchstart', function(){});
[11:24:24] <MikeD_> how do I add a ul, an li (inside the ul), and a button (inside the li) with a click handler in one chained statement?
[11:24:50] <diphtherial> hey, not sure where i'd ask this, but i'm looking for a nice datetime range picker that represents the interval as a double-headed slider (hopefully that makes sense)
[11:25:03] <d0de> when something is bound to an element, is the z-index important?
[11:25:36] <diphtherial> i've looked at a few, and would prefer something like this but with automatic tick-mark generation: http://ghusse.github.io/jQRangeSlider/
[11:25:53] <BillCriswell> d0de: It can be for sure. You might not be able to trigger an event because it's below another but doesn't seem it.
[11:26:06] <d0de> Bill crisswell, oh bother.
[11:26:12] <Dirkos> this is triggered when entering the context menu: $('.item').mouseleave(function(){
[11:26:15] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ .append() should help.
[11:26:16] <Dirkos> is there a way not todo it?
[11:26:38] <duch_kazatel> Dirkos bind differently?
[11:26:52] <Dirkos> duch_kazatel: like?
[11:27:03] <duch_kazatel> Dirkos can you fiddle up what you're doing.
[11:27:05] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: If you're appending items you should be using event delegation to be listening for clicks on the button, so I'd just append the the html.
[11:27:09] <d0de> I suppose I could bind to all child elements? something like $('#parent *').on('mousedown touchstart'
[11:27:22] <duch_kazatel> d0de use event delegation instead.
[11:27:25] <BillCriswell> d0de: Use event delegation instead.
[11:27:27] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[11:27:28] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('event'
[11:27:36] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function(){});
[11:27:37] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[11:27:38] <duch_kazatel> i win.
[11:28:27] <mojo-jojo> Hi guys, please check out this code - http://jsfiddle.net/Dsjwn/2/ I want to be able to hide the button when all checkboxes are deselected
[11:28:28] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://jsbin.com/hagenoqi/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:28:29] <d0de> duch_kazatel, sorry for being slow but what would be 'child' in that example? a css selector?
[11:28:37] <duch_kazatel> d0de yep.
[11:28:48] <d0de> ok great, thanks
[11:28:48] <duch_kazatel> d0de a jquery selector, even.
[11:29:12] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo what button?
[11:29:25] <mojo-jojo> the button is hidden when document is ready
[11:29:39] <Dirkos> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/L3U6w/
[11:29:39] <mojo-jojo> clicking on any of the checkboxes will display it
[11:29:53] <Dirkos> in firefox the mouseleave is triggered when opening the context menu (right click)
[11:29:55] <Dirkos> in chrome it isnt
[11:30:08] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo i'm not seeing it....
[11:30:41] <mojo-jojo> duck_kazatel click on any of the checkboxes, it'll display the button. I hid the button by default
[11:30:55] <mojo-jojo> duch_kazatel click on any of the checkboxes, it'll display the button. I hid the button by default
[11:31:16] <mojo-jojo> sorry for the name typo
[11:31:33] <BillCriswell> mojo-jojo: http://jsbin.com/okijaj/3/edit I did this for an interview a while ago... Might be helpful.
[11:31:39] <MikeD_> seems like .on() is all-about the delegation... if I'm building a component with a lot of subsections with content/actions, should I delegate events to the subsection and let it detect what was clicked?
[11:31:42] <duch_kazatel> I cannot see a button in the fiddle you supplied.
[11:31:59] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ yea,
[11:32:43] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ delegation is nice because you can bind fewer listeners and handle them from there.  you can also change out the content of the thing you're bound do and not worry about re-binding anything.
[11:34:39] <d0de> duch_kazatel, can I unbind delegated events using the same syntax, $('parent').off('event', 'child') ?
[11:35:01] <duch_kazatel> d0de you can unbind, yes, but generally i reccommend that you don't do that if possible.
[11:36:15] <d0de> duch_kazatel, why is that please?
[11:37:19] <duch_kazatel> generally if you find yourself adding/removing listeners, it means you're approaching the problem a little... strange?
[11:38:05] <MikeD_> & a little strange is not a good approach
[11:38:16] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  makes things confusing.
[11:38:29] <mojo-jojo> duck_kazatel help pls?
[11:38:38] <mojo-jojo> duch_kazatel help pls?
[11:39:10] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo i can't see the button.
[11:39:50] <mojo-jojo> it'll display when you click on any of the checkboxes http://jsfiddle.net/Dsjwn/2/
[11:40:11] <duch_kazatel> and again - still not seeing it.
[11:40:25] <duch_kazatel> can anybody else see it?
[11:40:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I do not see it.
[11:40:33] <mojo-jojo> BillCriswell?
[11:40:33] <duch_kazatel> okay,'
[11:40:50] <BillCriswell> mojo-jojo?
[11:42:04] <d0de> duch, TY
[11:42:42] <mojo-jojo> duch_kazatel and BillCriswell
[11:42:48] <mojo-jojo> I just updated it
[11:42:50] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyyyy
[11:43:27] <BillCriswell> mojo-jojo: Still not working.
[11:43:39] <mojo-jojo> http://jsfiddle.net/Dsjwn/28/
[11:43:50] <BillCriswell> 28?
[11:43:53] <BillCriswell> You just sent 2 lol
[11:43:56] <duch_kazatel> woahdang
[11:44:00] <mojo-jojo> BillCriswell and duch_kazatel here's the updated link http://jsfiddle.net/Dsjwn/28/
[11:44:19] <d0de> duch_kazatel, perhaps if I tell you what I'm doing you can tell me if my approach makes sense? In my program there is a setting that oscillates the slider handles up and down. While this is happening, the user can still move the slider handles manually.
[11:44:48] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[11:44:51] <d0de> I want to add a transition to the automated oscillated movements to make them smoother, but not the manual movements. My solution is to add a transition class to the slider handles while the oscillation is going on, but remove it by binding the slider to touchstart and touchend
[11:45:02] <BillCriswell> Hahahahaha
[11:45:11] <duch_kazatel> yaaaay
[11:45:16] <d0de> i.e. touchstart removes the class and touchend adds it again
[11:45:54] <Bloomberg> How can I insert a onclick event inside of php tag
[11:46:22] <mojo-jojo> BillCriswell and duch_kazatel can you see it now?
[11:46:29] <duch_kazatel> d0de why not leave the handle alone but animate the inside?
[11:46:44] <Bloomberg> echo "<a onClick='my_event('data_to_pass')'>Anything</a>";
[11:46:52] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg don't do that.
[11:46:57] <duch_kazatel> bind using .on()
[11:47:37] <duch_kazatel> can anybody tell me if this perf test is valid? http://jsperf.com/regex-replace-vs-array-split-and-join
[11:48:12] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I'm not sure that would solve the problem, would it? the problem is that if the user clicks on the slider track while the handle has the transition class, the slider handle will animate to that position instead of jumping there instantly, as it should
[11:48:34] <duch_kazatel> d0de could you setup a fiddle demonstrating?
[11:48:53] <sonderr> Hey all, I'm relatively inexperienced with Jquery but I have this: http://pastebin.com/v7VMsE4j to give me a tool tip on hover. However, in some instances there is no image included..is there anyway I can prevent having a broken image showing up?
[11:49:08] <mojo-jojo> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/Dsjwn/28/ help pls
[11:49:16] <sonderr> I suppose I can just have a 1 pixel transparent image uploaded that would do the job..
[11:49:53] <MikeD_> is the .data() method acting on data-* attributes or on a custom jquery object?
[11:50:03] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ both, kinda.
[11:50:35] <BillCriswell> mojo-jojo: http://jsbin.com/okijaj/7/edit?js,output Does this help?
[11:50:43] <BillCriswell> Did this for a job interview a while ago.
[11:51:42] <mojo-jojo> BillCriswell checking it out
[11:52:02] <MikeD_> <button data-foo="bar">  [inside .on() handler] event.target.data("foo")  should return 'bar' - correct?
[11:52:06] <sonderr> Would my method of the 1 pixel transparent image be an unprofessional or unconventional way of doing it?
[11:52:24] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ you could also do $(this).data(')
[11:52:25] <MikeD_> 1px transparent images sounds like a web beacon
[11:52:30] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ you could also do $(this).data('foo')
[11:52:42] <duch_kazatel> sonderr because that's a hack that probably doesn't take care of the problem.
[11:52:58] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: $(event.target).data('foo'); event.target is just a dom node.
[11:53:14] <BillCriswell> I'd imagine $(this) would be the same thing though.
[11:53:22] <sonderr> duch_kazatel: I can't seem to find a way around it, although I've never written my own JQuery admittedly
[11:53:25] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is for .on() iirc.
[11:53:25] <sonderr> Or JS for that matter
[11:53:52] <duch_kazatel> sonderr are you able to setup a working example in a fiddlle?
[11:54:09] <sonderr> Let me give it a shot :)
[11:54:15] <BillCriswell> if they're just doing $('.foo').on('click', fn); then checking what element triggered it themselves it might need event.target?
[11:54:38] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell if you don't want the overhead of the jquery function, sure.
[11:55:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah that's what I'm thinking if they need event.target
[11:56:37] <sonderr> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Ux9yc/ I think I got it
[11:56:40] <MikeD_> right, I've delegated button clicks... and if there's more than one button... they have different actions
[11:56:59] <BillCriswell> There we go.
[11:57:11] <sonderr> Sorry for the gross HTML I grabbed it from Wordpress
[11:57:24] <MikeD_> i'm still getting used to jquery... the native event object target is a lot of manual effort... i assumed .data() was just a wrapper for data-* attributes
[11:57:28] <duch_kazatel> $(this).data('foo') should return the data of the clicked thinger
[11:57:43] <MikeD_> that's convenient  (which is the whole point)
[11:57:57] <duch_kazatel> sonderr so you're trying to handle the case where there is no image, right?
[11:58:03] <BillCriswell> Word.
[11:58:11] <sonderr> duch_kazatel: Yep, in that example it is A-1 Universal Care
[11:58:27] <duch_kazatel> what's wrong with what you have?  bad styling?
[11:59:14] <sonderr> Well no matter what it puts together an image and attempts to display it..which is a problem when there is no image to display
[11:59:28] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://jsbin.com/fehunabo/1/edit there we go.
[11:59:49] <duch_kazatel> sonderr oh test for the image first and if there is none output nothing.
[12:00:05] <duch_kazatel> depending on the use case, folks with use a "no image available" default instead.
[12:00:32] <sonderr> duch_kazatel: Considering I've no idea how to test for an image, best option might be a No Image Available :P
[12:01:26] <duch_kazatel> check the value of $(this).attr('data-image') and react accordingly?>
[12:02:19] <duch_kazatel> but again, it kind of depends on the use case.
[12:02:43] <sonderr> Hmm I've never messed with Jquery/JS but this may be a good learning experience.
[12:02:48] <duch_kazatel> there you go :)
[12:02:55] <sonderr> I'll mess with it and worst case scenario I can go No Image :)
[12:03:08] <duch_kazatel> that'll require largely the same strategy btw
[12:03:14] <sonderr> Thank you for your help :) You IRC helpers that still exist are a fascinating and extremely awesome group
[12:03:30] <sonderr> duch_kazatel: Oh? I would just put the image url as the not avaialble I upload
[12:03:38] <duch_kazatel> aaaah in the markup?
[12:03:40] <duch_kazatel> yeah okay
[12:03:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah "no image available" can be a terrible UX depending.
[12:03:59] <duch_kazatel> which is why i caution against it.
[12:06:02] <sonderr> Hmm, okay I'll give this my best shot. They've been without these tooltips for like a year now so I don't have to rush trying to figure it out
[12:07:52] <duch_kazatel> there are also plenty of tooltip libraries instead.
[12:09:52] <ph8> hi all. I'm looking to create a layout for 5 calendars. I have all the calendar data so it's purely a UI question, has anyone got any plugins they think i could use to display 5-15 calendars i'm envisaging calendar names down the left hand side of the screen and time across the top with google-calendar style bars to mark meetings
[12:10:31] <duch_kazatel> yeah - they call it "google calendar" :P
[12:13:00] <ph8> google calendar won't display multiple calendars separately for me
[12:13:02] <ph8> it only mixes them in
[12:13:10] <ph8> which is rubbish for the kind of 'heads up' meeting room display i'm trying to make
[12:13:23] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[12:13:42] <ph8> i've just described it more in a stack overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23118165/is-there-a-multiple-calendar-ui-layout-that-i-can-use-without-having-to-recreate
[12:13:51] <bengalo> does anyone have experience with server sent events with php on the server side?
[12:14:08] <duch_kazatel> you need to display multiple calendars on one page, ph8?
[12:14:19] <ph8> yes, but not all mushed into one column
[12:14:26] <ph8> each calendar needs to be distinct
[12:14:27] <sonderr> duch_kazatel: Are there tooltip libraries for Wordpress though?
[12:14:32] <ph8> so i envisage calendar names down the left hand side
[12:14:38] <ph8> maybe 3-4 hours showing at a time horizontally
[12:14:41] <sonderr> I don't know how dealing with WP is compared to just doing it from scratch
[12:14:44] <ph8> and blocks to repesent meetings (a-la google calendar)
[12:14:45] <duch_kazatel> ph8 do you have a visual design.
[12:15:07] <duch_kazatel> sonderr i like PowerTip, others have their own preferences.
[12:15:17] <duch_kazatel> just gotta output stuff in the right format.
[12:15:20] <ph8> Imagine it like a spreadsheet, calendars in column A e.g. 'meeting room 1', 'meeting room 2' and then time in B-X columns (11:00-15:00 for example)
[12:15:23] <ph8> just a grid
[12:15:39] <ph8> i know there's a lot of grid layout stuff out there, but a fully formed calendar widget would be nice
[12:15:46] <duch_kazatel> ph8 sorry, still having a hard time envisioning it.
[12:16:35] <sonderr> duch_kazatel: Should I be worried that it hasn't been updated in over a year?
[12:17:00] <sonderr> Warning: This plugin has not been tested with your current version of WordPress.
[12:17:08] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/stevenbenner/jquery-powertip
[12:17:15] <duch_kazatel> 3 days ago?
[12:17:36] <CrowX-> is accessing a cached element faster than accessing it by id?
[12:17:41] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- yes
[12:17:45] <CrowX-> k
[12:17:54] <sonderr> Oh I was looking at the Wordpress Plugin powerTip
[12:18:13] <ph8> duch_kazatel, it's not quite what i was described, but in google calendar if you go to 'create event' and then 'find a time' and add multiple meeting rooms, that view would be enough for me
[12:18:16] <CrowX-> does it pay off to cache an element if you only need to access it twice?
[12:18:25] <ph8> but for optimal space usage i was envisaging swapping the X and Y axis (so meeting rooms on the left)
[12:18:38] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- yes.
[12:18:48] <duch_kazatel> ph8 you mean "envisioning" i think.
[12:19:11] <duch_kazatel> ph8 you mean the "find a time" thing?
[12:19:23] <ph8> yep
[12:19:29] <duch_kazatel> interesting concept.
[12:19:36] <ph8> i think i meant envisage ;)
[12:19:40] <ph8> but almost same-same
[12:19:52] <ph8> i'd like to put one outside my meeting rooms
[12:19:59] <ph8> i'm a competent developer, but that also means i love reuse
[12:20:19] <ph8> i was going to open source it on github, but just want to do the minimum required work, so if there was a calendar layout plugin i could just load my data into that would be ideal
[12:20:22] <duch_kazatel> envisage is more for events, envision is for visualization.
[12:39:51] <sergey_> can anyone help with bug on JQuey UI tabs
[12:40:18] <Bloomberg> sergey : what?
[12:40:31] <sergey_> http://stela.ws/vignettes/item/rose-vignette.html?category_id=23
[12:40:39] <sergey_> here`s the bug
[12:41:09] <sergey_> if we`ll delete parameters in url - everything is ok
[12:41:27] <sergey_> I can`t understand logic
[12:42:29] <MikeD_> sergey_: that's suggesting a problem with serverside code
[12:42:54] <tucan> after upgrading jquery ui to latest version, my autocomplete list stopped working, and in the release notes i see the line "Autocomplete now uses ui-autocomplete-item instead of item.autocomplete"  What does this mean?
[12:43:26] <cek> hey, i need an "autocomplete", but with my custom results showup
[12:43:52] <cek> essentially a basic functionality that would fire an event and cancel ajax request if another character is typed
[12:44:20] <sergey_> <MikeD_> - where are parameters? I can`t find them
[12:44:42] <MikeD_> ?category_id=23 are parameters to the page
[12:45:37] <sergey_> i mean.. code is the same, but js works different

[13:00:58] <SamuraiDio> hi, how do I add options to the contructor of a widget?
[13:02:29] <Cork> SamuraiDio: what do you mean?
[13:02:56] <Cork> you mean add extra options or just the widgets options?
[13:03:21] <Gundalf> hi guys, I'm consufed, If I add jquery-mobile, do I need to add jquery too?
[13:03:48] <sergey_> problem solved. Now I use 1.8.21 insteed 1.9.2
[13:05:49] <SamuraiDio> Cork, here https://gist.github.com/e7ec522c9089b23bd365
[13:05:56] <Gundalf> I mean, is jquery-mobile just a jquery extended?
[13:06:09] <Gundalf> or it's only an extension
[13:06:33] <Cork> SamuraiDio: and what option is it your trying to pass?
[13:06:59] <Cork> aha
[13:07:49] <Fraz> hi
[13:07:56] <SamuraiDio> Cork, not decided yet, but there may be a lot
[13:08:04] <EdwardIII> hey, i don't know if anyone knows whether it's possible to make the epic select2 plugin pre-populate the lookahead-type dropdown?
[13:08:12] <Crippy> just a quick question, look for the correct terminology for when an ajax request is sent and via inspector I can see the Headers that show the request URL...
[13:08:14] <Gundalf> solved, thanks: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4119672/do-i-need-to-include-jquery-core-alongside-jquery-mobile
[13:08:16] <Crippy> looking*
[13:08:32] <EdwardIII> i want it to do an ajax lookup if the visitor clicks in and starts typing (fine) but i want to load a bunch of results by default to guide them
[13:08:35] <Fraz> http://pastebin.com/E3DRzP6G >> why does line 15 work but not line 18?
[13:09:51] <SamuraiDio> Cork, do I get then with this.options?
[13:10:00] <SamuraiDio> seens to work
[13:10:29] <Cork> SamuraiDio: let me check my old code
[13:10:35] <Cork> haven't fiddled with this for a while
[13:12:02] <Cork> SamuraiDio: yes that is correct
[13:12:13] <Cork> this.options is where you'll find the passed in options
[13:12:31] <Cork> and the target element is this.element
[13:14:13] <SamuraiDio> Cork, and the defaults are set with the `options` property, I've just found it.
[13:14:17] <SamuraiDio> Cork, Thanks
[13:14:27] <lieber> hello guys, I'm trying to use a simple script that fades throw news, here's the sample: http://jsfiddle.net/qJa3h/ - but instead of displaying strings like 'news1' or 'news2' a <a href> link, how can i implement that? I'm not a jquery programmer.
[13:14:59] <lieber> *I want to show links
[13:16:56] <Cork> lieber: http://jsfiddle.net/qJa3h/477/
[13:21:06] <Cork> lieber: and a slight code cleanup http://jsfiddle.net/qJa3h/478/
[13:22:02] <dave_s> Is it valid to do: $(['input', 'select'], target).each();?
[13:22:09] <Cork> no
[13:22:21] <Cork> $('input, select', target).each()
[13:25:08] <dave_s> Cork: Ah, I see. I was trying to use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-elementArray but I was missing the fact that the second argument is ommitted in that signature.
[13:25:48] <Cork> element array is if you have an array of elements
[13:25:55] <Cork> your not doing a selection if you do that
[13:26:02] <Cork> you are just wrapping
[13:27:01] <Cork> dave_s: and as selectors can do multiple selections, there isn't a need for that form
[13:27:20] <lieber> Cork: ty very much
[13:28:46] <dave_s> Cork: Thanks. I know a selector represents a collection in jQ, I just couldn't figure out how to get basically every form-field into my selection so I could clear it.
[13:29:15] <Cork> dave_s: no you misunderstood what i meant
[13:29:37] <Cork> dave_s: the string you give to jquery is exactly a css selector
[13:29:59] <dave_s> Right.
[13:30:01] <Cork> dave_s: so everything you can do in a stylesheet selector you can do there
[13:30:15] <Cork> plus a few extensions jquery add ontop
[13:30:52] <Cork> dave_s: to give a little background jquery depends on the browsers .querySelectorAll
[13:31:07] <Cork> so most of the selections arn't jquery, but the browsers native functions
[13:31:59] <dave_s> I'm not exactly a front-end guru, so I'm not wholly familliar with all the CSS selection magic.
[13:32:32] <BillCriswell> If you need to do anything too complicated you're probably doing something wrong anyway.
[13:33:56] <dave_s> Basically if Bootstrap didn't exist, I'd still be pumping out ugly UIs that make real designers want to stab me with a rusty butter knife.
[13:33:59] <dave_s> And twist.
[13:34:48] <Uhkis> and now you pump out overly used ugly UIs that make people wanna stab you :-)
[13:39:01] <BillCriswell> http://i.imgur.com/v946Pjy.jpg
[13:39:12] <BillCriswell> So funny.

[13:42:47] <BillCriswell> Haha pretty close.
[13:55:53] <tucan> http://jsfiddle.net/J8zwy/  could someone point at exactly what i need to edit here to make it work with jquery ui 1.10?   i dont know what it means by "Autocomplete now uses ui-autocomplete-item instead of item.autocomplete"
[15:05:07] <duch_kazatel> tucan are you getting a particular console error?
[15:23:36] <kshorter> clorith: ok, basically I've set the meta from featured image to display at the top of my post.
[15:23:53] <kshorter> now during the blog roll it shows the image twice

[15:37:26] <nightcracker> anyone here know how I can solve this issue with my dynamic scrolling sidebar? (I want the position to be absolute until the sidebar would be scrolled out of the window - then I want it to be fixed)
[15:37:44] <nightcracker> it works except for a very annoying "flash" of being out of position for one frame: http://gfycat.com/LimitedGoldenCaracal
[15:38:00] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ nightcracker

[15:38:16] <NCS_One> hi
[15:39:15] <nightcracker> duch_kazatel, give me a secod
[15:39:17] <nightcracker> second*
[15:39:55] <phelix> http://dev-yellowcabcom.gotpantheon.com/ Would someone be able to tell me why I am getting an "TypeError: Drupal.settings.flexslider_views_slideshow is undefined" line 19 on flexslider_views_slideshow.js file??
[15:40:03] <NCS_One> is there some simple way of knowing to position number of a clicked element? e.g.: have 10 DIVs, click on DIV 7 and know that the clicked DIV is number 7
[15:40:25] <NCS_One> s/to position/the position/
[15:41:07] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One sure. .index() can help.
[15:41:09] <duch_kazatel> buuut why?
[15:42:15] <nightcracker> duch_kazatel, do you mind if it's not a fully self-contained example?
[15:42:26] <duch_kazatel> nightcracker better than nothing i guess.
[15:43:13] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: for a image gallery, when a thumb is clicked I need to know which to show
[15:43:18] <nightcracker> duch_kazatel, https://gist.github.com/nightcracker/606ae5022bb23feaaf52
[15:43:26] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One use $(this) to get data.
[15:43:40] <nightcracker> actually, setting up a jsfiddle shouldn't be too hard
[15:44:15] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: for now I'm trying without data
[15:44:44] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One huh?
[15:44:56] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One why does the index mater for that?
[15:45:40] <phelix> TypeError: jQuery.easing[this.easing] is not a function in jquery-1.9.1.js any ideas whats causing this?
[15:46:18] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: didn't know how index worked and read it and realized it doesn't help
[15:46:49] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One how about you fiddle up your code?
[15:46:56] <duch_kazatel> phelix do you have jqueryui included?
[15:47:05] <phelix> let me check
[15:48:29] <Tomashe> hey guys
[15:48:34] <Tomashe> $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $(document).height() }, 50) why this isnt working
[15:49:08] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Do I want jquery-ui ?
[15:49:23] <duch_kazatel> phelix you'd need it or the easing pack iirc.
[15:49:43] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery easing
[15:49:45] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jQuery Easing Plugin - GSGD ‚Üí http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[15:49:55] <phelix> I have this. http://dev-yellowcabcom.gotpantheon.com/misc/ui/jquery.ui.core.min.js?v=1.8.7
[15:49:56] <duch_kazatel> easings are in jqui iirc.
[15:50:04] <duch_kazatel> dunno then.
[15:56:30] <tucan> duch_kazatel: hmmm i just checked again and it seems to just work
[15:56:46] <tucan> very odd
[15:56:50] <duch_kazatel> tucan okayu
[15:56:52] <duch_kazatel> *okay
[16:05:49] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/cWPNE/
[16:05:57] <cek> hey, i need an "autocomplete", but with my custom results showup
[16:06:01] <cek> essentially a basic functionality that would fire an event and cancel ajax request if another character is typed
[16:06:28] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One why are you using index?
[16:06:30] <duch_kazatel> that's hacky,
[16:06:48] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: using index? where?
[16:06:56] <duch_kazatel> "Is there some way of doing this without the "data-img"? Maybe knowing the position of a clicked element. "
[16:07:23] <duch_kazatel> why can't you use data attributes of some kind?
[16:08:27] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: this is for a plugin, if I use data attributes I will have to show the user how to use it and is more work for user
[16:08:42] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One that's a pretty reasonable requirement.
[16:08:43] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: are you familliar with xpath?
[16:09:00] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: for me its ok, I'm just trying to make it the more simple I can
[16:09:01] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes yep.
[16:09:17] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One you should require the data attributes.  trust me.
[16:09:52] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: do you maybe know how to call: ul > li:nth-child(2)
[16:09:55] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: thanks, I will use them :)
[16:10:16] <Hypnotizes> this is what i got now: descendant-or-self::ul/*/*[position()=2 and self::li]
[16:11:05] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes is this for the same thing you had before?
[16:11:18] <Hypnotizes> yes duch_kazatel
[16:11:43] <duch_kazatel> why aren't you using a page scraper or something?
[16:12:54] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: what is that?
[16:13:19] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes let's back up a whole lot - what are you checking each day
[16:13:19] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:14:02] <NCS_One> Hypnotizes: /ul/li[2]      does't work?
[16:14:06] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: it depens what you want :p
[16:14:22] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes are you building a page scraper?
[16:15:11] <Hypnotizes> "A scraper site is a website that copies all of its content from other websites using web scraping. The purpose of creating such a site can be to collect advertising revenue or to manipulate search engine rankings by linking to other sites to improve their search engine ranking."
[16:15:15] <Hypnotizes> not really
[16:15:44] <duch_kazatel> what are you building then?
[16:16:05] <duch_kazatel> and i'm talking about a scraping tool.
[16:16:16] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily a site that copies all content.
[16:17:54] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: something similar to this: http://anchetawern.github.io/blog/2013/08/07/getting-started-with-web-scraping-in-php/
[16:18:11] <Hypnotizes> so then yes it is one
[16:19:09] <NCS_One> Hypnotizes: /ul/li[2]      does't work?
[16:19:27] <Hypnotizes> NCS_One: wait
[16:19:58] <Hypnotizes> NCS_One: this one works: http://www.xpathtester.com/xpath/68402c2ab8d55e889153acbed83cb7fa
[16:20:08] <Hypnotizes> but without ul as parent
[16:21:08] <Hypnotizes> NCS_One: your code works
[16:32:30] <nightcracker> ok
[16:32:34] <nightcracker> I have a minimal jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/7FUqz/7/
[16:33:04] <nightcracker> however because jsfiddle uses iframes the problem does not occur within the "result" iframe - viewing the embedded page directly does show the issue though: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/7/show/light/
[16:33:30] <Starcraftmazter> i have this responsive design here, http://i.imgur.com/9iJjVUH.png
[16:33:35] <Starcraftmazter> when you click on one of the boxes, it pops up another box which is fine, but the positioning of the box in the dom needs to change with responsiveness
[16:33:38] <Starcraftmazter> does anyone know how this might be possible?
[16:37:14] <nightcracker> anyone? in case the issue is not clear I made a little video of the quirk in action (albeit on the original page, and not on this example, so don't mind the different text): http://gfycat.com/LimitedGoldenCaracal
[16:38:44] <duch_kazatel> i'm amazed i still have a liver
[16:39:08] <Hypnotizes> nightcracker: I dont see any weird things
[16:39:12] <Hypnotizes> it works pretty well
[16:39:20] <Hypnotizes> duch_kazatel: haha what did you do?
[16:42:56] <nightcracker> Hypnotizes: have you seen the video I linked? http://gfycat.com/LimitedGoldenCaracal
[16:43:08] <nightcracker> with gfycat you can look frame by frame, look at frame 33
[16:43:14] <Hypnotizes> nightcracker: yes, I dont have that problem
[16:43:56] <nightcracker> Hypnotizes: but clearly it is present, at least in chrome 34 on windows, what I use
[16:45:17] <Hypnotizes> nightcracker: Your script works pretty NIICEEE on my macbook pro retina :p
[16:46:00] <Hypnotizes> i am also using chrome
[16:46:26] <Hypnotizes> nightcracker: but you are not on jsfiddle?
[16:46:39] <nightcracker> Hypnotizes: don't test it out in jsfiddle iframe
[16:46:51] <nightcracker> because the iframe surpesses the symptomes
[16:46:58] <nightcracker> use the direct embedded link: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/7/show/light/
[16:46:59] <Hypnotizes> nightcracker: I did both
[16:47:16] <nightcracker> I get the effect on jsfiddle embedded link, but not in the iframe
[16:48:06] <nightcracker> hmm, mozilla aurora does not show the effect
[16:50:31] <Hypnotizes> nightcracker: can you test it in incognito modus?
[16:50:43] <Hypnotizes> ctrl + shift + n in chrome
[16:50:53] <nightcracker> I already said it also has the issue in incognito :)
[16:51:04] <Hypnotizes> ow
[16:51:08] <nightcracker> wait
[16:51:12] <nightcracker> I typed it out at least
[16:51:33] <nightcracker> welp, I think I didn't send the IRC message
[16:51:50] <nightcracker> anyway, I did try it out, and yes it also shows the symptomes with incognito
[16:52:10] <Hypnotizes> weird
[16:54:39] <nightcracker> if no one here knows, would you know maybe a better place to ask?
[16:56:59] <BillCriswell> nightcracker: What's the issue?
[16:57:37] <nightcracker> BillCriswell: I have a dynamic scrolling sidebar, but when it should start getting fixed it bugs out for a frame: http://gfycat.com/LimitedGoldenCaracal
[16:57:59] <nightcracker> this is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/7FUqz/7/
[16:58:18] <nightcracker> but in order to see the effect it musn't be in an iframe, so here's the embedded link: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/7/show/light/
[16:58:57] <nightcracker> note that I see the effect on Windows Chrome 34, but mozilla aurora doesn't show the issue on the same machine, nor did it show for Hypnotizes on mac (chrome)
[17:00:27] <duch_kazatel> oh that small glitchy thing?
[17:01:25] <nightcracker> duch_kazatel: yes
[17:01:27] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/7FUqz/8/embedded/result/ does it still happen here? If so I just blame windows being stupid.
[17:01:45] <duch_kazatel> nope.  that one works.
[17:01:53] <duch_kazatel> what'd you change?
[17:02:09] <duch_kazatel> ah, caching window?
[17:02:14] <BillCriswell> Yes
[17:02:15] <nightcracker> BillCriswell: no, that's using an iframe - this is the correct link: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/8/show/light/
[17:02:21] <nightcracker> and no, it's still broken
[17:02:26] <duch_kazatel> nights works for me.
[17:02:45] <duch_kazatel> err, nightcracker
[17:03:40] <Hypnotizes> nightcracker: how fast is your computer? maybe its your computer?
[17:04:24] <nightcracker> GPU is AMD R9 280x, CPU is Intel i5-4670k
[17:04:26] <duch_kazatel> Hypnotizes that shouldn't matter ;)
[17:05:29] <Hypnotizes> lol just to be sureee
[17:12:33] <BillCriswell> nightcracker: http://jsfiddle.net/7FUqz/9/embedded/result/ does it still happen here?
[17:12:45] <nightcracker> stop linking me broken links :P
[17:13:00] <nightcracker> http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/9/show/light/
[17:13:11] <BillCriswell> I don't think it makes a difference.
[17:13:17] <nightcracker> it does
[17:13:20] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[17:13:28] <nightcracker> the symptones do not occur if the page is in an iframe
[17:13:30] <nightcracker> mysteriously
[17:13:42] <nightcracker> http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/9/show/light/ still has the error
[17:13:48] <duch_kazatel> how in the hell is 8 now broken for me.
[17:13:48] <duch_kazatel> wtf.
[17:13:58] <nightcracker> you also get the effect?
[17:14:01] <nightcracker> I am seeing?
[17:14:03] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[17:14:07] <nightcracker> I AM NOT CRAZY
[17:14:10] <nightcracker> THANK YOU
[17:14:11] <nightcracker> :D
[17:14:23] <duch_kazatel> wonder if it's that it's recalculating things after the scroll has finished.
[17:14:39] <nightcracker> it is
[17:15:00] <duch_kazatel> the scroll function is doing quite a bit of work.
[17:15:02] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[17:15:28] <BillCriswell> I've seen this done a million times. How is it different this time.
[17:15:55] <BillCriswell> nightcracker: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements/ does it do it here for the top element that says "sticky"?
[17:16:14] <nightcracker> this might be relevant: http://i.imgur.com/yaru8f7.png
[17:17:03] <nightcracker> BillCriswell: yes it does, although it "flashes" (because the scroll would push it all the way off the page)
[17:18:47] <nightcracker> Hypnotizes: could you do a "Timeline" profile in chrome on http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/8/show/light/ and post a screenshot here?
[17:19:08] <BillCriswell> http://andrewhenderson.me/wp-content/tutorials/jquery-sticky-content/index.html here?
[17:19:25] <nightcracker> Hypnotizes: F12 > Timeline > Click record button in the topleft of the dev tools > scroll one tick down on the page > stop recording > screenshot
[17:21:23] <alexw> trying to find a decent form validator for JS
[17:21:38] <alexw> tried jquery.validate (outdated), parsley.js (half written)
[17:21:41] <alexw> Any recommendations?
[17:23:00] <nightcracker> BillCriswell: I had to record my screen and play back frame by frame, but yes that is broken as well
[17:24:20] <Hypnotizes> nightcracker: one tick down? I scrolled with mousepad http://puu.sh/8bGcL/ac478ac86f.png
[17:24:45] <nightcracker> yeah we need scrollwheel here
[17:24:49] <nightcracker> mousepad is too smooth
[17:25:31] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[17:26:23] <duch_kazatel> http://remysharp.com/2012/05/24/issues-with-position-fixed-scrolling-on-ios/
[17:26:28] <duch_kazatel> maybe some of these will work as well.
[17:29:35] <nightcracker> duch_kazatel: I don't see how this is relevant?
[17:29:48] <nightcracker> that article is talking about how to fix juttering of position: fixed on iphones
[17:29:57] <duch_kazatel> webkit.
[17:30:00] <duch_kazatel> might be related.
[17:30:02] <duch_kazatel> just a thought.
[17:30:47] <nightcracker> the problem isn't position: fixed itself
[17:31:00] <nightcracker> it's the transition of position: absolute -> position: fixed on the scroll event
[17:31:07] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:31:18] <duch_kazatel> and it only happens in one case but not another.
[17:31:26] <duch_kazatel> just tossing out ideas mang.
[17:31:58] <nightcracker> and the exact problem is that for one or a few frames AFTER the scroll event position: absolute still seems to be active while we clearly set position: fixed inside the scroll event handler
[17:33:33] <duch_kazatel> at a certain point, it's worth knowing what all might be to blame :)
[17:35:08] <duch_kazatel> also: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/scrolling/ - check out the section on debouncing.
[17:44:19] <nightcracker> ok
[17:44:24] <nightcracker> I found the weirdest fucking fix ever
[17:44:31] <duch_kazatel> what was it?>
[17:44:45] <__joshua__> i love debouncing.  all day i do it
[17:46:43] <snover> improve your code with this one weird fucking fix
[17:47:27] <nightcracker> http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/10/show/light/
[17:47:50] <duch_kazatel> still happens for me.
[17:47:58] <nightcracker> lol?
[17:48:03] <nightcracker> it doesn't for me now
[17:48:09] <nightcracker> dear god this bug is weird =/
[17:48:17] <duch_kazatel> much more subtle, but still there.
[17:48:49] <__joshua__> I had an awesome yesterday.  stemmed from the fact that I had assumed chromes Array.sort was stable.
[17:49:11] <duch_kazatel> well that's nice.
[17:50:16] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[17:52:15] <nightcracker> raah!!!!!!!
[17:52:21] <nightcracker> why doesn't my perfectly reasonable code work =/
[17:52:43] <nightcracker> and why does adding a seemingly pointless element fix the issue, yet not for someone else?
[17:53:45] <__joshua__> can you show us, nightcracker?
[17:54:18] <nightcracker> I made a little video showing the issue: http://gfycat.com/LimitedGoldenCaracal
[17:55:05] <__joshua__> the right menu scrolling issue?
[17:55:18] <nightcracker> gfycat has a frame-by-frame scroller
[17:55:21] <nightcracker> look at frame 33
[17:55:30] <nightcracker> and then look at the right menu, indeed
[17:55:43] <nightcracker> frame 63, sorry
[17:56:05] <Besan> guys, let me chalange you :) http://jsbin.com/rikuk/1/
[17:56:11] <Besan> Really need yourt help
[17:56:29] <__joshua__> hmmm, can't control frames
[17:56:56] <nightcracker> __joshua__: drag the green circle at the bottomright corner of the animation
[17:57:19] <BillCriswell> Besan: You're ajaxing wrong.
[17:57:30] <Besan> Tghe ajax part works great
[17:57:33] <nightcracker> around frames 62-65 you should see that for 1 frame everything is terrible
[17:57:44] <Besan> The problem is in the collapsible
[17:57:45] <__joshua__> nightcracker: ugh, that barely works.  by cursor covers the number, andthere is a lot of flashing
[17:58:14] <BillCriswell> Besan: If that's working you're lucky.
[17:58:15] <__joshua__> but i see the issue
[17:58:22] <Besan> BillCrisWell :)
[17:58:47] <__joshua__> why not just which to static position when they scroll past a certain point?
[17:59:08] <nightcracker> __joshua__ could you rephrase that?
[17:59:35] <Besan> BillCrisWell, can you make the collapsible not getting collapse every 5 secs ?
[17:59:41] <nightcracker> what the current code does is switch to position: fixed if the top of the menu gets too close to the browser edge
[17:59:49] <nightcracker> a minimal example is here: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/8/show/light/
[18:00:45] <Besan> I'm calling setTimeout() every 5 secs to update data, but it also collapse the <div>
[18:00:45] <__joshua__> right, thats what i meant, sorry.  can you reproduce the bug in the fiddle?
[18:00:50] <Besan> I need it to stay open
[18:01:02] <nightcracker> __joshua__ yes, the bug occurs in the fiddle I linked
[18:01:14] <tripflex> hey guys i'm trying to go through an xml document and find the first node with the attribute 'id' equal to a specific value
[18:01:23] <tripflex> do i need to use each after find...ex:
[18:01:24] <nightcracker> __joshua__: mysteriously only if I use the "direct" link I just sent you - if the page is in an iframe the bug does not occur
[18:01:29] <__joshua__> not for me, chrome 30
[18:01:37] <nightcracker> __joshua__: so far only people with google chrome on windows have managed to reproduce it
[18:01:44] <__joshua__> linux here
[18:01:45] <nightcracker> __joshua__: firefox and mac work fine
[18:01:51] <tripflex> $(xml).find('location[id="123"]').each(function(){ ....
[18:02:05] <__joshua__> i find (often too late) windows chrome quirks like this
[18:02:06] <BillCriswell> Besan: That's not going to be easy since you're rewriting the data completely
[18:02:20] <nightcracker> __joshua__: Ironically, this page works fine for me: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/10/show/light/
[18:02:25] <Besan> i know. . . .:( That's my problem
[18:02:31] <nightcracker> __joshua__: however that was still broken for someone else
[18:02:47] <Besan> I'm trying to find a way how to avoid rewriting
[18:04:39] <__joshua__> nightcracker: sounds strange, but try adding -webkit-transform: translateZ(0);
[18:04:58] <nightcracker> __joshua__: to the nav.sticky class?
[18:05:03] <__joshua__> yeah
[18:05:48] <BillCriswell> Besan: What do you plan on putting in the collapsable data?
[18:06:04] <Besan> Data from MySql
[18:06:05] <Besan> :)
[18:06:35] <BillCriswell> Will that need to update kinda live as well?
[18:06:51] <nightcracker> __joshua__ nothing :(
[18:06:55] <nightcracker> still bugged
[18:08:09] <__joshua__> so it is briefly losing the .sticky class or it is a rendering issue?
[18:08:10] <Besan> Generaly speaking, i need data to be updated without changing any of the UI state . . .
[18:08:55] <nightcracker> __joshua__ how could I see if it's briefly losing the .sticky car?
[18:08:58] <nightcracker> class*
[18:09:19] <__joshua__> a few ways.  firstly, use inspector
[18:09:26] <__joshua__> or poll for it in the console
[18:09:34] <nightcracker> __joshua__ remember, the .sticky class is only applied in the scroll event if we detect the window is scrolled too far down
[18:09:43] <Besan> BillCriswell , if you know any existing example of that, share it with me. I just need to see the logic  . . .
[18:09:44] <nightcracker> __joshua__ the .sticky class isn't always on nav
[18:10:35] <BillCriswell> nightcracker: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7FUqz/12/ anything different here?
[18:10:47] <__joshua__> right, but the bug occurs when are scrolled down already, so it should be there
[18:11:05] <nightcracker> BillCriswell: nope, still bounces
[18:11:10] <BillCriswell> Eh
[18:11:14] <nightcracker> __joshua__: no it doesn't
[18:11:31] <__joshua__> oh, guess im misinterpreting that gif
[18:11:32] <BillCriswell> nightcracker: Might just be worried over something you can't help.
[18:11:48] <nightcracker> __joshua__: the "bounce" occurs VERY briefly IMMEDIATELY AFTER scrolling down
[18:12:09] <nightcracker> __joshua__: it seems as if the scroll down happens and then only a few frames later the .sticky class gets applied
[18:12:16] <xunil__> Custom events using JQuery 1.*: Will they be always fired or only when some listeners are subscribed on (.on)?
[18:13:19] <__joshua__> I believe they will always bubble.  if a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it....
[18:13:50] <xunil__> __joshua__: wouldn't it be more efficient to only bubble when known listeners are there?
[18:13:57] <xunil__> __joshua__: or aren't event bubbles that costly?
[18:14:08] <__joshua__> ah, but how do you know unless you actually do the bubbling?
[18:14:48] <xunil__> right
[18:15:05] <xunil__> __joshua__: some elements invoke  .on('eventtype'  to listen
[18:15:13] <xunil__> __joshua__: couldn't this be used as an indicator?
[18:16:25] <BillCriswell> Besan: I think this would be best with some model view binding library.
[18:23:47] <__joshua__> but you don't know who the parents are until the event fires. then you have to traverse the parent of the element, seeing if each one has a listener for htat event.
[18:48:30] <Besan> http://jsbin.com/rikuk/1/
[18:49:23] <Besan> How to avoid collapsing every 5 secs /
[18:50:01] <Besan> People of FreeNode.net ! ! ! Need help !
[18:50:07] <Besan> :)
[18:53:07] <jphase> Besan: don't call loadPage every 5 seconds ?
[18:54:33] <jphase> you're rebuilding the entire div every 5 seconds, so they will naturally collapse
[19:06:35] <xunil__> For jquery custom events, can I use the selector parameter in on to filter for a class name?
[19:08:06] <shoky> xunil__ sure
[19:10:05] <xunil__> shoky: how? just use the classname instead of a selector?
[19:10:27] <shoky> what? use a class selector  '.myclass'
[19:12:02] <xunil__> ph
[19:12:04] <xunil__> oh
[19:12:06] <xunil__> right! :)
[19:12:36] <xunil__> shoky: another problem: I use on on a class which fires a custom event. Now in event context $this is not where the event is handled but the emitting class.
[19:12:45] <xunil__> I need $this for the place where .on is set
[19:13:07] <cronin> given the following, is there a one-liner that lets me check if the dictionary contains all strings ‚ÄúThis field is required.‚Äù http://jsfiddle.net/sg9LX/. For instance, i want to do something like: if string is not in dict, proceed.
[19:14:20] <shoky> xunil__ didn't fully understand the scenario but maybe you want event.target
[19:14:30] <shoky> xunil__  where event is the argument passed to the event handler
[19:16:12] <xunil__> shoky: In class A instance a custom event is triggered, in class B instance it is listened on class A instance:        classB { classA.on('custom-event', function(event) {  ... } ); }
[19:16:37] <xunil__> shoky: the problem is that $this in the on-closure would be class A instance and not class B instance.
[19:17:27] <shoky> really hard to understand you. did you try event.target?
[19:17:35] <shoky> make a jsfiddle if you need more help
[19:21:02] <the8thbit> I'm looking for an infinite ajax scroller with history, and I can't find one that's suitable. Any suggestions?
[19:21:05] <the8thbit> I tried this: http://infiniteajaxscroll.com/examples/overflow.html
[19:21:12] <the8thbit> but that demo doesn't work in Firefox
[19:21:18] <the8thbit> only Chrome
[19:25:09] <__joshua__> heh, thats retarded.
[19:26:50] <nightcracker> ok guys
[19:26:57] <nightcracker> I just opened a chromium bug about this... https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=364348
[19:27:18] <nightcracker> I can't really see a sensible way how I should change my code to make it work, and it seems to be a chrome-only Windows-only issue
[19:27:28] <__joshua__> easy to make your own though.  listen for scroll events on the overflowed element. when innerHeight < scrollHeight append more
[19:32:12] <the8thbit> __joshua__: Hm, I suppose I could do that. With so many endless scroll APIs I assumed it wouldn't be so trivial to do well...
[19:32:18] <the8thbit> but maybe that's why theres so many!
[19:33:19] <xunil__> shoky: ok, I made a fiddle example: http://jsfiddle.net/QT7xE/3/
[19:33:44] <xunil__> shoky: so this in event handler closure is not the listening class instance but the emitting class instance.
[19:34:01] <xunil__> shoky: I also tried target but it is the emitting class instance, too.
[19:35:30] <shoky> xunil__ huh what is this :\
[19:35:37] <shoky> i thought you were talking about css classess
[19:36:02] <__joshua__> the8thbit: https://github.com/joshgagnon/scroll_hint/blob/master/scroll_hint.js is a $ plugin for adding hints to scrolling stuff. you could use the comparisons to test for scroll limit
[19:36:25] <xunil__> shoky: oh
[19:36:39] <xunil__> shoky: no, in this case it is a custom event and class, but jquery is used.
[19:37:58] <shoky> xunil__ uhh maybe you want this.. http://jsfiddle.net/QT7xE/4/
[19:39:25] <xunil__> shoky: ah, you use self, right?
[19:40:05] <xunil__> shoky: thanks, this works
[19:40:07] <shoky> yuh. the name doesn't matter
[19:40:18] <xunil__> shoky: is this good practice to do this that way?
[19:40:25] <xunil__> shoky: Or does this indicate a flaw in my code?
[19:40:43] <shoky> i have no idea what you're trying to do. it seems pretty flawed though ;P
[19:41:10] <shoky> but the "var self = this" thing is not flawed in itself, it's common to do that
[19:41:57] <xunil__> ok thanks :)
[19:42:01] <xunil__> shoky: it was just an example :)
[19:42:08] <xunil__> shoky: I just want to pass a custom event to another class
[19:42:25] <shoky> js doesn't have classes
[19:42:33] <shoky> only objects
[19:44:57] <xunil__> shoky: I am still new to js :)
[19:45:10] <xunil__> shoky: I have to get used to this
[19:50:32] <xunil__> shoky: Can I call a javascript function in a way that it uses another this as it normally would?
[20:02:40] <shoky> xunil__: yes, using .call or .apply  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[20:03:05] <xunil__> shoky: thank you!

[22:01:48] <GoSox> if i'm using the .change() event handler on a <select>, how do I see what specific <option> has been selected? $(this) is still referring to the <select> itself, right?

[22:17:58] <Besan> How to avoid collapsing every 5 secs /
[22:18:01] <Besan> ?
[22:24:19] <Besan> Wake up people ! ! ! nobody wants to save a soul tonight ? :)
[22:25:33] <Besan> Jesus, seems that only noobs like me are online at this time :)
[22:26:23] <Uhkis> Besan: calm down
[22:26:34] <Besan> :) i am Uhkis
[22:27:12] <Besan> Just skiding around . . .
[22:27:16] <Besan> ;P)
[22:27:17] <Besan> ;)
[22:27:19] <BigBangUDR> Hello @all
[22:27:24] <Besan> Hello
[22:27:37] <Besan> Uhkis, are you good with JQM ?
[22:28:58] <Uhkis> never tried it
[22:29:18] <Uhkis> could you move that demo to jsfiddle?
[22:29:48] <Besan> Yes, but jsfiddle has some issues with simulating ajax/json . . .
[22:30:11] <Besan> let me check
[22:31:48] <Besan> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/besanu/6zkna/
[22:32:08] <Besan> globalVar is the ajax simulation
[22:32:25] <Besan> This is the best a can do with jsfiddle
[22:32:29] <Uhkis> well that demo doesn't autocollapse
[22:32:42] <Besan> 1 sec
[22:36:56] <Besan> Uhkis, as i said: jsfiddle gives me hard time when it comes to ajax simulation . . . :(
[22:37:20] <Besan> jsbin works perfect . . .
[22:38:08] <Uhkis> except a) it's not editable
[22:38:41] <Besan> Uhkis, you know the solution ?
[22:38:42] <Besan> ?  ? ?
[22:38:58] <Besan> let me try once again
[22:39:25] <Uhkis> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[22:42:16] <Besan> Uhkis, i tried to create a jsfiddle using your link but i gave up :)
[22:53:26] <technosexual> so with jwt... are you supposed to have the client send credentials, and then you send the client a token to store?
[22:53:33] <technosexual> or hang on to or whatever.
[22:54:17] <technosexual> and then the client sends the token + credentials with each request?
[22:54:52] <technosexual> and then you store the token for the session on the server?
[22:56:29] <gavrochel> hello
[22:56:46] <Besan> Hello
[22:58:13] <technosexual> I think that's how this whole JWT thing works.
[22:59:34] <gavrochel> I have a ajax call with a very small response (it returns 1 or 2) but tha page takes about 1 second to display the result
[23:00:27] <gavrochel> chrome devtools says: Initiator: jquery-1.11.0.min.js:4 Time 1.03 s
[23:00:43] <gavrochel> Is this normal?
[23:00:59] <technosexual> Yep, looks like I was right.
[23:03:39] <Besan> Uhkis, look at this jsfiddle, maybe you'll be able to setup the ajax request :) http://jsfiddle.net/besanu/6zkna/
