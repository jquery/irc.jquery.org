[00:00:10] <Cork> cause what you get isn't a string so might be your sending it something your not expecting
[00:00:13] <ENQ> can i check if its off?
[00:00:50] <Cork> ENQ: thats normally triggered by a timer so not really
[00:00:55] <coldhead> Committed revision 168600.
[00:01:02] <ENQ> i see
[00:05:50] <rhino__> Cork: tnx, just like you suggested and I thought, all I needed to do was to cast it to a string
[00:05:53] <rhino__> tnx

[00:07:47] <Atty> say i have a table with user data. And I want to put a modal form to edit eash users data. How do I pass the userid from the row to the modal?
[00:07:56] <Atty> Im using simplemodal
[00:10:01] <coldhead> that might be too advanced for simple modal
[00:12:24] <blackspotwiggins> lo coldhead
[00:13:03] <coldhead> guten tag
[00:13:23] <blackspotwiggins> how is it going in the land down under?
[00:14:00] <coldhead> can't complain or if you do no one listens so you might as well not bother
[00:14:34] <blackspotwiggins> hah :)
[00:15:49] <coldhead> having a bit of a nosebleed
[00:15:59] <coldhead> which is probably the highlight of my day, actually

[00:26:09] <peiper> hey, i got a strange problem with ajax :( success-function gives back [{"id":32,"name":"dffddd","description":"dfdfdfd","adminrole":70}] but xy.id is undefined?!
[00:26:27] <Cork> xy[0].id
[00:26:36] <Cork> you have an object in an array
[00:26:45] <Cork> (the [])
[00:26:55] <peiper> ahhh! thanks :P
[00:28:54] <bigLanky> anyone know of an easy to use and config jquery script that works similar to a coverflow script? basically i have 5 links that i will need to rotate left and right. each <li> will contain a link, and description text... first the order is 1-2-3-4-5.. when you click next i need it to change the positioning to 2-3-4-5-1 and so on
[00:29:44] <Cork> bigLanky: you don't really need a script to do that
[00:29:58] <Cork> just do parent.append(parent.children().first())
[00:31:55] <bigLanky> i dnot think i get what you mean
[00:31:57] <bigLanky> do you have an example?
[00:36:30] <Cork> bigLanky: parent is the element thats your container
[00:36:53] <Cork> when you want to switch to the order of the links just do parent.append(parent.children().first())
[00:37:00] <bigLanky> ah ok
[00:37:01] <Cork> and no i don't have an example
[00:37:26] <peiper> Cork is there a way to do a file upload with progress without flash/php addons ?
[00:37:36] <Cork> no
[00:37:55] <Cork> the server has to provide information about how much is received
[00:38:24] <Cork> but ya, its doable without flash
[00:38:33] <Cork> ?mdc fileapi
[00:38:36] <peiper> but with php addons i guess?
[00:38:58] <flam_> websockets?
[00:39:14] <Cork> uh... why use websocket?!?
[00:39:37] <coldhead> if we had time machines we could send a message from the future advising how long the upload took and the browser could display it as it happens
[00:39:41] <coldhead> but nooo
[00:40:23] <Cork> peiper: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/File
[00:40:23] <blackspotwiggins> xhr2 api has progress events
[00:40:31] <blackspotwiggins> it works on nice browsers
[00:41:14] <blackspotwiggins> there is an issue with firefox, it does not trigger complete before the server sends the first byte back
[00:42:59] <peiper> xhr2 hmm
[00:43:02] <peiper> ill take a look at ti
[01:01:33] <Christer> Hi all, anyone got any experience with fixed positions on iPad? I got one image, and i need to make like clickable points on the image. i.e clicking on an "object". and it has to work for both the iPad and IE8
[01:41:42] <Simoncowell> Morning all.. I'm using jScrollPane and I need to use a dragger(the part of the scroller you click hold and drag) that stays at a certain height no matter the content. The dragger height is currently programmatically  adjusted depending on the amount of content Is, same as OS drag bars.  Is there a way in the api to set a fixed height?
[01:42:51] <Cork> Simoncowell: no
[01:42:58] <Cork> you would have to build your own
[01:43:12] <Cork> there is js libs to do that
[01:43:46] <Simoncowell> Cork, I was afraid of that.. Would you know the names of those libraries?
[01:44:56] <Cork> http://www.hesido.com/web.php?page=customscrollbar
[01:45:02] <Cork> http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/jScrollPane/jScrollPane.html
[01:45:07] <Cork> just to grab a few
[01:45:34] <Cork> the first one has been around for ages
[01:46:40] <Simoncowell> I'll try the first, thanks. Your second suggestion is the one i'm using currently ;)
[01:48:30] <Cork> Simoncowell: that lib might actually be able to give you same size handles
[01:48:38] <Cork> never fiddled with it so donno
[01:49:47] <Simoncowell> Cork, hmm I guess I should look over the api one more time. Thanks again :)
[01:50:05] <Cork> Simoncowell: and if it does't you can always extend it :)
[02:01:47] <Mech0zWork> anyone know a jquery plugin I can use to create a table that is "locks" both the left and top so if I scroll they dont move like this http://www.gratisimage.dk/image-203A_50222ABC.jpg or a scrollbar for vertical and pages for horizontal?
[02:02:35] <Cork> Mech0zWork: you mean that the headers doesn't scroll?
[02:02:47] <Cork> or that the entire table doesn't scroll?
[02:04:37] <Mech0zWork> Cork the left column and the top header contain data that should always be visible
[02:05:08] <Mech0zWork> so if you see a checkbox you can accually see what that checkbox means
[02:05:28] <Mech0zWork> without having to scroll up or sideways to see what it does
[02:09:55] <websingh> hello all.
[02:10:07] <niels__> How can i do this differently? It works in Chrome, but Explorer doesn't work, at all. People shouldn't be able to type anything in the field. http://pastebin.com/yfQgqrYe
[02:10:17] <Cork> Mech0zWork: so you want a plugin that let you float headers
[02:10:54] <Cork> niels__: <input readonly="readonly">
[02:11:18] <niels__> Cork: which means i could do .attr('readonly', 'readonly'); ?
[02:11:35] <Cork> yes, let me just check so you i give you the correct attribute
[02:11:45] <anew_> shoky is in here ?
[02:11:52] <niels__> thank you Cork
[02:12:03] <Cork> niels__: yup readonly
[02:12:18] <Cork> alternatively you can do .prop('readOnly', true)
[02:38:58] <indy_> hello everybody. If I drop a file from my desktop in a div box, how can I retreive ONLY its path/filename?
[02:42:57] <Cubix> indy_: you might be able to extract something from the event object on mouseup?
[02:43:06] <xec> indy_: i was curious so i googled and found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3025841/javascript-file-drop
[02:44:20] <Cork> indy_: you won't be able to retreave the path, but the filename should be possible
[02:45:41] <indy_> basically what I have to do is to drop an astronomical FITS file, check if it is a valid FITS file and display the header on another div
[02:46:52] <indy_> an idea would be to drop the file in an input box, erase the "file://" part and then do what you Cubix said
[02:46:57] <|TheWolf|> hi
[02:46:59] <|TheWolf|> any idea why http://pastebin.com/aB0J8C4i does not work? console output is undefined twice (first time is ok, second time isn't) and #all does not become opaque
[02:50:12] <Cork> |TheWolf|: is your code wrapped in dom ready?
[02:50:33] <|TheWolf|> Cork : it's included in the header of an html page
[02:50:39] <Cork> so no
[02:50:51] <|TheWolf|> yeah
[02:50:55] <Cork> add $(function() { /* your code */ });
[02:51:47] <|TheWolf|> Cork : to the variable declarations in the beginning or to all the code?
[02:52:26] <Cork> |TheWolf|: depends on how you want to do it, but the selectors has to run in it
[02:52:33] <Cork> in this case the $('#all')
[02:52:44] <keirlav87> is there a way to turn window.location.search into an object reliably - something like index.php?hello=world would become {'hello' : 'world'} ?
[02:52:47] <Cork> cause the #all element doesn't exist when your selector runs
[02:53:46] <Cork> keirlav87: decodeURIComponent
[02:53:54] <keirlav87> thank you :)
[02:54:07] <Cork> and split('=')
[02:56:46] <indy_> what I don't understand is: why if a I drop the file in a input box I can have  a path, and if I drop it in a div I can't?
[02:57:00] * websingh slaps indy_ around a bit with a large trout
[02:57:26] <indy_> websingh: I did not understand
[02:57:47] <|TheWolf|> Cork : so the variable declarations would be enough?
[02:57:55] <|TheWolf|> Cork : thanks, I'll try that
[03:17:48] <Elephphant> Is there a non invite JS room on this server ?  I tried to join  #javascript but its invite on;ly :/
[03:17:52] <Elephphant> Is there a non invite JS room on this server ?  I tried to join  #javascript but its invite only :/
[03:18:14] <Elephphant> Note to self, this isn't skype - Arrow up does not edit.
[03:19:15] <xec> Elephphant: ##javascript is not invite only (but maybe you need to register your nick?)
[03:20:25] <Elephphant> its arguable it involved jQuery as its the result of a $.grep
[03:20:32] <Elephphant> ill register nick
[03:21:51] <xec> Elephphant: feel free to post your question in any case
[03:26:55] <Elephphant> Issue with object returning but parameters unable to be accessed - http://pastebin.com/9hTmUNZL
[03:27:32] <Elephphant> ignore the trailing commer in the array, i put the array on a diet.
[03:28:10] <xec> speaking of arrays - it's what's returned
[03:28:18] <Elephphant> is it ?
[03:28:25] <xec> so maybe GetSubjectGradesObjectById(9)[0].LevelsAndPoints
[03:28:55] <xec> yes, $.grep() returns an array
[03:28:59] <Elephphant> Yeh that works
[03:29:06] <Elephphant> why did .first() not work then ?
[03:29:28] <xec> because .first() is a jquery method, not an array method
[03:29:39] <Elephphant> Fair enoguh
[03:36:33] <juria_roberts> this is my html <p id="label">Hello<span>World</span></p>.How do I change the text inside id=label and not the text inside span?
[03:36:35] <xec> just curious, how do you pronounce your nick, is it "ele-pee-eigh-pee-hant" or "el-eff-ant" or"elef-f-ant"?
[03:36:36] <xec> :D
[03:38:37] <xec> juria_roberts: it would be easier if you had a seperate element for what you want to change
[03:39:22] <juria_roberts> xec:thats not an option i cant change the HTML
[03:39:49] <xec> okay, then maybe use native js to access the text node
[03:41:25] <juria_roberts> xec:how do i get text through javascript?
[03:42:48] <xec> juria_roberts: http://jsfiddle.net/BJ8CA/
[03:44:20] <juria_roberts> xec:haha is that supposed to be the opposite of Hello World :p
[03:44:53] <xec> juria_roberts: indeed ;) -- mind you, that snippet assumes blindly that the first child of #label is going to be the text node
[03:45:37] <juria_roberts> xec:hehe that made me laugh...yeah the first child will always be text so thats perfect for me thanks
[03:58:47] <durre> anyone using the bootstrap typeahead util? I have json data like this [{'name': 'first name'}, {'name': 'second name'}]… how do I get it to match on the element name?
[04:02:34] <LordThumper> Hi
[04:02:53] <LordThumper> $(document).on("click", ".foo", function () { })
[04:03:07] <LordThumper> How do I access .foo in the anonymous function? this or event.target?
[04:03:31] <LordThumper> When the event handler is run i mean
[04:07:20] <juha_> LordThumper: this and if you want to use jquery methos, $(this)
[04:07:54] <LordThumper> juha_: I was using event.target, but that doesn't work in firefox
[04:07:56] <LordThumper> thanks
[04:09:03] <juha_> LordThumper: it works also
[04:09:10] <juha_> LordThumper: you need to pass event to the function
[04:09:18] <xec> LordThumper: you haven't defined "event" in that snippet - also, event.target will be whatever you clicked (which could be an ancestor element)
[04:09:29] <juha_> LordThumper: $(document).on("click", ".foo", function (event) { $(event.target) })
[04:10:01] <juha_> LordThumper: xec is right, if you want to use target, currentTarget is a better choice (as far as i know)
[04:10:18] <LordThumper> I see,
[04:10:39] <LordThumper> yes my problem was i need to define event as a parameter in the anonymous function
[04:10:43] <LordThumper> in firefox, didn't know that
[04:12:07] <anew> anyone use require.js ?
[04:13:09] <xec> LordThumper: also, check out http://jsfiddle.net/99JER/
[04:14:05] <xec> LordThumper: if you got your console open you can see the difference when you click
[04:14:38] <LordThumper> As i need .foo, I should use this right?
[04:14:48] <xec> yes
[04:15:00] <LordThumper> I see thanks alot
[04:15:11] <LordThumper> Btw, why does Chrome not require event to be passed as a parameter?
[04:15:43] <xec> i thought it did, but apparently it's adopted IE's convention of having a global event object
[04:15:56] <LordThumper> ah its a global object
[04:16:10] <LordThumper> is the value lost when the function returns?
[04:17:40] <LordThumper> anyways thanks everyone
[04:26:12] <Dirkos> How can i add an object as onclick reference. Like $('#save-modal a.yes').attr('onclick', "saveSelection(event, $("+oRow+"));");
[04:31:06] <granden> "$("p").live("click", function(){});" are those supposed to be written like, $(document).on("click", "p", function(){}); now in 1.7?
[04:31:15] <quicksilver> granden: yes.
[04:31:17] <Cork> yes
[04:31:24] <quicksilver> or a more specific selector than document if you can
[04:31:38] <quicksilver> (if you know your <p>s will only be added in a particular div, or whatever)
[04:32:37] <granden> quicksilver: Ok
[04:32:56] <granden> And that one will be place outside my $(document).ready or inside?
[04:33:17] <Cork> inside
[04:33:31] <Cork> everything that binds to the dom should always be inside
[04:34:21] <granden> ok
[04:34:34] <quicksilver> Cork: not sure it matters if you bind to document actually? the document object is always there to attach handlers too.
[04:34:41] <quicksilver> but inside would be best practice and you might change it later
[04:35:06] <granden> And as I know all the p's will be inside <div id="par"></div> so then $('#par').on(... would be correct way?
[04:35:11] <granden> Cool. Thanks guys
[04:36:08] <quicksilver> granden: yes.
[04:41:36] <granden> hmm, no link that I do .click() on does work in ie
[04:41:43] <granden> oh, not links, divs.
[04:42:06] <granden> I want clickable Divs, currently empty but does that mather? As I specified a fixed with and height on them?
[04:42:24] <seutje> shouldn't matter
[04:43:29] <granden> Strange, they does not work in IE9 and opera, dont really care about opera but need em to work in ie 8 and 9 at least.
[04:44:30] <granden> http://a45.se/retursacken/indexie.html
[04:44:42] <granden> Try press inside that blue div. Works great in all webkit and mozilla browsers.
[04:44:45] <granden> But not ie.
[04:45:11] <granden> Hmm, works in opera apperently.
[04:45:45] <mazzachre> Would I be correct in assuming that $(document).ajaxComplete(function(event, xhr, opts) {alert('Moo');}); Would alert a "Moo" every time any ajax function ever completes on my page?
[04:47:43] <Cork> mazzachre: why are you using delegated event from the parent id?
[04:47:51] <Cork> seams kinda pointless
[04:50:52] <xec> mazzachre: yes. the docs are pretty clear on this. it doesnt matter what element you bind to, as ajax doesn't really have anything to do with the DOM.
[04:51:39] <Cork> quicksilver: it does actually
[04:52:06] <quicksilver> Cork: how come?
[04:52:53] <Cork> quicksilver: cause of a few reasons, if your remove the section that relates to the "live" event, you have to remember to remove the listener cause its doesn't remove it self
[04:53:18] <Cork> quicksilver: so its just that the code becomes less contained
[04:53:33] <Cork> its the same as storing everything you so in global variables
[04:53:35] * quicksilver nods
[04:54:04] <Cork> you want variables to get limited to the current scope, same with events
[04:55:46] <granden> seams like no jquery at all can be run in IE on my site.
[04:55:58] <granden> I added a console.log($('#div1'))
[04:56:02] <granden> and noting gets printed.
[04:56:09] <granden> Where shoul I start search for errors.
[04:56:30] <seutje> if there's no jQuery, that would error out with like "undefined is not a funciton"
[04:56:32] <quicksilver> console.log doesn't work on IE.
[04:56:35] <seutje> but without typos
[04:56:40] <seutje> sure it does
[04:56:44] <seutje> just not in IE<8
[04:57:03] <seutje> ?fixingthesejqueries
[04:57:14] <seutje> fixingthesejquery.com
[04:57:18] <xec> if the console isn't open IE will just stop processing
[04:57:29] <quicksilver> seutje: in IE8 isn't only there if you have developer tool installed
[04:57:33] <quicksilver> don't know about newer versions.
[04:57:40] <quicksilver> s/isn't/it's/
[04:57:55] <seutje> IE8 comes with a dev toolbar, but like xec said, has to be open
[04:58:01] <seutje> or it won't even give you an error
[04:58:29] <seutje> just slap some jash on it or something
[04:59:17] <xec> hehe, from wikipedia: Jash (Kurdish: Caş or Cahş, literally meaning "donkey's foal")
[04:59:26] <mazzachre> xec: I didn't find the documentation clear... But thanks... I just want a handler to run every time I have finished any ajax call on the page...
[04:59:39] <seutje> http://www.billyreisinger.com/jash/
[05:00:04] <Cork> quicksilver: i'm quite sure ie8+ has console.log
[05:00:22] <quicksilver> apparently it does, if you have the developer tools window open.
[05:00:27] <Cork> quicksilver: its definitely true for ie7 though
[05:00:34] <Cork> yup
[05:00:35] <xec> mazzachre: First lines from http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/ :: Whenever an Ajax request completes, jQuery triggers the ajaxComplete event. Any and all handlers that have been registered with the .ajaxComplete() method are executed at this time.
[05:00:55] <granden> Anyone? A normal .click why does it not work. I even tried using .on and still not working.
[05:00:58] <granden> No errors in the console.
[05:02:11] <quicksilver> granden: you had lots of answers and you ignored them all
[05:02:14] <seutje> granden: are you matching any elements?
[05:02:25] <granden> quicksilver: Did not see it. Sorry then.
[05:02:30] <quicksilver> it's hard to have a converstaion and help you if you don't respond to the things people say :)
[05:02:42] <granden> quicksilver: Did not notice it. Sorry!
[05:02:50] <seutje> granden: might be interesting to look at that fixingthesejqueries presentation by the lovely ajpiano
[05:02:54] <quicksilver> do you have the developer tools window open? does console.log work in general?
[05:03:23] <granden> have the developer tools open
[05:03:25] <granden> yes
[05:03:49] <granden> console.log have worked before. But I could ignore that as well. I just want my .click() to work. and, .on once.
[05:04:08] <granden> seutje: Will look at it.
[05:04:15] <granden> Sorry for not being more alert.
[05:06:23] <granden> Ok, no error at all in the console.
[05:08:23] <hopsy> exit
[05:09:24] <Ring0``> Hi. Can anyone explain me what actually triggers the class change? `aaa` will do the trick but where in ezmark function I see that CLICK should trigger this change?! http://jsfiddle.net/6vNLA/1/
[05:09:42] <granden> quicksilver and seutje dunno where to go from here as it is not working
[05:10:37] <quicksilver> granden: you need to explain more of your problem and, probably, make a jsfiddle of it.
[05:10:52] <quicksilver> What doesn't work? Does it work in other brosers just not in IE? Have you had *anything* working in IE?
[05:11:02] <granden> No nothing works in ie
[05:11:18] <granden> the starts page got a jquery link, to hide one div and show another
[05:11:21] <granden> that is not working.
[05:11:34] <granden> http://a45.se/retursacken/indexie.html - Thats the site I try to debug.
[05:12:16] <seutje> Ring0``: wait what? you want to know what triggers it?
[05:12:24] <seutje> Ring0``: onchange, it seems
[05:13:29] <Ring0``> seutje: well if you click on the box or 'aaa', the class will change, but I can't see in javascript line where is condition to do that
[05:14:06] <Ring0``> There should be some .onchange() or if() or whtever?
[05:14:20] <seutje> Ring0``: $this.addClass(defaultOpt.hideCls).wrap(wrapTag).change(function() {
[05:14:35] <Ring0``> *dang*
[05:15:10] <anew> anyone use require.js here ?
[05:15:27] <seutje> Ring0``: it's a bit of a weird construct though, not very easy to read/follow
[05:15:38] <quicksilver> granden: well, that console.log will crash IE if you don't have a developer tools window open
[05:15:40] <Ring0``> seutje: yeah, ready sollution.
[05:15:49] <keirlav87> how do i remove all empty keys from an object?
[05:15:51] <granden> quicksilver: Removed it.
[05:16:24] <quicksilver> apart from that I don't immediately see anything wrong
[05:16:31] <quicksilver> I don't have IE so I can't test it in IE
[05:16:43] <quicksilver> the IE developer console should at least give you a JS error if there is one
[05:17:36] <Ring0``> sunbeam: hmm am I able to trigger it using aaa`s onclick without using trigger('click') but trigger('change') or similair?
[05:17:53] <Ring0``> seutje: * ;)
[05:18:07] <seutje> Ring0``: no, click on aaa triggers change on the checkbox/radio button
[05:18:17] <Ring0``> I see. Thanks a lot seutje
[05:18:24] <seutje> triggering change on aaa won't do anything afaict
[05:18:38] <granden> quicksilver: What browsers do you got? Got Opera? I think there is a asimilar problem in opera acctually.
[05:20:02] <granden> but its on the second page, when you have added one item, and then clicks ta bort (remove)
[05:21:25] <MindSpark> hi, does anyone know if I can combine several selectors into one? I.e. I have a grandparent a parent and a few children. I want to select specific children using nth-child. Is it possible to select these by typing the grandparent and parent only once?
[05:21:59] <Cork> granden: your page is in quirks mode, and thats a REALLY bad idea
[05:22:07] <MindSpark> something  like #gp #p :nth=child(2,5,7)
[05:22:26] <Cork> you should run your page through w3c validation and after all the errors are fixed see if you can reproduce the problems
[05:22:32] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fa45.se%2Fretursacken%2Findexie.html&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[05:22:38] <Cork> 56 Errors, 5 warning(s)
[05:22:46] <granden> Cork: Ok, what does it mean it is quirks mode?
[05:22:54] <Cork> and words of all is  Line 1, Column 1: no document type declaration; implying "<!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM>"
[05:22:58] <shoshy> hi, i'm dragging a div (using jquery UI draggable) where the draggable objec is a button. That button can also be clicked. When i drag , most of the times, the button (at the end of the drag) acts as if it was clicked. How can i cancel this behavior when dragging? i tried adding $('#some_button').click(false); to stop event of draggable.
[05:23:26] <Cork> granden: it means that browsers will try to emulate 1992 versions of browsers
[05:23:34] <granden> haha, damn :)
[05:24:23] <granden> hmm, but that validator is not really correct either. It says I got a </td> without ever opening one.
[05:24:29] <granden> But I clearly opens one on the line before.
[05:24:42] <Cork> granden: fix the doctype and the errors should be better
[05:24:55] <Cork> its validating it as quirkmode right now
[05:25:10] <Cork> granden: add <!doctype html> at the top
[05:25:13] <granden> ok
[05:25:26] <Cork> and things should imporve quite a bit from just that
[05:27:41] <granden> Cork: Yes it did, but still not working teh buttons.
[05:27:50] <granden> And my background gets really missplaced :)
[05:28:15] <bailus> i try to run all my pages in quirks mode
[05:28:25] <bailus> it makes ie6 super fast
[05:28:47] <subhojit777> I am creating an element using appendTo() method, the element is created just after a textbox. The textbox is now positioned using css float, width, etc., but the element is created where the position of textbox should be as per DOM. How can I create the element right after the textbox wherever it is positioned.
[05:29:21] <fn> hi - i've got a problem using jquery.cycle and fx: curtainX, i would like to turn the images (pos. absolute/right: 0) on the mid way - but it turns form the right side around
[05:32:56] <Cork> granden: <img id="bghand" src="behindhand.jpg" style="position:absolute;margin-left:60px;margin-top:110px;z-index:-150;"> is wrong too
[05:33:07] <Cork> opps wrong tag
[05:33:25] <granden> Why?
[05:33:27] <Graa> hello
[05:33:36] <Ring0``> one more thing seutje. How does it see if it's checked or not, I can't see anything changing in html code. There is the information about that stored?
[05:33:42] <Cork> granden: ignore that one :)
[05:33:54] <granden> :)
[05:33:59] <granden> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fa45.se%2Fretursacken%2Findexie.html&charset=iso-8859-1&doctype=Inline&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.3
[05:34:02] <granden> Did re run now.
[05:34:05] <granden> A few fixed thinks.
[05:34:51] <granden> things*
[05:37:11] <seutje> Ring0``: if $(this).is(':checked') or something
[05:37:22] <granden> Cork: Ok, fixed a few more problems.
[05:37:36] <Cork> granden: another thing, you shouldn't use negative z-indexes
[05:37:48] <Cork> -1 is an exception
[05:37:56] <Ring0``> seutje: yeah but when I trigger change, where is it stored. Usually in html code I should see checked="checked" in the checkbox
[05:38:20] <Graa> can i paste a pastebin here with a small jquery problem?
[05:38:38] <ezio> no
[05:38:41] <ezio> leave immediately
[05:38:42] <Graa> :(
[05:38:47] <ezio> of course
[05:38:47] * Graa cries
[05:38:57] <Graa> http://pastebin.com/fSpa5qR6
[05:39:09] <Guilherme> oaUHaoHUOAH
[05:39:10] <Cork> granden: could you try to remove the z-index: -100 from the image?
[05:39:22] <granden> ok, sure.
[05:39:33] <ezio> Graa, wrap the text you want to bold
[05:39:59] <ezio> in a <span id='my_bolding_string'>something</span>
[05:40:20] <ezio> $('#my_bolding_string').addClass('bold');
[05:40:46] <Graa> but how do i get the part from $("#"+partID) that is selected, and then perform some action on it?
[05:41:20] <ezio> $('#'+partId).addClass('bold');
[05:41:25] <ezio> do you have firebug
[05:41:37] <Graa> yes
[05:41:37] <granden> Cork: Removed
[05:41:49] <quicksilver> ezio: Graa is talking about the selected text I think
[05:41:50] <seutje> Ring0``: iono, it does check/uncheck though
[05:41:57] <ezio> ohhhh
[05:41:59] <granden> woops, must done something else wrong. Now teh whole site fucked.
[05:42:00] <granden> :)
[05:42:02] <seutje> Ring0``: u can see once u remove the 7 layers of turning it invisible
[05:42:10] <Graa> yeah :P
[05:42:10] <quicksilver> accessing the brwoser selection is a pain
[05:42:26] <Graa> dang i thought so
[05:42:26] <Ring0``> lol
[05:42:35] <Graa> i came across scripts to get the selected text from it
[05:42:37] <Cork> granden: try adding "zoom: 1;" to #order
[05:42:55] <ezio> Graa, http://mark.koli.ch/2009/09/use-javascript-and-jquery-to-get-user-selected-text.html
[05:43:14] <Ring0``> oh yeah seutje but still no sign of that in firebug html view O_O
[05:43:17] <Ring0``> wtf.
[05:43:17] <Graa> yes i can get the selected text
[05:43:22] <Cork> granden: btw any reason you can't bind the click on the img element?
[05:43:30] <ezio> then i would replace the html of parent with the parent's current contents substituting in the selected text with a span around it
[05:43:38] <Graa> hmm
[05:43:41] <granden> Cork: Not the complete element should be clickable to the same part
[05:43:45] <seutje> Ring0``: why does that matter?
[05:43:45] <quicksilver> but how would you find out which copy it was
[05:43:48] <Graa> that's an awesome idea
[05:43:48] <granden> only the part of the blue div.
[05:43:49] <Graa> thanks
[05:43:50] <Graa> :P
[05:43:52] <quicksilver> if the text was "bacon mushroom bacon"
[05:43:53] <Cork> granden: i think the effect your seeing is actually intended on ie, cause what your doing is clear element click, and thats seen as a bad thing
[05:43:56] <quicksilver> and the selected text is 'bacon'
[05:44:01] <ezio> Graa, np
[05:44:02] <quicksilver> how will you now which bacon was selected?
[05:44:12] <quicksilver> don't think ezio's link shows that.
[05:44:14] <Ring0``> seutje: I'm asking since when I will manually trigger $(this).attr('checked', false), this `code` will still think it's checked
[05:44:16] <fn> anybody work with cycle plugin?
[05:44:19] <Cork> granden: split the image up into parts?
[05:44:43] <seutje> Ring0``: heh, rly? o.O
[05:44:49] <ezio> quicksilver, there's always enough bacon to be selected
[05:44:50] <seutje> I hate form elements -_-
[05:44:58] <granden> I could try bind the click to the image for starters and see if that would solve the problem.
[05:45:00] <quicksilver> Graa: some more clues here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5351455/make-selected-text-bold-using-javascript
[05:45:16] <Ring0``> seutje: just a sec
[05:45:20] <quicksilver> http://code.google.com/p/rangy/ seems promising to me
[05:45:36] <granden> Cork: That did the trick.
[05:45:43] <ezio> lol rangy
[05:45:50] <Graa> ah great
[05:45:57] <Cork> granden: ok, so its the clear click that causes it
[05:46:15] <granden> Need to bind to the img. Will try to fix it then.
[05:46:28] <Cork> granden: you could use background-position and just render the same image but the part your interested in
[05:46:44] <anew> anyone use require.js ?
[05:47:07] <granden> Cork: I got a background as well.
[05:47:14] <granden> And IE does not support multiple backgrounds.
[05:47:15] <granden> :(
[05:47:42] <ezio> Graa, actually don't even think of using my idea ... i can see there being an issue when selecting across multple divs
[05:47:42] <Cork> granden: i meant for the #order element
[05:47:47] <ezio> or elemetns
[05:50:06] <ezio> my morning needs a dose of rumours
[05:50:14] <granden> Cork: Ah, but still then if having it as background the div would be empty?
[05:50:18] <granden> and not worknig as a link?
[05:50:24] <fn> anybody work with cycle plugin?
[05:51:00] <seutje> cycle is the shit!
[05:51:13] <fn> but the clients want it
[05:51:34] <seutje> "the shit" = good, just "shit" = bad
[05:51:40] <seutje> I know, english is funky
[05:51:44] <fn> ^^
[05:51:45] <ezio> yeah ... fn ... consult a dictionary
[05:51:54] <ezio> before you say stupid things again
[05:52:09] <seutje> ez there ezio
[05:52:16] <seutje> sorry, sounded funny in my head :P
[05:52:17] <ezio> loooooool
[05:52:22] <Ring0``> seutje: forget what I said, it took me 2 hours to find that chcecked is not same as checked
[05:52:24] <Ring0``> ._.
[05:52:37] <seutje> Ring0``: oh I know that feeling
[05:52:51] <seutje> Ring0``: a good IDE/editor can save a lotta time on things like that
[05:52:54] <ezio> it clearly wasn't stupid i was just being ironical
[05:53:21] <Ring0``> seutje: true that, I'm using notepad++, I used to work with DW but it hangs if file has > 10k lines of code so it sucks
[05:53:46] <ezio> Ring0``, pdt is good
[05:53:57] <Ring0``> ezio: I'll check it out
[05:54:04] <ezio> vs is awesome too
[05:54:10] <DelTree> DW surely sucks... but 10k lines in one file sucks too... ^_^
[05:54:41] <seutje> Ring0``: geany is a nice editor for windows, it's a really lightweight IDE
[05:54:42] <brettfrable> hey giuys
[05:54:51] <seutje> it'll flag variables it thinks you mistyped
[05:55:09] <Elephphant> Hi there
[05:55:10] <seutje> like if you defined a variable named woezelwazel and u try to use weozelwazel, it'll flag it
[05:55:24] <seutje> be all "yo, u maketh a typo perhaps?"
[05:55:26] <ezio> nothing is better than vs in my opinion
[05:55:27] <LordThumper> Does radio button only fire "changed" on selection and not on deselection?
[05:55:35] <LordThumper> Is that normal behaviour?
[05:55:36] <ezio> full intellisense even on jquery
[05:55:42] <Elephphant> I  have done a $(select option).remove() but stored the current value then populated the list with options (The previous list jsut contains the selected value - clearing it to restore order) . When I add attr("selected", "true") at end, the value is highligted but the value at the top of the select differs. Am I doing something wrong ?
[05:55:42] <ezio> it understands jquery
[05:55:49] <Elephphant> LordThumper :  Yes
[05:55:50] <seutje> LordThumper: I believe so, yea
[05:55:56] <seutje> ezio: vs?
[05:56:00] <ezio> jesus Elephphant
[05:56:11] <ezio> that's a long post .. you made what i was saying less important
[05:56:16] <Ring0``> seutje: aight! ;)
[05:56:20] <ezio> and everyone was hanging on every word
[05:56:20] <Elephphant> Sorry Ezio ;)
[05:56:30] <brettfrable> why is this continuing to slide in from the left and not  from the top? I've attached my js and css
[05:56:31] <brettfrable> http://pastebin.com/RHEjLJ0s
[05:56:45] <ezio> Elephphant, test case
[05:56:53] <ezio> probably something very simple
[05:57:01] <seutje> dirction: 'up'?
[05:57:10] <seutje> don't think it understands dirction
[05:57:13] <seutje> I sure don't
[05:57:26] <ezio> Elephphant, http://jsfiddle.net if you can't get out to the web
[05:57:33] <seutje> brettfrable: ^
[05:57:39] <brettfrable> than i'm not sure you understand query.effects.core.js
[05:57:53] <brettfrable> http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cgi-bin/practice.cgi?file=jquery_147
[05:58:11] <seutje> "direction", I understand
[05:58:14] <seutje> dirction, I don't
[05:58:34] <brettfrable> ohhhh
[05:58:35] <brettfrable> dude
[05:58:42] <brettfrable> there is an E in dirction
[05:58:45] <brettfrable> wtf
[05:58:50] <brettfrable> i need to go back to school
[05:58:54] <seutje> INORITE? who ever decided that?
[05:59:10] <brettfrable> still doesn't work
[05:59:14] <seutje> I'm using dirction from now on, it's shorter and funnier, obviously superior :P
[05:59:22] <ezio> people that speak diction neutral english know why
[06:00:11] <seutje> brettfrable: that closure at the top seems kinda useless
[06:00:26] <seutje> (function($){})(window.jQuery); <- there's nothing in there :(
[06:04:10] <ezio> some foke'll never lose a toe
[06:04:16] <ezio> but then again some foke'll
[06:06:04] <Cork> granden: no, empty == transparent
[06:06:11] <Cork> in this case
[06:06:19] <Cork> anyway /me afk
[06:06:59] <brettfrable> seutje now it just pops up
[06:07:02] <brettfrable> there is no animation
[06:07:18] <granden> Cork: Ok, cool. But I changed it to an transparent gif instead.
[06:07:26] <granden> then I could use the same gif where needed.
[06:07:34] <seutje> brettfrable: funky, I dunno dude, this is my first day using jQuery
[06:07:48] <granden> Not a good solution, I know I can see it myself. But it works. And in this case it is all it has to do.
[06:08:03] <granden> Will just be a short life website anyway.
[06:08:18] <Elephphant> ezio:http://jsfiddle.net/M2ZVT/3/ Not a working version but should give you the idea
[06:09:36] <mathi> hi
[06:10:05] <Elephphant> hi
[06:10:09] <mathi> I have a problem wrapping an applet element contaning "code" attribute
[06:10:18] <mathi> I filed a bug here: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12220
[06:10:28] <mathi> the problem is that I can't think of a workaround :(
[06:15:39] <ezio> wtf ... WHY CAN'T I DEBUG jsfiddles IN CHROME
[06:15:40] <ezio> RAAAAAAAAAGE
[06:15:49] <shoky> sure you can
[06:16:07] <slartsa> ezio what?
[06:16:14] <ezio> i'm getting no jquery in the console
[06:16:24] <shoky> because you're on the top window
[06:16:29] <shoky> not the result iframe
[06:16:49] <shoky> see <top frame> on the bottom?
[06:17:09] <ezio> shoky, thanks buds
[06:18:10] <ezio> Elephphant,  $('#test_select').val() = 2
[06:18:13] <ezio> ==2
[06:19:46] <brettfrable> shaky - you're pretty good at finding errors
[06:19:47] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/4411792
[06:19:51] <Elephphant> ezio, thats a negative
[06:20:03] <ezio> i can take a screenshot
[06:20:10] <brettfrable> what's going on? When I click the first item it doesn't slide in from the top - it just pops open
[06:20:21] <brettfrable> but when I close that one and click any of the other items in the gallery
[06:20:28] <brettfrable> it slides in from the top like it's suppose to
[06:20:32] <brettfrable> it's always the first one.
[06:20:38] <brettfrable> that isn't sliding in.
[06:20:49] <Elephphant> adding attr(selected) is getting closer as it higlight the right one
[06:21:06] <Elephphant> but value() = doesnt even do that
[06:21:23] <ezio> you mean val() right
[06:21:28] <brettfrable> ?
[06:21:37] <brettfrable> i mean shoky
[06:21:39] <brettfrable> sorry
[06:21:56] <ezio> brettfrable, no one's talking to you, you nitwit
[06:21:58] <ezio> :p
[06:22:32] <Elephphant> yhe
[06:22:42] <brettfrable> I addressed shoky
[06:22:47] <ezio> is that a yes?
[06:22:55] <brettfrable> I was talking to him - I didn't RESPOND
[06:22:57] <brettfrable> nitwit
[06:23:22] <ezio> and i was saying that message wasn't directed to you at all
[06:23:53] <brettfrable> i didn't respond to any message
[06:24:01] <brettfrable> so I have no idea what you're talking about

[06:24:16] <shoshy> who can help me with jquery ui and dragging a button (while preventing his click at the end of the drag) and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1771627/preventing-click-event-with-jquery-drag-and-drop doesnt work for me.. i've tried a lot of combinations and ways..
[06:24:22] <shoshy> please :)
[06:24:24] <ezio> lol okay
[06:24:42] <ezio> shoshy, preventdefault
[06:24:43] <brettfrable> lmao
[06:24:53] <shoshy> ezio: tried...
[06:25:06] <shoshy> i want the button to work
[06:25:21] <shoshy> but when is used as a handle for dragging, it won't
[06:25:22] <brettfrable> you need to place a click event on the button
[06:25:36] <shoshy> brettfrable: placed.
[06:26:20] <brettfrable> I'm doing something like that
[06:26:20] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/4411819
[06:26:24] <brettfrable> does it look like this
[06:26:28] <brettfrable> my buttons still work
[06:27:00] <shoshy> brettfrable: sec..
[06:27:46] <computer2000> anyone can recommend a simple, leightweight and sleek tooltip plugin'
[06:27:48] <computer2000> ?
[06:28:46] <ezio> qtip
[06:28:46] <shoshy> brettfrable: my code looks different, i'll pastebin it.. sec
[06:29:08] <shoshy> and it doesn't work like that (Even with the preventDefault of the click of the button)
[06:29:10] <ezio> computer2000, http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/
[06:29:37] <computer2000> ezio: isnt there qtip2 already?
[06:30:09] <ezio> looks like it
[06:30:10] <Elephphant> ezio, http://imgur.com/H36z3 - This is what's happening when I apply .attr("selected",ture)_
[06:30:10] <ezio> http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/
[06:30:18] <Elephphant> which is closest to what i need
[06:31:12] <shoshy> http://pastebin.com/u121FxJY
[06:31:31] <shoshy> where #results-toggle is a button
[06:31:37] <shoky> brettfrable: you have 2 click handlers being set _inside_ another click handler. is that your intention?
[06:32:12] <ezio> Elephphant, can you update your test case then?
[06:33:23] <ezio> Elephphant, the only way that you're gonna get help for this issue is if you can reproduce the issue
[06:35:28] <shoshy> brettfrable: any idea?
[06:36:26] <shoshy> ezio: maybe you have any idea.. ?
[06:37:51] <ezio> shoshy, what's your problem?
[06:38:14] <shoshy> http://pastebin.com/u121FxJY , trying to drag a button , and i keep getting his click event at the end
[06:38:27] <shoshy> (dragging a div using a button as an handler actually)
[06:38:36] <shoshy> and of course i want to use it as a button as well
[06:38:37] <ezio> do you have a test case?
[06:38:58] <shoshy> by that you mean? what's the need in such action ?
[06:39:34] <ezio> i mean jsfiddle buds
[06:39:53] <shoshy> i can put one..
[06:39:58] <shoshy> sec
[06:40:00] <ezio> this is horrible
[06:40:23] <ezio> you're missing syntax
[06:40:27] <Elephphant> ezio, http://jsfiddle.net/M2ZVT/13/ < - running same as my issue
[06:40:56] <ezio> works in chrome
[06:40:59] <ezio> what browser
[06:41:37] <ezio> or steps to reproduce
[06:41:46] <Teduardo> if a script is echo'ing NaN is there an error console or something you can use to see why that isn't working?
[06:41:56] <shoky> Elephphant: DDl.val() = TrySelect.val();
[06:41:58] <shoky> wrong^
[06:42:00] <ezio> a variable is likely null
[06:42:05] <ezio> Teduardo,
[06:42:14] <ezio> oh yes
[06:42:17] <ezio> very wrong
[06:43:05] <ezio> Elephphant, that'd be your issue
[06:43:15] <shoky> that's 2 mistakes in that line
[06:44:41] <shoshy> ezio: here http://jsfiddle.net/Ek5D2/
[06:44:55] <shoshy> drag it and see for your self
[06:46:20] <Teduardo> ezio: is there a way in firefox or whatever to see what variables it thinks are null?
[06:46:46] <Elephphant> ezio, I put that in under your suggestion :) Still heppens without it http://jsfiddle.net/M2ZVT/15/
[06:46:49] <niix> how to I send something as POST from a query object?
[06:46:58] <ezio> shoshy, on the start remove the handler for mouseup
[06:47:04] <ezio> on the stop set it again
[06:47:08] <ezio> and don't use click
[06:47:43] <ezio> Elephphant, debugging
[06:47:51] <shoshy> ezio: sec.. testing... :/
[06:48:32] <ezio> Teduardo, do you know how to debug?
[06:49:15] <shoshy> ezio: so what to use instead of click?
[06:49:23] <ezio> mouse up
[06:49:39] <jarco> I have an image that i set to display none with jquery. All browsers (tested: opera, ie, firefox) do it but chrome/midori do not. Does anyone see why not? http://mijnkmosite-s1.be/intern/50net/. The script is 50net.js
[06:50:29] <ezio> shoshy, and use .on('mouseup', function
[06:50:57] <shoshy> ezio: is this ok: http://jsfiddle.net/Ek5D2/2/ ? at the stop what to put? because the button won't work again, and re-setting it the function every time seems overkill (no?)
[06:52:37] <Teduardo> ezio: not really so much on the client side stuff.. much better with php, etc..
[06:52:38] <Elephphant> ezio, Ok
[06:53:29] <ezio> shoshy, use off instead of unbind and on instead of bind
[06:53:45] <ezio> Teduardo, youtube and don't come back until you know how to debug
[06:54:11] <shoshy> i just did, http://jsfiddle.net/Ek5D2/3/ still doesnt work after drag end
[06:54:35] <ezio> shoshy, k lemme just help elephant out he's been waiting
[06:54:40] <shoshy> np.
[06:54:44] <shoshy> thank you
[06:55:37] <ezio> Elephphant, line 234
[06:56:02] <jarco> In regard to my earlier problem I have found that chrome does not see the height of my image as 86 like all other browsers. It reports it as 0
[06:56:41] <Elephphant>  if (TrySelect == undefined) {
[06:56:41] <Elephphant>         } ?
[06:57:08] <Elephphant> ezio, there is nothing on 234 :)
[06:57:13] <ezio> tryselect oops sorry
[06:57:24] <ezio> wait
[06:58:00] <ezio> the execution looks okay .. i'm getting what i selected
[06:58:11] <ezio> i'm just supposed to drop the box down
[06:58:15] <ezio> and select something right?
[06:58:21] <Elephphant> just focus
[06:58:32] <Elephphant> it populates the list and should have it selected
[06:58:50] <ezio> it does that for me
[06:58:53] <Elephphant> it selects it (as in hylights) but not selected in the box (becomes 1A)
[06:59:05] <ezio> does that for me
[06:59:08] <Elephphant> so if you loose focus
[06:59:12] <Elephphant> it will be !A
[06:59:17] <Elephphant> 1A
[06:59:21] <Elephphant> rather then 4B+
[06:59:21] <ezio> negative
[06:59:33] <ezio> oh
[06:59:44] <ezio> you want the top to be the same as what they're hovering over?
[06:59:57] <Elephphant> yes, as its the current value
[07:00:13] <Elephphant> the select has a save on c hange so if it becomes 1A it will save wrongly
[07:00:26] <ezio> what browser
[07:00:28] <Elephphant> even though the 4b+ is "selected"
[07:00:35] <Elephphant> FF and chrome
[07:00:41] <Elephphant> IE7 support is required too
[07:00:48] <ezio> show me that imgur again
[07:01:11] <Elephphant> http://imgur.com/H36z3
[07:02:54] <ezio> Elephphant, i'm reloading the page
[07:02:57] <ezio> it says 4b+
[07:03:04] <ezio> i click the drop down
[07:03:11] <ezio> it says 4b+ at the top
[07:03:16] <ezio> and 4b+ at the bottom
[07:03:19] <Elephphant> browsr ?
[07:03:25] <Elephphant> and jfiddle link ?
[07:03:26] <ezio> chrom
[07:03:27] <ezio> e
[07:03:57] <Elephphant> not a chrome issue then
[07:03:57] <ezio> and your code looks good too
[07:03:59] <Elephphant> appologies.
[07:04:03] <ezio> http://jsfiddle.net/M2ZVT/15/
[07:04:04] <Elephphant> It doenst work in FF
[07:04:16] <ezio> ah
[07:04:17] <ezio> yes
[07:06:51] <jarco> Doezs anyone have any idea why chrome is reporting a different height for images then firefox/opera/ie? http://mijnkmosite-s1.be/intern/50net . The script is 50net.js
[07:07:34] <Kingsy> anyone having problems getting onto git hub? I am getting alot of 404's
[07:08:04] <shoshy> Kingsy: nope..
[07:08:31] <Kingsy> I cant seem to get the anythingZoomer from anywhere and the page for it on github is a 404
[07:08:54] <zarella> how do you select an element in the document with the class value of 'foo'
[07:09:03] <ezio> Elephphant, try this ... on the click, preventdefault/close the select, fill it, then open it again
[07:09:14] <zarella> $(document).$('.foo') gives an error: object has no method $
[07:09:29] <shoshy> Kingsy: it got 404
[07:09:40] <Kingsy> shoshy: yup... why?
[07:09:43] <seutje> Kingsy: maybe the repo was removed/privated
[07:09:50] <jarco> zarella, are you sure jquery is loaded?
[07:09:56] <ravenzz> ..
[07:09:58] <shoshy> Kingsy: i dunno, but https://github.com/Mottie/ works..
[07:10:04] <Elephphant> how do you mean prrevent default/close ?
[07:10:12] <Kingsy> oh I got it
[07:10:12] <ravenzz> zarella that make no sense infact, $('.foo')
[07:10:17] <ravenzz> is just fine
[07:10:23] <seutje> zarella: what are you trying, coz that syntax is just... well, wrong :x
[07:10:23] <ezio> zarella, you can't do that
[07:11:02] <ravenzz> otherwhise $(document).find('.foo');
[07:11:30] <ezio> Elephphant, add a click handler and preventdefault
[07:11:35] <ezio> and possibly
[07:11:37] <ezio> if you have to
[07:11:43] <ezio> close the select
[07:11:50] <ezio> then fill it
[07:11:55] <ezio> then set value
[07:11:58] <ezio> then open it again
[07:12:08] <Elephphant> its done on focus though
[07:12:12] <Elephphant> so it would be
[07:13:21] <ezio> yup .. not sure exactly how, but you need to fill the box between the click and the open
[07:13:24] <Elephphant> does event.preventDefault() only apply to clicks ?
[07:13:25] <ezio> it's a hack
[07:13:36] <ravenzz> Elephphant no
[07:13:37] <ezio> no it prevents events from ascending the chain
[07:14:03] <ezio> oh no
[07:14:05] <ezio> sorry
[07:14:05] <jarco> Does anyone have any idea why chrome is reporting a different height for images then firefox/opera/ie? http://mijnkmosite-s1.be/intern/50net . The script is 50net.js
[07:14:18] <ezio> that's stop propogation, but yes you want preventdefault
[07:14:44] <ravenzz> jarco provide a testcase, with the essential markup / javascript
[07:14:50] <ravenzz> pleese
[07:14:55] <ravenzz> -e+a
[07:15:26] <Elephphant> dont happen to have an eample ? not sure how to impliment
[07:15:55] <jarco> ravenzz, in the testcase it works but not in my site. Thats my question.
[07:16:48] <shoshy> ezio: you guys finished?
[07:17:07] <ezio> shoshy, two mins i'm gonna try something for him
[07:17:11] <shoshy> np..
[07:17:27] <Gho5t> users.sort(function(a, b){ return [a.name, a.role] > [b.name, b.role] ? 1:-1; });
[07:17:29] <Gho5t> is this a valid way to sort 2 values in an object
[07:17:34] <Gho5t> 	I found it online but I'm having trouble finding this in the spec
[07:17:36] <Elephphant>  sorry shoshy
[07:18:07] <shoshy> Elephphant: np .. :)
[07:22:53] <ezio> Elephphant, don't use onfocus in the select
[07:23:02] <ezio> use a jquery to target the focus
[07:23:10] <ezio> to bind the focus
[07:23:37] <ezio> $('select').focus(function(e){e.preventDefault();});
[07:24:02] <ezio> that might take you a bit
[07:24:10] <ezio> shoshy,
[07:24:44] <shoshy> yes
[07:24:50] <ezio> send me your updated fiddle
[07:25:07] <sear> Hey all.  I've written a function, getArtistsList, which makes makes an ajax call to my API.  It works fine under Safari and Chrome, but in Firefox, artists is undefined after the ajax call.  Can anyone point to what I might do differently?
[07:25:08] <sear> http://pastie.org/4412114
[07:25:29] <shoshy> http://jsfiddle.net/Ek5D2/4/
[07:26:07] <ezio> shoshy, ... the event isn't being rebound
[07:26:32] <ezio> you almost got it though
[07:26:56] <shoshy> ezio: so what should i do?
[07:27:08] <ezio> http://jsfiddle.net/ezio/Ek5D2/5/
[07:27:26] <shoshy> ahhh...
[07:27:31] <shoshy> i thought can can bypass that..
[07:27:32] <shoshy> :/
[07:27:35] <ezio> name that function
[07:27:55] <shoshy> with some sort of on('mouseup.special') and then off('mouseup.special') and on('mouseup.special')
[07:28:01] <shoshy> yea...
[07:28:34] <shoshy> ezio: thanks a lot for all your help :)
[07:28:39] <ezio> np
[07:29:37] <shoshy> bye guys... your great :)
[07:29:47] <ezio> facepalm
[07:30:45] <Elephphant> ezio,     focus(func(){  e.preventDefault(); DataLoadFunction(); new focusEvent() }) ?
[07:30:51] <Elephphant> ignore the sudo
[07:30:57] <jarco> I finally found it. Chrome was actually not ready (beats me why it is so slow with this but it seems to be a webkit specific problem) on document ready the images where not yet loaded in chrome so the height of them was indeed 0. Changing is to window load fixed the issue.
[07:31:30] <quicksilver> jarco: that's the point of document ready, yes.
[07:31:50] <quicksilver> the point of document ready is that it doesn't wait for resources, just the DOM.
[07:32:13] <quicksilver> of course if the resources load fast they may happen to be ready but they may not. If you want all resources, use load like you say.
[07:33:02] <ezio> Elephphant, i don't know if this is going to work, it's basically a hack .. but where's e?
[07:33:22] <Elephphant> sudo code
[07:33:38] <Elephphant> just trying to see if thats the logic your suggesting
[07:33:41] <ezio> even in your pseudo code
[07:33:42] <Elephphant> Cancel event
[07:33:44] <ezio> where's e
[07:33:55] <jarco> quicksilver, Then it seems like webkit is the only one doing it correctly
[07:34:04] <Elephphant> it will be passed in the func ()
[07:34:06] <quicksilver> jarco: not really, it's just not guaranteed.
[07:34:07] <jarco> all the others just returned the img height
[07:34:14] <Elephphant> ezio,     focus(func(e){  e.preventDefault(); DataLoadFunction(); new focusEvent() }) ?
[07:34:14] <sear> ezio: func(e)
[07:34:19] <Elephphant> ;)
[07:34:20] <sear> Would be more accurate
[07:34:28] <quicksilver> jarco: you were lucky (unlucky) and they had alread loaded the image by the time you asked for its height.
[07:34:29] <guitarguy> <sear> my first step would be to open up firebug, take a look at the response you received from the service, check out this link: http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/introduction-to-firebug-net-panel/
[07:34:29] <ezio> no
[07:34:49] <ezio> your focus function does not return e
[07:34:51] <jarco> quicksilver, I understand now. Thanks for explaining it. Learning new stuff every day :)
[07:35:22] <sear> guitarguy: I actually did that, and I am getting the appropriate response back, however when the function's execution gets to "return artists;", artists is undefined.
[07:35:36] <Elephphant> <ezio> $('select').focus(function(e){e.preventDefault();});
[07:35:52] <ezio> yes
[07:36:00] <ezio> then after preventdefault
[07:36:05] <ezio> is where your logic from
[07:36:20] <ezio> LoadDropDowns
[07:36:22] <ezio> should go
[07:36:37] <Elephphant> thats DataLoadFunction() in my psudo
[07:36:54] <brettfrable> hey guys let's say i have a list with three items - the first list item has a class of selected on it. If the user clicks the second list item - it adds the class selected to that item - and removes it from the first item
[07:36:58] <brettfrable> how would i achieve this
[07:37:02] <ezio> ah yes,
[07:37:30] <mintux> I have a function run inside $(document).ready(function() { }) how can I run it without $(document).ready(function() ... and call it from another where
[07:37:36] <ezio> fiddle around with that shit ... i'ts the only idea i have
[07:38:03] <ezio> Elephphant, also
[07:38:36] <ezio> using mouse instead of focus might be the way to go but you have to determine if the box is open
[07:38:42] <sear> brettfrable: assign the list items ids and keep track of which one is selected.  Then, simply $(selected).removeClass("selected"); $("#toBeSelected").addClass("selected");
[07:38:43] <ezio> mousedown
[07:38:59] <Elephphant> ezio, Needts to be tabable
[07:39:11] <brettfrable> eh - i'm not sure that makes sense
[07:39:38] <sear> brettfrable: What part doesn't make sense?
[07:39:49] <ezio> Elephphant, is tabbing a problem right now?
[07:40:24] <ezio> no
[07:40:29] <ezio> only your click is a problem
[07:40:41] <ezio> you have to put logic between the click and the drop down
[07:41:15] <ezio> oh i got a good idea
[07:41:16] <Elephphant> but it needs to be on focus or i can access it with no data
[07:41:23] <Elephphant> as i dont HAVE to click it :)
[07:41:49] <ezio> just create the select outside of that select and replace it
[07:41:54] <ezio> and then open it
[07:42:09] <ezio> you don't even have to refactor your code
[07:42:34] <mintux> I have this code: http://codepad.org/NsaxPGFj I want this code should be like this : and works again http://codepad.org/fnUkK3Pq
[07:42:41] <guitarguy> sear: try debugging your script by adding a breakpoint on line 9 http://thecodecentral.com/2007/08/01/debug-javascript-with-firebug
[07:42:56] <Elephphant> o.O
[07:43:00] <ezio> Elephphant, but make sure you .click or .focus prevent default
[07:43:27] <ezio> Elephphant, yes ... your drop down box that you're filling here LoadDropDowns
[07:43:40] <ezio> don't fill the drop down that the user can see
[07:43:52] <ezio> just swap it out and open it up
[07:44:10] <ezio> that's about as full hack as it goes
[07:44:10] <Elephphant> i have too many events attached to it to really have that be viable]
[07:44:20] <Elephphant> ]plus being ASP.net controls
[07:44:32] <Elephphant> not reslly going to work as will cause a postback issue
[07:45:02] <Brodingo> brettfrable http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/c7WBA/4/
[07:45:29] <ezio> okay well then try my other idea
[07:45:36] <ezio> either way
[07:45:46] <ezio> chrome did the right thing
[07:47:27] <sear> guitarguy, http://i.imgur.com/1GDC3.png
[07:47:50] <sear> guitarguy, Data was returned properly, but artists was not set.
[07:47:55] <ezio> Elephphant, what you really need is a different way to update that box
[07:48:13] <ezio> the browser doesn't appreciate your ruse
[07:48:48] <Elephphant> The reason im doing it is 1400000 lines of rendered HTML ;)
[07:49:16] <ezio> i can appreciate that, but why does it have to be updated when the user clicks it
[07:49:31] <Elephphant> so they can select a new option
[07:49:47] <ezio> why isn't it already full of the selectable options?
[07:50:02] <Elephphant> Because it causes a 10MB html file when it does :p
[07:50:13] <Elephphant> This is optomisation :)
[07:51:01] <ezio> lstOfLevelsAndPoints is provided by ajax?
[07:51:15] <Elephphant> Dynamic JS file
[07:51:39] <guitarguy> sear: looks like your data variable is a string rather than an object, firefox isn't parsing it, try specifying the content type in the request, and if possible, add the content type header to the http response
[07:52:12] <guitarguy> sear: see the dataType option in jquery.ajax()
[07:52:37] <ezio> Elephphant, but each time they click on the button aren't tehy going to get the same 10mb file?
[07:53:22] <Elephphant> na, when the selects already have the options loaded, the HTML is a 10mb file. The JS is loaded once.
[07:53:31] <Elephphant> Which is an array of objects
[07:53:48] <sear> guitarguy, I checked out contentType in jQuery.ajaxSettings
[07:53:58] <sear> It reads "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"
[07:54:03] <sear> Which should be appropriate, no?
[07:54:07] <ezio> Elephphant, don't do it as an html then, do it as a script in html
[07:55:22] <geque> Hey all! I'm having a wird issue. I have a <pre><code></code></pre> section that includes XML data in the code section. When someone clicks on a button the content is displayed and shows properly. However, If i go and click the button again nothing happens. Looking at the html it looks like the content within the <code> is gone! Has anyone ever seen this before? I can post my handler if needed.
[07:55:52] <sear> guitarguy, Not that aren't correct.  You are.  It seems to be a string when FireFox sees it.
[07:55:57] <ezio> geque, post
[07:57:01] <guitarguy> sear: for the expected response use, dataType: 'json', you may want to set it per request rather than in jquery.ajaxSettings()
[07:57:15] <Elephphant> Regardless of wether it is rendered before or after in js its the sheer mass thats the issue, so if i just load it all at satart with script, will be same issue. But client side rendering not the server
[07:57:30] <sear> guitarguy, That makes sense.  I'll give it a shot.
[07:57:34] <alexidoia> sorry in advanced if this is off topic. I use a input type=file to allow user to fed the form with the name of a file without having to type it in. The drawback is that the file will be uploaded which I don't need. Is there a way to prevent the file to be uploaded but to only upload the filename ? Or is there a best thing to do instead of using this type input
[07:59:03] <sear> guitarguy, Fantastic.  That worked.  Thanks for your help!
[07:59:07] <ezio> is they list dynamic?
[07:59:15] <Dunstkreis> Hey folks out there, i have got a problem in IE7 and IE8 (under XP & 7) with Ajax Requests on secured / httpS connections. IE7&8 are telling me, that there are insecure elements, IE9 and other browsers dont do so. Anyone interessted?
[08:00:52] <shmup> say i'm iterating through each div that has a class repeat-# (repeat-3, repeat-5), in that iteration, how can i grab the number at the end of repeat
[08:00:54] <ezio> Elephphant, is the list dynamic?
[08:01:37] <Elephphant> Yeh
[08:01:46] <ezio> Elephphant, can i see one of your dynamic javascript files
[08:02:04] <ezio> each entry is
[08:02:15] <Elephphant> Its prettry much the JS that was output in example
[08:02:28] <Elephphant>   (new SubjectLevelsAndPoints('U','0.10'))]));
[08:02:30] <Elephphant> those bits
[08:02:30] <ezio> k well you're wasting a lot of bandwidth
[08:02:40] <ezio> by doing that
[08:02:48] <ezio> you should have a very terse json array
[08:03:06] <ezio> then iterate over that array
[08:03:12] <Elephphant> I didnt think of json, why did i not think of json
[08:03:18] <ezio> you're sending 10 times more data
[08:03:21] <ezio> than needed
[08:04:35] <ezio> don't use dynamic js
[08:04:37] <Dunstkreis> Does anybody know if there is a difference how XMLHttpRequests are handelnd throug jQuery in IE7&8 in comparison to IE9 ?
[08:04:41] <ezio> either
[08:04:51] <ezio> ... use something the browser can cache
[08:04:54] <ezio> and only send the json
[08:05:42] <shmup> ......ezio......
[08:06:28] <ezio> shump, sup homie
[08:07:24] <shmup> lol nothin, but you could tell me how you'd grab a, basically substring a class to grab the end of it

[08:07:54] <shmup> boss's
[08:09:19] <brettfrable> last prob - for now…I have three tabs - each tab loads an image gallery. i wrapped up the image gallery - so i moved on to the tabs. I'm loading in the each gallery through jquery .load. I have three .html files. It pulls the gallery div from the page - removes the old gallery - loads in the new gallery
[08:09:30] <brettfrable> my issue is all my js stops working once the new gallery loads in
[08:09:37] <brettfrable> js being lightbox effects, etc.
[08:10:17] <Elephphant> ezio, how would i even store the json. Surely Im printing it as JSON to then cast it to an array and Im just adding an extra layer of abstrations
[08:11:39] <Ojje> Anyone know how to change the linewidth of a line graph on legend hover, using highcharts? :)
[08:11:50] <geque> ezio: sorry first time here..where do you typically post?
[08:14:24] <brettfrable> nvm got it
[08:14:49] <Aquaguy> Hello. Is there any way to get the parent element of an object item?
[08:14:51] <Aquaguy> var foo = { child1 : { name : 'foo1', color : 'blue' }, child2 : { name : 'foo2', color : 'red' }
[08:14:53] <Aquaguy> In this example if I have a reference to child1 is there any way to get foo?
[08:15:25] <Dunstkreis> .parent() ?
[08:18:17] <Aquaguy> Dunstkreis, nope, that doesnt work
[08:22:51] <Dunstkreis> Aquaguy, i guess your question is a kind of general JS and not jQuery Question...?!?
[08:24:30] <Dunstkreis> Aquaguy, this could help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183702/access-parents-parent-from-javascript-object

[08:27:54] <ezio> Elephphant, [{property1:{object}, property2:[{},{}, ..]},..]
[08:28:03] <ezio> so simple
[08:28:17] <Elephphant> An array of JSON
[08:28:24] <ezio> yeah
[08:28:28] <Elephphant> Does that cast properly ?
[08:28:33] <ezio> yuppers
[08:28:44] <ezio> yours would look like
[08:29:12] <ezio> [['1a','11.00],['1a+ ...
[08:29:21] <ezio> missing a quite there
[08:29:25] <ezio> but you goet me
[08:29:28] <geque> ezio: where can i post the code?
[08:29:57] <ezio> jsfiddle.net
[08:30:05] <Dextter> Good afternoon, I forgot how do I get into other channels?
[08:30:14] <Elephphant>   /join

[08:30:47] <Dextter> Thanks
[08:31:51] <ezio> #channelname
[08:32:35] <ezio> Elephphant, what i do is something like this
[08:33:03] <Elephphant> that didnt work btw ezio
[08:33:15] <geque> ezio: http://jsfiddle.net/gUSAy/
[08:34:55] <ezio> var json = "["; for(element in elements) { json.appendformat("['{0}','{1}],"); } if (elements.length > 0) json.remove(json.length - 1, 1); json.append("]");
[08:35:19] <ezio> Elephphant, like i said ... whatever your solution to that is, it's going to be hacky
[08:35:30] <ezio> the browser doesn't like what you're doing and it's frankly wrong

[08:36:08] <Elephphant> Ajax is going to be too unreliable
[08:36:16] <ezio> don't use ajax
[08:36:19] <ezio> put it in your script
[08:36:24] <ezio> i mean
[08:36:25] <ezio> html
[08:36:26] <ezio> not script
[08:36:28] <shoshy> ezio: i'm back.. what reason can make my local code not function (the dragg) like jsfiddle (the works) , i have newer jquery and jquery ui... :/
[08:36:38] <shoshy> tested on the same code..
[08:36:59] <shoshy> the button keeps clicking (despite using mouseup just like you did)
[08:36:59] <ezio> html.appendformat("<script>var mydata = {0};</script>", json);
[08:39:35] <ezio> shoshy, wouldn't know do you haveit live?
[08:39:49] <shoshy> eizo: nope... problematic..
[08:39:53] <shoshy> drives me nuts :)
[08:40:05] <ezio> shump, substring a class?
[08:40:36] <ezio> geque, what's your question
[08:41:25] <ezio> shoshy, i really couldn't say then ... i doubt it's the version, those are core and mature functions
[08:41:48] <shoshy> ezio: right... i'm also using Twitter bootstrap
[08:42:01] <ezio> <3 bootstrap
[08:42:15] <ezio> umm ... shouldn't be an issue buds
[08:42:42] <shoshy> but i doubt if it's because of that... i havent used that button for anything else... baa... ok, thanks ill re-check again... baa maybe CSS affect it? is that logical?
[08:42:44] <ezio> you've missed something small
[08:42:49] <shoshy> (doesn't sound to me)
[08:42:53] <ezio> debug, debug, debug!
[08:43:04] <shoshy> yea..
[08:43:11] <shoshy> i did... it went
[08:43:17] <shoshy> straight to the alert :)
[08:43:22] <shoshy> on the "stop"
[08:43:25] <shoshy> haha
[08:43:54] <ezio> maybe you have more than one binding
[08:44:03] <shoshy> i searched... , i dont :/
[08:44:05] <shoshy> ok, ill re-test stuff.. hopefully ill solve it...
[08:44:09] <shoshy> bbl

[08:46:23] <garciawebdev> are PUT and DELETE HTTP methods supported by most modern browsers and IE7+ ?
[08:48:12] <digs> How could I have 'n' number of .dialog on a single page?
[08:54:31] <digs> http://jsfiddle.net/pb44E/1/
[08:54:38] <digs> There is an example with three buttons.
[08:54:57] <digs> Notice, if you click button 1 and add some text and click save... then click button 2 it has the same text from button 1
[08:55:12] <digs> and there will be 'n' number of buttons on a page.
[08:55:30] <ravenzz> don't use tables for layout dude
[08:55:38] <digs> I don't.
[08:55:44] <digs> I use tables for table data.
[08:55:47] <digs> and CSS for layout.
[08:55:54] <ravenzz> also why are you including jquery 1.4.4
[08:56:03] <digs> because that is the version of jquery this site is running.
[08:56:05] <ravenzz> what
[08:56:10] <ravenzz> the buttons are tabular data?
[08:56:43] <digs> No the buttons are one column that belong to a row of tabular data.
[08:57:03] <digs> and I didn't want to alter the HTML just to create an example to appease.
[08:57:21] <digs> Trust me, I know the difference between using CSS and tables for layout.
[08:57:25] <amcsi-mobile> You need tables for buttons if you ant to middle align multiple rows of text
[08:57:36] <ravenzz> ..
[08:58:09] <ravenzz> digs anyway seems like that you have one dialog
[08:58:15] <ravenzz> instead of 3
[08:58:17] <digs> Right... how do I create N
[08:58:21] <ravenzz> that make sense
[08:58:26] <digs> 3 is just an example.
[08:58:30] <digs> It could be 2 or 99
[08:58:39] <digs> It is dynamic.
[08:58:39] <ravenzz> that's not the point
[08:58:53] <digs> thats my question.
[08:59:13] <digs> How do I accomplish the task of making 3 without physically copying them and changing the id.
[08:59:25] <ravenzz> ?each @ digs
[08:59:39] <digs> .each on what?
[09:00:14] <ravenzz> on the buttons?
[09:00:22] <digs> I am already doing that.
[09:00:58] <ravenzz> no?
[09:01:09] <digs> Can you elaborate please. I do not understand.
[09:01:14] <LindsayMac> digs:  it seems like the issue is that you are just showing/hiding one single input form.. you need to someone append a number to the ID and button... i would think
[09:01:16] <ravenzz> you are triggering the open
[09:01:32] <LindsayMac> So for each input +i ?
[09:02:23] <LindsayMac> SO basically the logic of the code should be that for each "add gift" message (and you would have to add some type of unique identifier for each) ..
[09:02:24] <ravenzz> you need to create a dialog for each button OR have one dialog
[09:02:26] <digs> LindsayMac, okay. That was my original thought, I just hoping there was a more "clean" way to do.
[09:02:34] <ravenzz> and reset its own value every time you open it
[09:02:38] <amcsi-mobile> Id's are evil. Only use them in ExtJS
[09:02:38] <LindsayMac> you need to append that unique identifier to the text box/ submit
[09:02:48] <digs> okay. I can do that easily enough.
[09:02:56] <amcsi-mobile> And use event delegation
[09:03:01] <LindsayMac> ravenzz:  resetting the original value wouldn't help saving the data uniquely though.. ?
[09:03:36] <amcsi-mobile> And use data- attributes
[09:03:43] <LindsayMac> yea agree with that..
[09:03:56] <ravenzz> Lindrian well considering that the input field type is submit I guess he want to submit just one value
[09:04:16] <digs> I will include the add gift form in each row of data and append a unique id to each.
[09:04:20] <LindsayMac> I guess I assumed that each button would submit additional values.. so one for each
[09:04:30] <digs> Then I can associate the input with that div easily.
[09:04:41] <LindsayMac> digs:  that makes sense.
[09:04:42] <digs> LindsayMac, yes, one for each.
[09:04:59] <digs> okay. thanks guys.
[09:05:03] <ravenzz> I don't know I am half drunk lol
[09:05:10] <LindsayMac> sadly.. while I can work out the logic of how things can work.. I am not good enough at JS yet to tell you HOW to do it ;)
[09:05:18] <ravenzz> but I think that you want to submit one value at time
[09:05:35] <Squiggle> hi
[09:05:48] <LindsayMac> ravenzz:  maybe THAT can help you with my issue, because i've been working on this sober for days and still can't work out the answer.
[09:06:10] <LindsayMac> ravenzz:  yes but you would want to associate each one value with it's one button..
[09:06:20] <LindsayMac> otherwise, ravenzz, why have multiple buttons? Just have one
[09:06:35] <amcsi-mobile> What is the question btw?
[09:06:42] <LindsayMac> grabbing the code no amcsi-mobile
[09:07:38] <LindsayMac> amcsi-mobile:  just walked in the door so I have to bring myself up to speed where i ended last night
[09:07:43] <ravenzz> LindsayMac well each time you submit you are supposed to send the element you are going to add the gift message for
[09:07:43] <digs> ravenzz, I am going to do an ajax call and save the contents of that dialog into the database each time they open one and click save. After each one on the page is successfully saved, the user can move forward.
[09:07:51] <ravenzz> see ^
[09:07:56] <ravenzz> 1 at the time
[09:08:08] <digs> so, how does that change my approach ravenzz?
[09:08:34] <LindsayMac> ravenzz:  digs ... so if it's one at a time, why do you need multiple buttons?
[09:08:46] <digs> because each button is associated with a single client of the user.
[09:08:53] <ravenzz> digs ok hold on
[09:08:55] <LindsayMac> huh?
[09:08:58] <ravenzz> I'll do that for you
[09:09:05] <digs> okay
[09:09:08] <LindsayMac> I figured button1 would save gift message for product1 and button2 would save it for product2
[09:09:35] <digs> LindsayMac, yes that is true. except products=clients in this case.
[09:09:44] <LindsayMac> Ahhhh ok.
[09:09:54] <digs> I think you two are describing the same thing in different ways.
[09:09:59] <LindsayMac> So each button is for each clients (n)
[09:10:03] <digs> yes.
[09:10:29] <LindsayMac> I guess we are... there's always multiple ways to complete something in JS I am learning
[09:10:34] <LindsayMac> well, in other languages too..
[09:10:43] <LindsayMac> but JS seems to be the most flexible
[09:11:10] <digs> well, it is the nature of the DOM that creates that flexibility.
[09:11:28] <LindsayMac> digs:  and i HATE IT`
[09:11:28] <LindsayMac> haha
[09:11:32] <digs> heh
[09:11:57] <LindsayMac> I like my php...
[09:12:04] <LindsayMac> i yam what i yam
[09:12:08] <Atty> hey so I have this <label class="cb-enable selected"><span>On</span></label> but how do I get the value?
[09:13:09] <Atty> basically its a ibutton is what it says but it dont store no form variable. So How the hell do you use it?
[09:13:16] <digs> brb
[09:14:20] <ryanneufeld> Atty: What value are you looking for? That isn't an input, there is no value
[09:15:24] <Atty> I understand that.. there isnt a input. but supposedly its supposed to work. its using $(".cb-enable").click(function(){
[09:15:24] <Atty> 		  var parent = $(this).parents('.switch');
[09:15:24] <Atty> 		  $('.cb-disable',parent).removeClass('selected');
[09:15:24] <Atty> 		  $(this).addClass('selected');
[09:15:24] <Atty> 		  $('.checkbox',parent).attr('checked', true);
[09:15:25] <Atty> 	});
[09:15:37] <ryanneufeld> ?paste @ Atty
[09:15:59] <Brodingo> datepicker question: can i set a hidden datepicker to 30 days of where it is?
[09:16:07] <Atty> and ofcourse a cd-disable..
[09:16:21] <Atty> I just dont understand where the hell or how the hell to get the variable..
[09:16:32] <Atty> its a simple on/off or yes/no
[09:16:33] <ryanneufeld> Atty: don't paste code in here
[09:16:41] <ryanneufeld> use pastebin or jsfiddle
[09:16:43] <Atty> sorry ryan
[09:16:44] <ryanneufeld> please
[09:16:56] <ryanneufeld> Brodingo: yes, you can, I give you permission
[09:18:06] <digs> ravenzz - i need to take care of something in RL real quick but i will back in about 20min and will read scroll bakc.
[09:18:09] <digs> maybe 30.
[09:19:18] <LindsayMac> amcsi-mobile: Ok so I have the code that is here: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/vaTWq/4/  the goal of that code is to use scrollTo to go to a panel and then if the panel has a class "whiteboxpanel" it will fade in content AND animate the height of that white box. That all worked fine but I needed to disable clicking while both of those animations are in progress. It works in the fiddle, but not on my site and I ha
[09:19:18] <LindsayMac> ve no idea why
[09:20:04] <Atty> http://pastebin.com/jSukfWvH
[09:20:06] <LindsayMac> amcsi:  USUALLY i dont have an issue with finding the conflicting code, but right now I am a little lost
[09:20:20] <Atty> there is a link ryan at my code..
[09:20:29] <Brodingo> ryanneufeld http://i.qkme.me/3om1i6.jpg
[09:20:35] <LindsayMac> not to mention I can't get chrome installed on my computer and thus can't use the debug tools there
[09:20:57] <ryanneufeld> Brodingo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoPVC4YxDlI&feature=related
[09:21:18] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: Firebug? or Firebug Lite?
[09:21:27] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  i am using firebug
[09:21:31] <ryanneufeld> Atty: I'm looking
[09:22:21] <ryanneufeld> Atty: does this code change the state in a way you're happy with?
[09:24:26] <Atty> It just goes from on to off. but I want to store the variable.
[09:24:35] <ryanneufeld> you mean the value
[09:24:41] <Atty> yes true or false
[09:24:57] <Atty> I just dont know how to get the value to my action page.
[09:26:47] <ryanneufeld> Atty: http://pastebin.com/rgTHTnNe
[09:26:58] <ryanneufeld> I think you'll find that sort of thing will be less code to do the same thing
[09:27:39] <Atty> ok but how do i get the value?
[09:27:45] <ryanneufeld> then you can just call var isChecked = $('.ibtn_t1').data('checked');
[09:28:00] <ryanneufeld> read up on .data() on the docs
[09:28:03] <ryanneufeld> and what it means
[09:28:29] <ryanneufeld> also if this is for a form, i would suggest using a hidden input, or even a checkbox that is hidden with css.
[09:29:36] <Atty> yes its for a form..
[09:29:59] <Atty> so i really didnt get my question answered??
[09:30:22] <LindsayMac> Atty:  whats the question?? How to pass data from your form to a db?
[09:30:30] <gnarf> Atty: you should use a hidden <input type="checkbox"> to store the state
[09:30:39] <ryanneufeld> Atty, handed you the answer
[09:30:43] <ryanneufeld> *I handed
[09:31:00] <Atty> well your answer was not understood.
[09:31:30] <ryanneufeld> Atty: soooo.....? what do we do when we don't understand?
[09:31:41] <ryanneufeld> Ask for more clarification
[09:31:44] <ryanneufeld> which you did
[09:31:46] <Atty> im still asking questions arent i
[09:31:50] <ryanneufeld> then you can just call var isChecked = $('.ibtn_t1').data('checked');
[09:32:04] <geekbuntu> gnarf, later - if you have time, do you have a link to your latest queue script? the one i have is dated around 2010 i think - heard there was a later version. tia,
[09:32:05] <Atty> ryan thats the part I dont get
[09:32:19] <ryanneufeld> Atty: and i told you to read the docs
[09:32:20] <gnarf> geekbuntu: ajaxQueue?
[09:32:23] <gnarf> ?ajaxQueue
[09:32:25] <gnarf> damn
[09:32:27] <gnarf> no bot-t
[09:32:27] <geekbuntu> gnarf, yup
[09:32:44] <LindsayMac> ^^
[09:32:48] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/1039247
[09:32:52] <gnarf> that should be newest
[09:32:53] <geekbuntu> ty gnarf
[09:33:00] <ryanneufeld> doh, he left
[09:33:09] <LindsayMac> sad..
[09:33:10] <ryanneufeld> I was gonna give hime this http://api.jquery.com/data/
[09:33:29] <ryanneufeld> well, it seems he didn't have a basic understanding of how forms work
[09:33:49] <ryanneufeld> which is rather difficult to help with
[09:33:53] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  which is usually ok if the person is willing to LEARN
[09:34:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I handed him code that solved his problem, told him how to use it, and then told him to read the docs
[09:34:21] <ryanneufeld> not much more I am willing to do
[09:34:33] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: just make it work!
[09:34:54] <ryanneufeld> I don't mind helping people, but when you don't want to learn, I have no interest in perpetuating you're bad code on the internet :P
[09:34:58] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  well.. being someone who is learning this language myself, i feel like most times that would be enough, and when it's not you come back with additional questions.. not really waiting for someone to do it for you
[09:35:02] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: NO!
[09:35:04] <ryanneufeld> lol
[09:35:13] <LindsayMac> its a mass exodus
[09:35:18] <LindsayMac> ^^
[09:35:43] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: i've been watching how you ask questions, I'd never have a problem helping you.
[09:35:58] <ryanneufeld> you always take what is said, learn, attempt to understand, and then apply it
[09:36:08] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  thanks! this isn't my first rodeo .. just first time with JS
[09:36:20] <ryanneufeld> then you share it again with others, that's kinda the point here
[09:36:24] <LindsayMac> but yes, it is appreciated to know that people don't THINK i'm just looking for folks to do it for me
[09:36:32] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  ALWAYS
[09:37:19] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld: i've actually got a notebook of captured code and tagged with what it does so I can look back if i need it (or someone else might in the room)
[09:37:22] <ryanneufeld> well, the "here's my code, it's not doing what I want, help" is better than "HOW DO I MAKE CLICKY THINGS GO"
[09:37:31] <LindsayMac> HAHAHAHA
[09:37:58] <LindsayMac> and ryanneufeld if you ever need some help with php or even wordpress, i'm happy ot help on that front/
[09:38:21] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: http://www.metrolyrics.com/team.html <- Find me there
[09:38:23] <LindsayMac> I'm kinda a weird hybrid of designer (graphic design) and back end without any knowledge of js
[09:38:30] <LindsayMac> :found
[09:38:39] <ryanneufeld> thanks, the wordpress stuff, I think I may take you up on
[09:38:55] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  I havent come across something I can't do with wordpress
[09:39:25] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  my husband is a very talented photographer as well..
[09:39:38] <ryanneufeld> I can usually persuade it, square peg, round hole... but it works :P
[09:39:51] <LindsayMac> haha well thats better than some@
[09:39:56] <gnarf> Pretty soon LindsayMac will be on the team at that rate ;)
[09:40:10] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  the team?
[09:40:14] <LindsayMac> I wanna be on a team!
[09:40:18] <ryanneufeld> The game... ?
[09:40:34] <LindsayMac> the game: shoving square pegs into round holes
[09:40:44] <LindsayMac> the team: a bunch of designer/developers who desperately make that happen
[09:40:54] <ryanneufeld> Welcome to metrolyrics.com
[09:40:55] <ryanneufeld> lol
[09:41:29] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  seems like a cool platform
[09:41:46] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's alright

[09:43:13] <gnarf> http://jquery.org/team/
[09:43:22] <LindsayMac> and a fun ven diagram http://creativesupplyco.com/services/
[09:43:30] <ezio> LindsayMac, that is you?>
[09:43:46] <LindsayMac> ezio:  erm.. yes. I just said it was.
[09:43:57] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  i wouldn't want to be the "developer relations lead" hahaha
[09:44:11] <ryanneufeld> gnarf's good peeps
[09:44:11] <gnarf> ask ajpiano about that one, its not too bad ;)
[09:44:13] <ezio> yes ... i said it last night ... you're pretty darn creative
[09:44:25] <LindsayMac> thanks.
[09:44:44] <LindsayMac> i like to think so.. and as i said.. JS is where my designs always fail because i have great interaction ideas that I can NOT make happen
[09:45:33] <Brodingo> datepicker >:|
[09:45:43] <ajpiano> somehow i persevere
[09:45:46] <ajpiano> it's true
[09:45:50] <Brodingo> is it like, fundementally broken in 1.7?
[09:46:06] <LindsayMac> ajpiano:  hahaha... doesn't seem like the funnest job
[09:46:13] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: you planning on going to jquery.to btw?
[09:46:22] <ryanneufeld> dunno man
[09:46:25] <ryanneufeld> I'd like to
[09:46:30] <ezio> LindsayMac, did you do the graphics?
[09:46:35] <ryanneufeld> we need to drink some beers
[09:46:41] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  http://bscphoto.com <~~~ my husband
[09:46:43] <LindsayMac> ezio:  yes.
[09:46:58] <ajpiano> LindsayMac: it's not riding a unicorn through candyland but it ain't too bad
[09:47:04] <LindsayMac> ezio:  as I was learning code, I was doing graphic design with branding and identity
[09:47:17] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: I say this with all due respect
[09:47:20] <LindsayMac> hahaha ajpiano
[09:47:29] <ryanneufeld> FUCKING GREY TEXT ON A GREY BACKROUND RAGE!!!!!!!
[09:47:38] <ktstowell> lulz
[09:47:46] <Brodingo> LindsayMac site looks nice.. header is a bit cramped no?
[09:47:48] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  well.. my husband "designed" that site.... i fought him on most of it, but he designed it so i made it
[09:47:49] <abletony84> pffffft
[09:47:59] <Brodingo> could use some breathing room
[09:48:03] <LindsayMac> not to mention it was made/designed YEARS ago
[09:48:09] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: well, a photog he may be, but a designer he aint
[09:48:14] <ryanneufeld> :P
[09:48:31] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  he's actually a great graphic designer.. just no clue about the web
[09:48:32] <abletony84> LindsayMac: can i see too?
[09:48:34] <LindsayMac> like.. at all
[09:48:37] <ScottG> So I have a dropdown box that has a focus out. I also have a table that uses the jquery ui selectable(). My problem is that when I click on a item on the selectable table, the downdown box doesn't seem to lose focus. Why is this?
[09:48:43] <abletony84> wanna see what these cats are hating on
[09:48:43] <LindsayMac> abletony84:  http://bscphoto.com
[09:49:00] <iwoj> If I have an index number representing a single point within an HTML document, how can I find out what DOM element it is in?
[09:49:01] <LindsayMac> lol abletony84
[09:49:03] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: you should, like re-build it for him... cause it's painful to see great shots ruined by a bad exp
[09:49:16] <Brodingo> im trying to use setDate with the datepicker but it seems completely unresponsive...
[09:49:18] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  one day... one day... we've both been so crazy busy that theres no time
[09:49:25] <ryanneufeld> I hear ya
[09:49:27] <LindsayMac> I mean, if a redesign brought in more work, we couldnt handle it anyways
[09:49:31] * abletony84 clicks like
[09:49:38] <ryanneufeld> same reason I don't have my photo site up
[09:49:56] <abletony84> never seen anybody in here front a design at that level
[09:50:07] <LindsayMac> abletony84:  huh?
[09:50:22] <LindsayMac> You all should see the kickass design i am working on now that I CANT SEEM TO GET THE JS RIGHT ON!
[09:50:36] <abletony84> oh yeah?
[09:50:43] <LindsayMac> it's one of the prettiest designs i've done but have been struggling with JS for weeks now
[09:51:04] <abletony84> i wanna see!
[09:51:12] <LindsayMac> it has almost brought me to tears twice... but then i sacked up
[09:51:13] * abletony84 gets ready to go "daaaaaaaaaaaaamn"
[09:51:16] <ezio> wow ... k ... i'll think about working with you but i'm just going back to school in september.  i'll have a much more flexible shedule at that point
[09:51:18] <LindsayMac> abletony84:  PM me your IP address
[09:51:32] <abletony84> uhm okay
[09:51:49] <LindsayMac> abletony84:  its on a dev environment that only allows specified IPs
[09:52:02] <ryanneufeld> sent you mine
[09:52:07] <abletony84> i understand
[09:52:08] <iwoj> How can I find a DOM element given only a string index representing a point within an HTML document?
[09:52:27] <ryanneufeld> iwoj: without context it's impossible to answer that question
[09:52:28] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  ok.. gimme a minute beause I have to take the broken code out so you can see it
[09:52:45] <ryanneufeld> iwoj: make a jsfiddle.net example please
[09:53:25] <ezio> iwoj, i think you're nuts
[09:53:29] <gnarf> "a string index" ?
[09:53:29] <iwoj> uh...
[09:53:43] <gnarf> iwoj: why not just use a CSS selector?
[09:53:52] <ezio> where would you get this index from?  you know that the dom changes a lot during rendering
[09:54:48] <ravenzz> gnarf
[09:55:02] <iwoj> http://jsfiddle.net/nZP4L/
[09:55:05] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz
[09:55:07] <ravenzz> I see that this solution http://jsfiddle.net/sCjhs/ is a nightmare
[09:55:19] <iwoj> all I have is an index
[09:55:40] <ryanneufeld> iwoj: how are you getting the index?
[09:55:50] <ezio> do you have a static html file that is not being rendered or are you trying to pull that out of the dom?
[09:55:59] <ravenzz> is there a performance friendly way to do the same? (share one dialog)
[09:56:01] <iwoj> http://jsfiddle.net/nZP4L/
[09:56:02] <ezio> if the html file is static
[09:56:10] <ezio> you can just reduce the index until you find <
[09:56:31] <iwoj> so … brute force….
[09:56:41] <gnarf> jesus
[09:56:44] <iwoj> there's no jQuery of JS method that will do this for me?
[09:56:47] <ryanneufeld> no
[09:56:49] <gnarf> iwoj: add an ID or a class to the element
[09:57:02] <ezio> yeah do what i told you to do
[09:57:04] <gnarf> never use text to find an element, its WAY bad
[09:57:04] <iwoj> gnarf: what element?
[09:57:04] <ezio> look for >
[09:57:13] <ezio> then for d and i
[09:57:19] <ryanneufeld> iwoj: can you expand your explanation of the problem? What is the total problem you are trying to solve
[09:57:25] <ezio> or even " = d i
[09:57:33] <ryanneufeld> iwoj: like where is the html coming from?
[09:57:34] <therealklanni> If you try to find any element using a string you're gonna have a bad time
[09:57:39] <ryanneufeld> ^^
[09:57:56] <iwoj> that's life
[09:58:10] <iwoj> ryanneufeld: I'm trying to set a selection.
[09:58:23] <ezio> well then ... rangy
[09:58:32] <iwoj> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/range
[09:58:38] <ezio> look for javascript rangy
[09:58:50] <iwoj> ezio: thanks!
[09:58:51] <ezio> http://code.google.com/p/rangy/
[09:59:01] <iwoj> *bows*
[09:59:07] <iwoj> to ezio
[09:59:30] * ezio curtsys
[10:02:21] <LindsayMac> even learn something.. go to sleep, and completely forget it?
[10:02:23] <LindsayMac> WTF
[10:02:58] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: I forgot math once
[10:03:07] <SeanLazer> what's the best way to make something like $(element).miniColors() attach itself to the parent object (aka make it 'live')
[10:03:11] <digs> ravenzz - yeah, I think I will do the way that creates multiple dialogs
[10:03:12] <LindsayMac> me too! what a coinkydink
[10:03:14] <Teduardo> if you have a var like this: $('#bw_in_str').text(bw_in_str); how do you output the text of it in a <div></div>?
[10:03:18] <digs> thanks for doing that though.
[10:03:43] <ravenzz> digs yep
[10:03:47] <ravenzz> I think that is a better idea
[10:03:50] <digs> That is one workable approach. The only issue thing that having multiple dialog divs on the page affords, which is very nice, is being able to edit them.
[10:03:56] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: your question doesn't make senes
[10:03:59] <dogarrhea2> LindsayMac: sounds like you are coinkydrunk
[10:04:09] <LindsayMac> no
[10:04:28] <dogarrhea2> i can help change that
[10:04:33] <digs> thanks for the help ravenzz
[10:04:50] <ryanneufeld> Teduardo: you mean you you want to wrap the bw_in_string in a div, and put that inside the element you've selected?
[10:04:52] <SeanLazer> ryanneufeld: i probably didn't word it well.  say I want to do $(element).miniColors()  (replace miniColors() with basically any plugin call) but I want it to work on instances of element that haven't been created yet
[10:05:05] <dogarrhea2> is $e0 a valid identifier in javascript/jquery?
[10:05:06] <LindsayMac> how do i get a function to trigger on initial page load AND scroll.. i have $(window).scroll(function and I had somethign before that worked and stinkin lost it!
[10:05:10] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: that depends on the plugin to do that
[10:05:14] <zeropx> LindsayMac: Your comment reminded me of a quote “Study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in.”
[10:05:14] <zeropx> ― Leonardo da Vinci
[10:05:35] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: you can use .on() to say attach it on the click handler of an item that doesn't yet exist.
[10:05:45] <LindsayMac> zeropx:  or... study until you are blue in the face and almost about to pass out and you take nothing in either.. hah..
[10:05:59] <ryanneufeld> I was drunk
[10:06:03] <ryanneufeld> that's why I forgot math
[10:06:03] <zeropx> LindsayMac: that works to. :D
[10:06:10] <dogarrhea2> that's when you bust out the coke.
[10:06:12] <SeanLazer> ryanneufeld: right, that works in some cases
[10:06:15] <dogarrhea2> -a cola
[10:06:16] <ravenzz> yw
[10:06:45] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: well, unless the plugin you're using supports binding to elements using live/on. You'd have to do that. Or bind when the element is created later
[10:07:03] <iwoj> ezio: looks like rangy doesn't do what I need
[10:07:11] <iwoj> I'm going to have to roll my own solution.
[10:07:18] <ezio> what you need is crazy talk
[10:07:32] <SeanLazer> ryanneufeld: i'm guessing there's no hook for instantiation.  $('body').on('create', 'my-selector', …) would be nice
[10:08:01] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: there are DOM change events you can bind to, but I don't recommend them.
[10:08:18] <SeanLazer> i'll just make the user have to click into the field i guess
[10:08:26] <iwoj>  ?
[10:08:32] <ryanneufeld> just to be sure, using doc ready won't help you?
[10:08:55] <Teduardo> ryanneufeld: I basically just want to be able to do something like <div id="bw"></div> in the html and have it automatically print the contents of bw_in_str and bw_out_str in that div... i hope that makes sense
[10:08:56] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: if you're adding a field w/ jquery, then you can bind to that feild then
[10:09:12] <SeanLazer> ryanneufeld: i kind of am but i'm trying to keep my concerns separated
[10:09:13] <ryanneufeld> Teduardo: not really
[10:09:30] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: you can use custom events
[10:09:38] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: like a cheap pubsub
[10:09:45] <ryanneufeld> or even using promises
[10:09:49] <SeanLazer> ryanneufeld: oh i suppose that's true, eh?
[10:09:51] <ryanneufeld> *deferreds
[10:09:54] <LindsayMac> Ok.. how do I call a function not only on scroll but on window load as well?
[10:09:57] <ryanneufeld> yeah, there is all kinds of ways
[10:10:02] <LindsayMac>   I did it once and lost it!!   $(window).scroll(function() {
[10:10:06] <ryanneufeld> .on('load')
[10:10:13] <Teduardo> ryanneufeld: okay, if I do alert(bw_in_str); it shows me a box with the content I want to display inline in my html... im just trying to figure out how I can display it inline in the html; In php it would be <?php echo $bw_in_str;?>
[10:10:23] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: I would use doc.ready though
[10:10:26] <SeanLazer> ryanneufeld: i'm updating an edit field so i could just do $('body').trigger('formUpdate')
[10:10:48] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  i have the whole thing in a doc.ready... but.. damn I can't find it in my notes!
[10:10:51] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: yeah, and have a .on('formUpdate')
[10:10:57] <iwoj> I've been trying to join the javascript channel, but it doesn't seem to respond.
[10:11:02] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: then you have a late binding
[10:11:08] <iwoj> is there a special command I need to issue?
[10:11:09] <SeanLazer> ryanneufeld: that's not a bad idea, thanks!
[10:11:22] <ryanneufeld> SeanLazer: I hope it's a good one :P
[10:12:12] <ryanneufeld> Teduardo: $('the selector of the div you want to put it in').html(bw_in_str);
[10:12:15] <ryanneufeld> shoudl do it
[10:12:30] <ezio> http://imgur.com/gallery/yBH0l
[10:12:40] <ryanneufeld> crazy russians
[10:14:14] <LindsayMac> I had something like $(window) 'scroll , 'load' (function but now i cant find it!
[10:14:34] <fanthomas> I would like to add a button to every autocomplete item so a form can be sumbitted, is there a way to do that? On clicking the button select event is triggered and prevents the button to submit the form...
[10:15:53] <iwoj> ezio: looking for > isn't that simple. I need to create a Node object (a DOMElement). Just finding the > isn't enough.
[10:17:28] <ezio> iwoj, rethink what you're doing cause it doesn't sound like you know
[10:17:31] <iwoj> http://jsfiddle.net/nZP4L/
[10:17:53] <iwoj> ezio: I know what I'm doing, I just don't know how to get there.
[10:18:07] <iwoj> without building a lot of stuff to support it
[10:18:14] <iwoj> i know there's got to be an easier way
[10:18:49] <ezio> i don't know either iwoj
[10:18:59] <ezio> sounds like voodoo
[10:19:19] <iwoj> I would like to be able to set a text selection in a webpage given a start and end index
[10:19:53] <iwoj> with the text selection API (including rangy), you need to specify a start and end DOM element
[10:20:26] <iwoj> but in the app that I'm building, the best that I can produce is a start and end index
[10:20:27] <ryanneufeld> iwoj: regexp
[10:20:35] <iwoj> … yes ...
[10:21:19] <iwoj> how would I use regexp to help? a start and end index may not be in an element with an ID
[10:23:31] <iwoj> http://jsfiddle.net/nZP4L/2/
[10:24:47] <iwoj> Here's the problem, as clearly as I can put it:
[10:24:48] <iwoj> http://jsfiddle.net/nZP4L/4/
[10:26:58] <gnarf> LindsayMac: function doThisUpdate() {}  $(window).on("scroll", doThisUpdate); $( doThisUpdate );  --- ?
[10:27:09] <iwoj> maybe there's a jquery plugin that will do this...
[10:27:12] <geekbuntu> is there a way to make autocomplete case insensitive using the native jquery-ui method?
[10:27:18] <gnarf> LindsayMac: also $(window).on("scroll load", doThisUpdate);
[10:27:28] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  THAT is it.. the last one..
[10:27:37] <LindsayMac> doThisUpdate would be my function?
[10:27:55] <gnarf> LindsayMac: yeah, I very rarely use anonymous functions for event handlers anymore
[10:28:01] <ML74> Anyone got any links to login form tutorials?
[10:28:05] <gnarf> LindsayMac: i suggest using named functions where possible :)
[10:28:30] <gnarf> especially if you need to use it for more than one thing
[10:28:41] <jdeuce> iwoj: there
[10:28:46] <geekbuntu> ML74: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CG0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdesignmodo.com%2Flogin-form-css3-jquery%2F&ei=vqEiUO3VNuaI6AHBhoD4DQ&usg=AFQjCNFQ-ijzQk8Rfoy_fni1f_K6ig-9hQ&sig2=JGIy3ucHwAKTY5m3VUghIQ
[10:28:50] <jdeuce> you just want to select some text?
[10:28:57] <LindsayMac> So like this: https://gist.github.com/5a05d7de3a5aa7ca3dd8
[10:29:00] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  ^^
[10:29:08] <geekbuntu> ML74: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CG8QFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catswhocode.com%2Fblog%2F10-jquery-tutorials-for-working-with-html-forms&ei=vqEiUO3VNuaI6AHBhoD4DQ&usg=AFQjCNFQQudsho4-XpQEuH95aHol4XGbQw&sig2=UGmcasmFuMNWRuPy8Qa9mw
[10:29:11] <geekbuntu> sheesh... sorry
[10:29:16] <gnarf> LindsayMac: function myFunction( event ) { ... }
[10:29:18] <geekbuntu> google is getting ornery
[10:30:18] <iwoj> jdeuce: yes. I just want to select some text.
[10:30:38] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  this? https://gist.github.com/164ef83e623bf87eda87
[10:30:42] <LindsayMac> no thats not right.. hold on
[10:30:42] <gnarf> LindsayMac: https://gist.github.com/6830292f437578b5b84a
[10:30:58] <ScottG> So I have a dropdown box that has a focus out. I also have a table that uses the jquery ui selectable(). My problem is that when I click on a item on the selectable table, the downdown box doesn't seem to lose focus. Why is this?
[10:31:00] <iwoj> http://jsfiddle.net/nZP4L/7/
[10:31:46] <gnarf> LindsayMac: cache $(window) - https://gist.github.com/6830292f437578b5b84a
[10:32:29] <jdeuce> iwoj: and the text can span multiple elements? you can't put all the text into one div or something?
[10:32:53] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  i dunno if that's needed .. or appropriate in this scenaior (i could be wrong of course) but i have a bunch of stuff going on in this script.. trying to tame it.. I literaly previously had ONE line of code that I changed to make it work, i just lost it
[10:32:56] <iwoj> jdeuce: that's right. it might span multiple elements.
[10:33:08] <geekbuntu> gnarf - couldn't the attr('id be retrieved by the .closest('div (parent)?
[10:33:13] <ML74> I need a login that runs the login php script. If successful, redirect. If not, display error. But I don't want the page to reload. Anyone got any ideas?
[10:33:18] <iwoj> but if I can just get an element from an index point, i should be fine.
[10:33:29] <gnarf> geekbuntu: ?
[10:34:00] <gnarf> LindsayMac: any time you use the window scroll event, every single bit of performance is important, it will make scrolling feel slow if the function is slow
[10:34:02] <lacrymology> I've got a link that returns a file, I'd need to force the browser to reload the page after the file starts downloading, how can I do it?
[10:34:05] <iwoj> basically, I want document.getElementAtIndex(somenumber)
[10:34:14] <geekbuntu> ML74: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/submit-a-form-without-page-refresh-using-jquery/
[10:34:25] <iwoj> instead of document.getElementById(someID)
[10:34:28] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  ok.. so right now I have to work what you gave into my code.. the right way ..
[10:37:40] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  GOT IT!! Thanks a bunch
[10:37:57] <gnarf> LindsayMac: i suggest http://eloquentjavascript.net btw
[10:38:32] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  thanks.. I will definitely take a look.. this (what I have) is NOT eloquent..
[10:38:34] <LindsayMac> this i know
[10:39:33] <gnarf> LindsayMac: :) there are some good practices hiding in there :)
[10:41:09] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  I will definitely read through.. i am SOOO far behind with jS.
[10:41:21] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  if you wanna see the site i'm working on, you can PM your IP and I'll give you entry
[10:42:21] <iwoj> Ok y'all. here's my solution:
[10:42:22] <iwoj> http://jsfiddle.net/nZP4L/8/
[10:42:48] <WebDragon> hey LindsayMac
[10:43:07] <WebDragon> brushin' up on jquery?
[10:43:32] <Zerpex> yooooo guys! :D I'm sitting here implementing FlexSlider - but I want it to animate in, so when the slider loads first time it should fadeIn or something: http://pastebin.com/8LtRkU1c
[10:44:04] <LindsayMac> hey WebDragon
[10:44:13] <LindsayMac> brushing up?? learning for the most part
[10:44:34] * WebDragon buries a sudden chuckle deep in his coffemug.
[10:44:40] <WebDragon> heh I know the feeling sometimes
[10:45:07] <WebDragon> I've just aquired a project that'll involve my first excursion into transactional SQL and php's PDO
[10:45:24] <silverwind> Welcome to hell..
[10:45:33] <WebDragon> jquery's _fun_ though
[10:45:37] <silverwind> Unless you're on a green field.
[10:45:48] <ScottG> I made a jsfiddle to demonstrate how making an element selectable seems to eliminate it from causing other elements to lose focus:
[10:45:51] <ScottG> http://jsfiddle.net/ScottG489/mu5kQ/
[10:45:51] <WebDragon> or a cold steel rail
[10:46:15] <LindsayMac> WebDragon:  jquery is about as fun as being dipped in honey and dropped in a bee farm
[10:46:18] <WebDragon> ... a smile from a veil ..
[10:46:23] * WebDragon hums along
[10:46:34] <silverwind> MMmm... Honyey
[10:46:39] <ScottG> Notice if you comment out the js it loses focus fine. Something about the selectable messes it up.
[10:46:41] <silverwind> *Honey even..
[10:46:42] <LindsayMac> WebDragon: what kinda fun php project is that?
[10:46:42] <WebDragon> oh that's so not true. jquery's frigging _elegant_ compared to doing the js by hand
[10:46:58] <LindsayMac> Oh well yes.. yes it is..
[10:47:09] <LindsayMac> but not compared to php (i like php if you can't tell)
[10:47:10] <WebDragon> that's part of what makes it fun for me, anyway.
[10:47:13] <WebDragon> heehee
[10:47:14] <silverwind> Pure JS isn't that bad if you don't need the hacks for IE
[10:47:21] <ScottG> Some things are still a little more elegant is straight JS
[10:47:28] <WebDragon> silverwind: ah yes, well.. there is that
[10:47:29] <ScottG> in*
[10:47:48] <silverwind> Pure JS has querySelector/All now
[10:47:49] <silverwind> ;)
[10:48:12] <WebDragon> LindsayMac: the php project is some sort of medical database thing (not too complicated but I'm still doping out the schema from their tentative first notes/plan/spreadsheet)
[10:48:27] * WebDragon chews some aspirin
[10:48:34] <LindsayMac> WebDragon:  thats strange.. i'm working on a media booking system!
[10:48:36] <silverwind> WebDragon: Read about normalization if you didn't
[10:48:39] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: have you used .stop() before?
[10:49:01] <WebDragon> silverwind: trying to talk my boss into the Safari Bookshelf so I can read up as much as needed
[10:49:03] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  yes...
[10:49:11] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: I'm totally digging this, and I see the problem, you need to stop the animations
[10:49:20] <ryanneufeld> whenever there is a click on the menu
[10:49:33] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  i tried using .stop but because i'm also using .css i read that .stop doesnt work on that
[10:49:33] <WebDragon> found a decent book on PDO that goes into a little more detail than the online docs http://wiki.hashphp.org/PDO_Tutorial_for_MySQL_Developers
[10:49:43] <LindsayMac> not to mention i need to stop three separate interactions ryanneufeld
[10:49:55] <LindsayMac> scroll animation, fade in animation, and animate height
[10:49:57] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: well, you can manage that with queues
[10:50:12] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: why scroll?
[10:50:15] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  i had started looking into dequeue and clearqueue
[10:50:22] <ryanneufeld> is that so it works when there is no js
[10:50:23] <ryanneufeld> ?
[10:50:44] <WebDragon> remember that .stop() also has features like .stop(true,true)
[10:50:45] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  not sure what you mean...  ?
[10:50:57] <LindsayMac> i dont USUALLY worry too much, in this 2012, about js being disabled.
[10:51:02] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: Well, why are you using the scrollTo
[10:51:11] <ryanneufeld> doesn't seem relevant here
[10:51:26] <ryanneufeld> you can just use the animations to slideup/down the content of the hidden divs
[10:51:34] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  without the smooth scroll effect, you dont get that "curtain" effect of the images behind the images
[10:51:41] <ML74> using $.ajax, how can i post to the php validation script, then display an error based on what's returned?
[10:51:53] <ryanneufeld> oh, you want that effect of seeing each picture as you're changing pages?
[10:52:00] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  yea...
[10:52:13] <ryanneufeld> oh, I would say that's cool and all
[10:52:21] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  but now that you mention it.. i COULD use a "slideshow" style effect where the first one slides up to reveal the second
[10:52:23] <ryanneufeld> but just showing the curtain effect for the page that's loading is better
[10:52:31] <digs> What the hay am I doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/3xMKa/
[10:52:35] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  I never thought of it that way...
[10:52:44] <ryanneufeld> when I click from the main to the last, I have to watch a bunch of them, it's kinda cool the first time
[10:52:47] <mikmu> Hey there, given this html: http://pastebin.com/sfnjH23W
[10:52:50] <ryanneufeld> but It's just annoying after
[10:52:50] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  the issue .. i am not entirely sure how to do that AND get the animations to trigger at the right point
[10:53:03] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: Ahhh
[10:53:04] <ryanneufeld> I see
[10:53:24] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  well.. the good thing is that this site isn't going to be navigated through a LOT.. it will basically be used by people looking for directions, menu, and for press inquiries
[10:53:37] <LindsayMac> but aside from that, its more of a form website than function.. if that makes sense
[10:53:47] <mikmu> Should I be able to do $(this).closest('form') on a click event for those two buttons?
[10:54:17] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: yeah, I suppose. I just think it's better UX
[10:54:24] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  agreed...
[10:54:25] <mikmu> The event triggers, but $(this).closest('form') doesn't return a form
[10:54:39] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  not sure if it's one of those things that I want to rework at this stage or just make work as it is..
[10:54:45] <ryanneufeld> like from photos to team
[10:54:48] <ryanneufeld> is 4 animations
[10:55:10] <ryanneufeld> team to about is another 4
[10:55:35] <Gho5t> mikmu: maybe it's because you're putting a form element between a <tr> and a <td>
[10:55:47] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  we actually have a tracking system in there so that we can track to see which pages people are going to and from where so I can reorder the pages if it shows it's needed
[10:55:52] <Gho5t> that's not valid html
[10:55:57] <Gho5t> wrap the table in your form
[10:56:17] <mikmu> Gho5t: I was thinking that.  In this case, I have a form for each row of my table
[10:56:19] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: Well, either way it's kinda cool
[10:56:33] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: it looks stellar
[10:56:47] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  thanks.. thanks very much. Maybe for round two I will rework the animations to work like a slideshow so it just cycles through one
[10:57:07] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  but in the meantime, i NEED to figure out how to disable clicks during this animation sequence
[10:57:10] <mikmu> Gho5t: I assume that I'll have to rework my output in this case to get valid html, since there would be no other way to validate
[10:57:27] <Gho5t> yeah not really sure how you would create a separate form for each tr
[10:57:39] <Gho5t> perhaps make a separate table for each instead
[10:57:42] <gnarf> Gho5t: by not using tables? :)
[10:57:42] <Gho5t> or better yet, use divs
[10:58:07] <fanthomas> http://jsfiddle.net/gCffR/    is there a way to make the button to submit the form?
[10:58:50] <anew__> http://pastebin.com/s69cP4qR anyone can help with this, it is not producing the url below, no get value
[10:58:54] <Teduardo> are there any input validation classes that know about common types of input like hostnames, etc?
[10:58:57] <anew__> the html is <option value=
[10:59:02] <jedimind> fanthomas, there is no button ?
[10:59:06] <anew__> just no idea why not gettig any values
[10:59:16] <fanthomas> jedimind: there is when you start typing "a"
[10:59:27] <jedimind> ah
[10:59:31] <jayant> hi, what am i doing wrong here?? http://jsfiddle.net/heaven0/Bc4Kg/
[11:03:19] <imachuchu> whats the best way of calling a function when an autocomplete box closes and an entry is not clicked on?
[11:03:50] <LordThumper> Is :radio selector being depreciated in 1.8?
[11:03:58] <gnarf> YAY! meeting time is over ;)
[11:04:27] <jayant> hi can anyone help me out?
[11:04:32] <jayant> http://jsfiddle.net/heaven0/Bc4Kg/
[11:04:38] <jayant> why doesnt it work?
[11:05:01] <jayant> do i need to add repositories with jsfidlle?
[11:05:28] <LindsayMac> jayant:  you mean resources?? like jquery and jqueryUI and such? yes
[11:05:40] <jayant> hmm maybe thats why
[11:05:56] <LindsayMac> jayant:  on the left side you can see there's the framework and resources boxes
[11:06:16] <jayant> yes i selected it from there
[11:06:24] <jayant> but it still does not work
[11:06:37] <LindsayMac> not sure.. did you set the onload / etc ?
[11:06:46] <jayant> mind taking a look at the code? yes
[11:07:12] <LindsayMac> jayant:  i probably cant help, but post it .. someone can
[11:07:22] <jayant> http://jsfiddle.net/heaven0/Bc4Kg/
[11:07:38] <jayant> well no one else is answering :(
[11:07:45] <jayant> its just a small code
[11:07:48] <jayant> newbie code
[11:07:54] <LindsayMac> jayant:  its lunch time...
[11:08:02] <LindsayMac> sometimes there's just no one here with the answer. It happens
[11:08:11] <jayant> ohh sorry, its 11:40 pm here
[11:08:50] <fanthomas> its 20:00 pm here and also no luck :-)
[11:09:33] <xnotte_> i have a form loaded into a inline shadowbox. But my validate does not work, it refreshes the page. The form id its hidden in the page. If i make it visible (#shadowbox-content { display:none; }) it works, but not inside shadowbox. http://jsfiddle.net/Hrptg/
[11:11:45] <imachuchu> jayant: will this work for you: http://jsfiddle.net/ChC8v/ ?
[11:12:41] <jayant> imachuchu: the hide function doesn't work
[11:12:46] <jayant> any idea why?
[11:13:26] <anew__> http://pastebin.com/s69cP4qR can anyone help me with this why it is not producing ?jobs= in the url ?
[11:14:45] <imachuchu> jayant: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ChC8v/1/ ?
[11:15:18] <jayant> ahh yes
[11:15:55] <imachuchu> jayant: (the '' around this weren't needed)
[11:16:45] <jayant> imachuchu: thanks :)
[11:17:22] <imachuchu> jayant: np
[11:19:04] <jayant> imachuchu: if i want to select all buttons, what should i select?
[11:19:21] <xnotte_> how can i make my form validate inside shadowbox ? it refreshes my page
[11:20:34] <imachuchu> jayant: http://api.jquery.com/button-selector/ ? Or a shared class and the $(".classNam") selector?
[11:22:45] <LindsayMac> afk
[11:22:57] <jayant> imachuhu: thanks again :)
[11:23:24] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: Y U NO code jams?
[11:23:25] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[11:23:33] <gnarf> ;)
[11:24:21] <ML74> how can i use $.ajax to post to a php script and display an error based on what the php script returns?

[11:25:45] <gnarf> :)
[11:30:12] <digs> ravenzz are you still around?
[11:34:48] <ScottG> I made a jsfiddle to demonstrate how making an element selectable seems to eliminate it from causing other elements to lose focus. How can I make it so that input loses focus? http://jsfiddle.net/ScottG489/mu5kQ/
[11:37:09] <jnhghy>  hi, I'm trying to give "onclick" atribute to a div and I'm having trouble with it; the address of the page is: http://www.mpa-shop.ro/shop/?p=22 and the div that should trigger the "onclick" is for the lens on the bottom of the image. anybody that would help?
[11:38:06] <gnarf> ScottG: it preventDefault()s probably
[11:38:09] <gnarf> ScottG: on the mousedown
[11:39:28] <gnarf> jnhghy: i will never help you add "onclick" to anything
[11:39:44] <jnhghy> why? is not good to do it?
[11:39:47] <gnarf> jnhghy: i would help you by telling you you should be selecting the element using jQuery and binding a click event
[11:39:53] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: Y U STALK ME

[11:40:07] <ryanneufeld> ?tableflip

[11:40:30] <gnarf> jnhghy: http://api.jquery.com/on
[11:40:44] <jnhghy> gnarf: this is what I was looking for, thank you
[11:43:00] <anew__> http://pastebin.com/s69cP4qR any help with this, r.sort().join(",") produces no data
[11:44:48] <gnarf> anew__: what is "r"?
[11:44:58] <jnhghy> gnarf: can I pm you?
[11:45:03] <gnarf> jnhghy: i'd prefer not
[11:45:09] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I CODE JAMZ NOWZ!! ʘ‿ʘ
[11:46:29] <ScottG> gnarf: So what would be a good way to resolve this?
[11:47:29] <jnhghy> gnarf: can you check this pastebin: http://pastebin.com/pgVV23va and tell me if you see an error (very short jquery)

[11:49:15] <gnarf> COOKIES!!!! 🍪🍪🍪🍪

[11:49:42] <ryanneufeld> how you do that?
[11:49:54] <ryanneufeld> (y)
[11:49:56] <digs> can someone help me get multiple dialogs to work on the same page please: http://jsfiddle.net/3xMKa/
[11:50:05] <grantg> 🍦
[11:50:11] <gnarf> The 🍰 is a lie
[11:50:22] <ryanneufeld> ha
[11:50:22] <jayant> ryanneufeld: that didnt help either
[11:50:38] <ryanneufeld> jayant: I dunno, I'm new here...
[11:50:59] <jayant> lol alrite thanks anyways :)
[11:51:07] <grantg> ಠ‿ಠ
[11:51:43] <gnarf> jnhghy: i see no obvious error, but why are you asking me, your browser should be telling you the error
[11:51:56] <gnarf> jnhghy: http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:52:08] <jayant> digs: put them into blocks and make them invisible, until they click on it?
[11:52:11] <grantg> ☹
[11:52:17] <anew__> gnarf i'm trying to figure out what r is , this is someoe elses code
[11:52:26] <anew__> problem is i dont see it anywhere
[11:52:28] <digs> jayant, here is a working variant...
[11:52:31] <gnarf> anew__: then don't work with the minified script
[11:52:37] <gnarf> anew__: get the one that has sane variable names
[11:52:50] <gnarf> anew__: and if they don't distribute source, don't use the product :)
[11:53:16] <digs> http://jsfiddle.net/pb44E/1/ - Notice, if you click button 1 and add some text and click save... then click button 2 it has the same text from button 1
[11:53:23] <anew__> even if it's minified, r should only be defined i one place shouldnt it ?
[11:53:47] <jayant> hmm
[11:53:51] <digs> That is the _wrong_ way to do it because each dialog has the same content, which is not what I want. Instead, I want each dialog to have its own content.
[11:54:11] <digs> So, the other fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3xMKa/ -- is my attempt to do just that.
[11:54:19] <digs> however, it doesn't work as you can see.
[11:54:36] <jayant> yes
[11:54:37] <gnarf> anew__: "r" will be pretty high in the chain, in an outer scope, but it could still be used more than once depending on how nested the code is
[11:55:03] <digs> but, I think it is something rather simple... like the location of the attachment of the dialog or the open... I am not sure.
[11:55:04] <jayant> digs: cant u use ajax to store it and then clear whenever the other link is clicked?
[11:55:09] <digs> no.
[11:55:21] <digs> because I need it to be available to edit during the lenght of the page view.
[11:55:45] <digs> I mean, I could do that with continuous ajax calls, but I would just rather not.
[11:56:02] <digs> continuous = more
[11:56:23] <gnarf> digs: a) I would suggest using data-target="#dialog-form0" instead of a class
[11:56:25] <digs> and there will be 'N' different dialogs.
[11:56:42] <grantg> ▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一
[11:56:45] <digs> gnarf okay.
[11:57:00] <gnarf> b) when you are doing a .find() for that dialog, you wont find it after the first dialog has been closed, because its already been made into a dialog
[11:57:13] <gnarf> so again, use .data() to store the "dialog" object for that ling
[11:57:36] <gnarf> dialogs get moved to be direct children of <body>
[11:57:52] <gnarf> so $(this).find() probably wont find it
[11:57:54] <digs> http://jsfiddle.net/3xMKa/1/ -- here is the update with data-target instead of class.
[11:58:05] <digs> I don't understand your b)
[11:59:49] <digs> gnarf ahhhh that makes sense what you are saying... "why" it is not working! -- As to the solution, I still do not understand.
[11:59:59] <Cesur> help me
[12:00:13] <digs> Cesur - refresh you screen.
[12:02:07] <gnarf> digs: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/3xMKa/2/
[12:02:28] <ScottG> gnarf: Hey thanks that seemed to have worked!
[12:02:40] <digs> gnarf you rock man.
[12:02:46] <digs> thank you.
[12:03:53] <gnarf> digs: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/3xMKa/4/
[12:03:58] <gnarf> also LindsayMac ^^^
[12:04:13] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  will look at it in a min. on a skype with a client
[12:04:16] <LindsayMac> thanks
[12:04:27] <gnarf> digs: btw, i hope you're not actually using jQuery 1.4.4 ;)
[12:04:33] <gnarf> upgrade to 1.7.2
[12:04:39] <gnarf> lots of new goodness
[12:04:45] <gnarf> and 1.8 should be out very soon
[12:04:47] <Mallenna> hola
[12:04:49] <digs> heh, It is drupal 7 man... I wish I could.
[12:04:56] <digs> soon enough... but for now I am stuck.
[12:05:09] <jayant> digs: once you save and click on it again it makes another box
[12:05:27] <gnarf> digs: then use .delegate( ":submit", "click" ) instead of .on()
[12:05:38] <gnarf> digs: 1.4.4 sucks
[12:05:53] <jayant> gnarf: whats the .delegate for seen it a lot around
[12:06:04] <LindsayMac> erm... you should be able to use any version of jquery you want with Drupal
[12:06:42] <digs> gnarf, okay. Thank you.
[12:07:20] <jayant> gnarf: sorry i asked :P
[12:10:33] <andrewhl> if I have some selector like $('.image') and I want to log to see which DOM objects it returns, what would I pass into console.log()?
[12:10:47] <LessSeen> the whole object if you want
[12:10:49] <johnkpaul> anew__: .get()
[12:10:52] <johnkpaul> ?get @ anew__
[12:11:00] <johnkpaul> ?get @andrewhl
[12:11:10] <johnkpaul> sorry anew__, didnt' mean to type your nick
[12:11:23] <andrewhl> i'll try that, thanks
[12:11:39] <gnarf> LindsayMac: its rough actually
[12:11:52] <gnarf> LindsayMac: most drupal modules depend on some backwards stuff in 1.4.4
[12:12:02] <LindsayMac> Ahhh stupid gnarf ...hahaha
[12:12:05] <LindsayMac> i disike drupal
[12:12:45] <imachuchu> I asked this a bit ago, but is there any easy way of firing a function when an autocomplete window closes and an entry was not selected?
[12:13:02] <digs> gnarf, what am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/3xMKa/6/
[12:13:50] <JeffreyLevesque> can someone tell me how i can append string to $(this)?
[12:13:51] <gnarf> digs: not using UI ;)
[12:13:52] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/3xMKa/7/
[12:14:11] <shmup> removeData isn't working for me, curious if there are any known reasons
[12:14:21] <gnarf> shmup: example?
[12:14:24] <shmup> on the same element i'm doing things such as removeClass, addClass, and removeData
[12:14:29] <imachuchu> or is there any way of getting what was selected from within the autocomplete:close event?
[12:14:44] <shmup> sure, <div data-repeat="4">   in js, .removeData('repeat')
[12:14:52] <gnarf> imachuchu: check the second argument to the event handler in a console.log
[12:14:58] <digs> gah. I see. - Well, on my server, this is not working. I get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined "
[12:15:37] <imachuchu> gnarf: I think I know what you mean, let me go test before I bug you any further
[12:15:40] <gnarf> shmup: .removeData() doesn't work on html defined data - because it removes it from the object and then when you read it again it grabs it back from the html
[12:15:57] <shmup> oh okay, i gotcha
[12:16:05] <gnarf> shmup: you have to do something like .data( "repeat", false )
[12:16:10] <gnarf> so that it stores something other than 4
[12:16:18] <shmup> now curious, if i also use jquery to add data, such as what you just did, say i added a new data
[12:16:25] <gnarf> or .removeAttr("data-repeat").removeData("repeat")
[12:16:28] <shmup> would i be able to see that in a tool like firebug or chromes built in ones
[12:16:46] <gnarf> shmup: it wont be defined on the DOM element if thats what you're asking
[12:16:49] <digs> oh. I missed a # in the data-target
[12:16:53] <shmup> because the html isn't reflecting it in there, it reflects changes like classes being added or removed, but not .data('count',3)
[12:16:59] <gnarf> shmup: if you are inspecting the element you can in console $($0).data() tho
[12:16:59] <zorph> JeffreyLevesque, did u get ur answer?
[12:17:01] <shmup> okay gnarf thanks, but it is there
[12:17:05] <shmup> good call thank you
[12:17:24] <gnarf> $0 = the currently selected element in the inspector
[12:17:29] <JeffreyLevesque> zorph: Not yet, but I think i'm going to figure it out pretty soon
[12:17:30] <gnarf> debugging pro tip^^^
[12:17:33] <shmup> OH wow gnarf
[12:17:37] <shmup> 0 knows to refer to that?
[12:17:49] <shmup> i mean the console does
[12:17:50] <gnarf> shmup: its part of the console spec for chrome
[12:17:51] <zorph> JeffreyLevesque, $(this).append("stuff here");
[12:17:58] <shmup> right, neat
[12:18:02] <gnarf> $0 = selected, $1 = the previous selected, etc...
[12:18:07] <gnarf> i forget how high it goes
[12:18:28] <digs> Nope, I still get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined "
[12:18:29] <ParanoidGal> Can anyone see why the lightbox element won't work (test link at top of page) http://www.valguin.com/redesign/forearm-dance-essentials/
[12:18:47] <tw2113> hi ParanoidGal
[12:18:49] <gnarf> digs: in the fiddle?
[12:18:53] <digs> no on my site.
[12:19:22] <gnarf> digs: so set your debugger to pause on uncaught exceptions, look at the stack trace and find out what line of code is causing that
[12:19:47] <tw2113> ParanoidGal saw this in console: Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString'
[12:20:08] <ParanoidGal> Hey tw2113 long time no speak!
[12:20:13] <JeffreyLevesque> thanks zorph!  I was trying to append things to the beginning of the string.  So i ended up doing this: $(this).text('stuff' + $(this).text())
[12:20:21] <ParanoidGal> tw2113: and in English the solution to that would be ;)
[12:20:29] <tw2113> dunno
[12:20:36] <ParanoidGal> lol
[12:20:39] <fanthomas> any jQuery UI expert here?
[12:20:57] <ParanoidGal> It feels like it's a conflict issue as it works on the backend just not on the page
[12:21:15] <zorph> JeffreyLevesque, then use $(this).prepend("stuff")
[12:21:15] <bot-t> (183 hours ago) <coldhead> tell zorph Gates says thanks for nothing
[12:21:21] <tw2113> i'm seeing 2 jQuery scripts liked
[12:21:23] <tw2113> linked*
[12:21:34] <Gates> eh?
[12:22:04] <JeffreyLevesque> thanks zorph, that saves some characters :)
[12:22:10] <tw2113> for ParanoidGal
[12:22:52] <tw2113> also not seeing any lightbox scripts :)
[12:22:54] <gnarf> fanthomas: just ask your question
[12:23:04] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[12:23:05] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[12:23:10] <digs> That error seems to be unrelated... but with this line of code "dialog = gift.find(gift.data("target"));" it borks. Meaning all the javascript stops loading after this.
[12:23:28] <gnarf> digs: i don't know if .data( "target" ) worked in 1.4.4
[12:23:37] <gnarf> try .attr( "data-target" ) instead?
[12:23:37] <fanthomas> http://jsfiddle.net/gCffR/   is there any way to make the buttons to submit the forms?
[12:23:40] <digs> okay.
[12:24:09] <jnhghy> how is it possible that a js file has no error when called with script src="" but gives error when called dinamicaly in a  "document.body.appendChild(script);"
[12:24:22] <ParanoidGal> tw2113: So it's not even calling Lightbox Plus?
[12:24:24] <gnarf> digs: also, check to see what .data( "target" ) is or what .attr( "data-target" ) is
[12:24:39] <gnarf> digs: sorry, but i kinda refuse on policy to try to support 1.4.4 anymore
[12:24:55] <tw2113> doesn't look like it
[12:25:01] <digs> gnarf, okay.
[12:25:02] <tw2113> from view-source and firebug
[12:25:04] <gnarf> digs: Thu Nov 11 19:04:53 2010 -0500
[12:28:21] <gnarf> digs: although that doesn't seem like that long ago, there have been so many features/bugs fixed since then...
[12:28:42] <digs> I understand.
[12:29:31] <digs> both .data( "target" ) and .attr( "data-target" ) are undefined.
[12:29:52] <gnarf> digs: are they defined on the <td>
[12:29:53] <gnarf> ?
[12:29:57] <digs> yes.
[12:29:57] <gnarf> or are you still using the class
[12:30:00] * digs double checks.
[12:30:18] <gnarf> digs: console.log( gift ) ?
[12:30:37] <digs> <td class="gift" data-target="#dialog-form0">
[12:30:46] <digs> let me do that. hold on.
[12:31:41] <digs> [<td class=?"gift">?Gift Message?</td>]
[12:31:50] <digs> -?
[12:31:53] <digs> that was irc
[12:31:56] <gnarf> digs: so there is one somewhere that doesn't have a target
[12:32:21] <digs> ohhh yes there is. it is the header that is not important. I will add a target to that one.
[12:32:22] <digs> :/
[12:33:13] <gnarf> digs: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/3xMKa/9/
[12:34:06] <gnarf> LindsayMac: btw - that fiddle example was just of using named functions and scoped variables to better organize jQuery code ;)
[12:34:28] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  ok.. still havent had a chance to look yet
[12:35:26] <digs> gnarf, that was a much more elegant solution than I was going to do!
[12:35:28] <digs> thanks again.
[12:35:37] <digs> And sorry for the 1.4.4 stuff :/
[12:36:53] <derekpioneer> anybody use uploadify and know if it has ie8 support?
[12:37:01] <ryanneufeld> derekpioneer: I have
[12:37:04] <ryanneufeld> and it should work fine
[12:37:08] <ryanneufeld> it's flash
[12:37:13] <derekpioneer> ryanneufeld: sweet
[12:37:17] <derekpioneer> you like it?
[12:37:20] <ryanneufeld> I do
[12:37:36] <ryanneufeld> there are others, but I've spent some time working with it
[12:37:44] <gnarf> i like plupload
[12:37:49] <ryanneufeld> I had to read the un-minified code to sort out what it's doing
[12:37:53] <ryanneufeld> and it had some nice callbacks
[12:38:13] <gnarf> none of them are great tho ;)
[12:39:03] <gnarf> i miss the short period of time when the gears API worked
[12:39:08] <ryanneufeld> yeah, they are all cludges on top of hacks
[12:39:24] <digs> gnarf one more question somewhat unrelated. This end goal of this gift message is to print it on a card and put it into a box to ship out to our customers clients. So, our customers fill out this "gift message" for us to print for them...
[12:39:29] <ryanneufeld> and the uploadify is a real pain if you don't want to use their buttons
[12:40:10] <gnarf> digs: and the textarea isnt inside the <form> anymore? :)
[12:40:13] <digs> We have limited space on the card and I am creating the sheet to print by generating a PDF of the gift message that is sized correctly for the gift cards... however, there are a limit on the number of lines and lenght of the lines that can be put on the card obviously.
[12:40:38] <sunbeam> any idea why .attr("disabled", "disabled"); doesn't work with radio checkbox fields?
[12:40:49] <gnarf> sunbeam: what version of jquery?
[12:40:52] <digs> so, what would be the best user input to control the length of lines and number of lines?
[12:41:03] <gnarf> sunbeam: you should be using .prop( "disabled", true ) in 1.6+
[12:41:03] <digs> one that works for both me and them.
[12:41:19] <sunbeam> gnarf: 1.7.1
[12:41:24] <gnarf> sunbeam: use .prop
[12:41:52] <gnarf> digs: probably some custom keyup handlers in a <textarea>
[12:41:58] <gnarf> and some simple regexp
[12:42:10] <digs> can I pm you gnarf ?
[12:42:31] <gnarf> i prefer not
[12:42:34] <digs> okay.
[12:43:35] <digs> How many hours would it take _you_ to accomplish that task?
[12:43:52] <digs> given a line lenth and number of lines max.
[12:43:55] <digs> length
[12:44:19] <ezio> two hundred and forty seven thousand six hundred and two minutes
[12:44:43] <gnarf> *shrug* 1-2 probably, but its not really on my list of things I need to do today either ;)
[12:44:53] <digs> What if I were to pay you up front your hourly rate to accomplish that task up front?
[12:45:08] <digs> - 2nd 'up front'
[12:45:17] <andrewhl> If I have a variable that stores a class name, and I want to do something like $('img.', + varname), can I?
[12:45:38] <gnarf> I'd say I have to work on some jQuery Infrastructure stuff today, and have only been helping out in #jquery between waiting for things to compile :)
[12:46:10] <digs> okay. Do you have a recommendation of someone that could. Because it would take me way too long to do that.
[12:46:16] <gnarf> digs: someone else lurking may be interested
[12:46:27] <digs> gnarf, okay.
[12:46:51] <gnarf> but this isn't usually a "hire-a-coder" type of room
[12:46:57] <digs> Yeah, I understand.
[12:47:09] <digs> That is why I hoping a fat hourly rate would entice you and I could be done!
[12:47:10] <digs> heh
[12:47:34] <gnarf> digs: eh - my fat hourly is being paid anyway for things that have a higher priority :)
[12:47:47] <digs> I understand.
[12:48:09] <ryanneufeld> I only accept payment in hookers and blow
[12:48:22] <ezio> so standard currency
[12:48:39] <ezio> world wide standard
[12:48:44] <ryanneufeld> It's the only one that you don't lose on the exchange
[12:49:20] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: not fish-hooks and 🐡?
[12:49:26] <digs> can you think of a less complex way to solve the same problem?
[12:49:44] <ryanneufeld> Give a man fire, and he's warm for a day
[12:49:49] <gnarf> digs: three <input type="text"> with a max length
[12:49:51] <digs> besides having multiple text lines
[12:49:57] <ryanneufeld> light him on fire and he'll be warm for the rest of his life
[12:50:16] <digs> Yeah, that is the solution most places use.
[12:50:24] <digs> I was hoping for something better.
[12:50:28] <gnarf> digs: and then hook keyup for enter/up/down on one line to bring you to the next/previous
[12:50:51] <digs> gotcha.
[12:50:58] <digs> Perhaps that will have to be a temporary solution.
[12:50:59] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you're enjoying those chars just a tad too much lol
[12:51:03] <gnarf> digs: is the number of characters static? like based on "em"s?
[12:51:12] <digs> yes.
[12:51:37] <gnarf> 🐱
[12:51:40] <ravenzz> digs #css-lance
[12:52:00] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i love that it still crashes socialhapy every time too
[12:52:03] <digs> It isn't exactly... but I have made it that way for simplicity. I have choosen the largest character in the font he choose and made that the line limit.
[12:52:11] <ryanneufeld> lol
[12:52:32] <gnarf> digs: so any good solution from a UX standpoint should support "wrapping" the text
[12:52:42] <gnarf> or manual "enter" presses
[12:52:47] <digs> I agree.
[12:53:05] <gabejacobs> Hey, do you know how to call a function if the back button is clicked on a page?
[12:53:23] <digs> Okay. I will keep on keepin on.
[12:53:24] <ejcweb> I'm trying to use $(document).error(), but the function isn't being called when there is an error, whereas window.onerror is being called. I thought they were almost the same thing?
[12:53:34] <digs> thanks for the info.
[12:53:59] <gnarf> gabejacobs: you don't - onbeforeunload will fire, but thats not what you want... if the "back" button is within your own site and you've been using pushState / hash based browsing you'll get a hashchange / popstate event
[12:54:30] <gnarf> ejcweb: they are not at all the same thing, window.onerror is kinda silly, and doesn't seem to conform to the DOM Spec for binding events
[12:54:40] <gnarf> you pretty much have to window.onerror = function(){};
[12:54:54] <gabejacobs> why isnt onbeforeunload what I want
[12:55:05] <gnarf> ?mdc onbeforeunload
[12:55:09] <gnarf> bah
[12:55:25] <Ak2i> Hi! I'm having trouble animating a slideshow with hover. To "slide" I fadeOut the old pic and fadeIn the new one. Now changing this at a very fast rate messes up the animation (queue). Anyone knows a solution for that? thanks!
[12:55:25] <gnarf> gabejacobs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[12:56:37] <gnarf> Ak2i: thats like a million dollar question, but look at .stop()
[12:57:09] <Ak2i> gnarf: I've been through various .stop ideas already, that completely destroys my animations
[12:58:34] <gnarf> Ak2i: well - you have to think very very carefully about what needs to happen to solve the issue then, using unqueued animations might help too, depending on the context
[12:58:48] <therealkoopa> Any thoughts on how it would be possible to test code that uses a FileReader an you need to pass it a file? I don't know if it's possible to construct the file object in a javascript test.
[12:59:17] <gnarf> therealkoopa: yeah, abstract the FileReader portion, and then write a test harness that overrides it
[12:59:43] <digs> ravenzz thansk for the channel
[13:00:33] <Ak2i> gnarf: I did try unqueued animations I think, but you're right - gotta rethink that tomorrow ^^ probably just thinking too complicated
[13:00:51] <anew__> shoky you around?
[13:01:27] <gnarf> Ak2i: its just a sticky coding scenario - it would be hell to write that behavior in a desktop application too :)
[13:01:52] <gnarf> Ak2i: write a flowchart of what events should do what
[13:01:55] <gnarf> etc
[13:02:04] <anew__> gnarf can i pm you ?
[13:02:10] <ML74> how can i use $.ajax to post to a php script and display an error based on what the php script returns?
[13:02:18] <gnarf> why is everyone trying to pm me today? :)
[13:02:27] <Ak2i> gnarf: it's so simple.. hover over a button - change the pic; hover over another to have a nother pic :D
[13:02:30] <anew__> lol
[13:02:45] <Ak2i> gnarf: but apply animations and bam, everythings broken xD
[13:02:48] <gnarf> Ak2i: but if one is already animating, what should happen to it as you change, etc
[13:03:04] <gnarf> does the old animation stop, then reverse direction? etc
[13:03:11] <Ak2i> oh my
[13:03:21] <Ak2i> kill it with fire before it lays eggs..
[13:03:43] <gnarf> anew__: i prefer to not deal with pms - if its a #jquery related quesiton, ask in channel
[13:03:52] <gnarf> if it needs privacy, feel free to pm

[13:09:52] <CodesStuff> cpalead/dollarade/leadbolt
[13:10:06] <shmup> gnarf: could it be data[type][index][id]
[13:10:07] <gnarf> shmup: thats not very dynamic, but okay....
[13:10:11] <gnarf> of course
[13:10:17] <gnarf> thats more dynamic
[13:10:18] <shmup> thats not the part i meant as dynamic, okay
[13:10:18] <gnarf> :)
[13:10:22] <shmup> right heh
[13:10:31] <shmup> was giving an example iteration i suppose ;p :P
[13:10:35] <shmup> thanks, wasnt working so i obv messed up.

[13:14:35] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: btw, did you notice that chrome 21 is stable now - getUserMedia/Stream support? :)
[13:14:51] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: nope, totally didn't notice that
[13:15:02] <ryanneufeld> unlike firefox, chrome updates without getting in my face
[13:15:23] <ryanneufeld> 🐓👊
[13:15:27] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: snaek.org/camera/
[13:16:02] <jedimind> gnarf, whats that using ?
[13:16:08] <gnarf> jedimind: getUserMedia
[13:16:17] <jedimind> right, which i happen to have enabled in chrome
[13:16:19] <jedimind> otherwise it woudlnt work
[13:16:23] <gnarf> jedimind: view-source:http://snaek.org/camera/
[13:16:27] <gnarf> jedimind: chrome 21 is stable
[13:16:31] <gnarf> no need to enable
[13:16:36] <gnarf> it asks for permission
[13:16:39] <gnarf> and works
[13:16:39] <gnarf> !
[13:16:47] <jedimind> nice
[13:16:59] <jedimind> now if only mobile devices would catch up
[13:17:08] <gnarf> jedimind: some day soon
[13:17:17] <jedimind> i have a $200k project hinging on getUserMedia being available on 30% of mobile market share by december
[13:17:20] <jedimind> but i dont have my hopes up
[13:18:23] <jedimind> so i may have to try to sell phonegap through again

[13:39:53] <gnarf> ScottG: a text editor

[13:40:16] <CodesStuff> Some people use Eclipse or Aptana Studio
[13:40:35] <ejcweb> I want to check if a certain website is up from my own web page. Is this possible using an AJAX request with an error handler? (the website I'm checking is not the website the script is loading on)
[13:40:43] <CodesStuff> Aptana is only slightly less bulky than Eclipse, but lacks some of the functionality
[13:40:56] <CodesStuff> ejcweb: proxy it
[13:41:20] <gnarf> CodesStuff: short of jshint integration, and f<tab> -> function($1) {\n\t$0\n} my editor environment is very lean
[13:41:29] <CodesStuff> Ajax -> backend (php,py,ror, etc) to fetch remove url -> check header response -> return via ajax to your site

[13:42:15] <CodesStuff> gnarf: I code on a sheet of toilet paper with a purple crayon. GOML
[13:42:37] <gnarf> CodesStuff: nice, I once wrote a program via copy con run.com
[13:43:04] <CodesStuff> I once risked a wet fart.
[13:43:12] <gnarf> CodesStuff: good to know
[13:43:12] <CodesStuff> I'm not in a relationship anymore.
[13:43:15] <ejcweb> CodesStuff: Ah ok, that won't quite work, since I want to check whether my own website is down, or the users internet connection (I'd use a check of Google as an example for that).
[13:43:26] <Back2Basics> What keywords should I be looking for to get a browser not to load everything (<img's>) until specifically requested?
[13:43:32] <CodesStuff> ejcweb: http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
[13:44:07] <gnarf> Back2Basics: if there is an <img> tag created, it loads the image
[13:44:21] <gnarf> Back2Basics: you have to defer creating the <img> until you want it
[13:44:27] <ejcweb> CodesStuff: Yep, I kind of want an API for that or something. I don't think it is possible.
[13:44:30] <gnarf> or at least setting the src...
[13:44:32] <CodesStuff> And ejcweb: Can you toss a javascript file on your server with a callback?
[13:44:49] <gnarf> ejcweb: jsonp
[13:45:01] <CodesStuff> Then just append the script to the DOM when you need to do the check. Run a typeof() or invoke the callback function manually
[13:45:14] <ejcweb> CodesStuff: To check is my own site is down? Yes. I can do that already. It's just the checking if Google is down which is tricky.
[13:45:30] <puchacz> hi, what's the "best" event listener for general val() changes? I tried keyup(), but - as expected - it does not work on mouse events on autocomplete.....
[13:45:41] <Back2Basics> gnarf: got it.
[13:45:45] <CodesStuff> ejcweb: Append a JS file from google api's
[13:45:51] <ScottG> gnarf: Off the top of my head I'd just like refactoring and preferablly some autocomplete
[13:45:58] <CodesStuff> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/
[13:46:26] <CodesStuff> Or hell, even append their asset spritesheet, and for the image's onerror event, tell the user their connection is shit
[13:46:36] <CodesStuff> There are literally SO many ways to do this.
[13:46:54] <gnarf> ScottG: i don't bother with "intellesense" or whatever you wanna call the tab completing api features - they are usually bad in javascript because of the typeless nature
[13:47:38] <ejcweb> Thanks CodesStuff!
[13:47:53] <CodesStuff> np. #swag
[13:52:43] <ScottG> gnarf: That's unfortunate. I've had similar problems in python as well.
[13:53:18] <puchacz> how do I listen to general content change of an input text field pls? from typing, pasting etc.
[13:53:35] <puchacz> mouse on autocomplete....
[13:54:18] <puchacz> change() is bad because it triggers on focus lost only, keyup() ignores mouse and autocomplete....
[13:55:11] <ryanneufeld> puchacz: you can bind to all of those events with the same callback function
[13:56:03] <puchacz> ryanneufeld: is there a comprehensive list of events that can cause val() to change?
[13:57:05] <gnarf> puchacz: .on( "change input keyup paste" )
[13:57:32] <puchacz> gnarf, ryanneufeld: thanks
[13:57:36] <gnarf> just be sure to debounce the function cuz you could get all of them fired for the same event
[13:57:52] <ryanneufeld> ?debouncing

[13:59:26] <ryanneufeld> puchacz: sure, go ahead
[13:59:33] <ryanneufeld> I don't mind
[14:01:04] <puchacz> ha, I see, this debounce/throttle plugin can do that
[14:01:08] <puchacz> is it a part of jquery now?
[14:02:18] <ryanneufeld> puchacz: nope
[14:04:50] <shmup> gnarf: do you know of any documentation on that $($90))
[14:05:19] <gnarf> puchacz: ben almans throttle is a pretty solid plugin - lately though I've been including underscore.js (or rather lodash) because it has a lot of other very useful things

[14:05:58] <gnarf> ;)
[14:06:01] <puchacz> thx
[14:06:07] <ejcweb> The jquery docs say I shouldn't use $(window).error. Why? What should I use instead to catch JS errors on my page?
[14:07:18] <shmup> ah thanks gnarf
[14:08:12] <gnarf> ejcweb: window.onerror - like i said earlier
[14:08:24] <puchacz> gnarf, ryanneufeld: even the list of events you guys recommended does not cover change from autocomplete :(
[14:08:51] <ejcweb> gnarf: And I should just use the jquery error() method to bind to the specific elements?
[14:09:11] <gnarf> ejcweb: "you pretty much have to window.onerror = function(){};" ... "window.onerror is kinda silly, and doesn't seem to conform to the DOM Spec for binding events"
[14:09:34] <gnarf> ejcweb: .error() is really only useful on <img> and <script> etc tags
[14:09:47] <ejcweb> gnarf: Ah, I see now. Thanks!
[14:16:48] <puchacz> gnarf, ryanneufeld: ok, they say autocompleteselect will work

[14:56:03] <imsky> unless your Like button is the shape and size of the fb like button, the user won't hit it
[14:56:05] <abletony84> yeah i know it's some ass ugly code no doubt
[14:56:15] <imsky> not the code, the solution's subpar
[14:56:24] <imsky> is your like button bigger than fb's like button?
[14:56:35] <imsky> the only way this is a good solution is if it's smaller or equal size
[14:57:15] <CodesStuff> Has anyone in here used Firebreath?
[14:57:49] <abletony84> imsky: yeah its about the same size, slightly smaller i guess
[14:57:59] <imsky> ok so you've accomplished..something

[15:10:28] <imsky> anyway, if it works for you, good job, but it's not nameswap worthy
[15:10:37] <imsky> you and i both know what would have qualified
[15:10:38] <jedimind> did you know that US army used to call out "lollapalooza" as a call in the woods in vietnam in an effort to catch anyone being disguised as soldiers?
[15:10:52] <jedimind> because the asian soldiers pretending to be US soldiers would pronounce it "rorraparooza"
[15:10:54] <jedimind> and then get shot instantly
[15:11:13] <ryanneufeld> that sounds made up
[15:11:19] <jedimind> oh if fucked it up, it was WW2, not vietname
[15:11:21] <jedimind> -e
[15:11:26] <jedimind> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#Notable_shibboleths
[15:11:28] <jedimind> ryanneufeld, ^
[15:11:42] <jedimind> During World War II, some United States soldiers in the Pacific theater used the word lollapalooza as a shibboleth to challenge unidentified persons, on the premise that Japanese people often pronounce the letter L as R; the word is also an American colloquialism that even a foreign person fairly well-versed in American English would probably mispronounce or be unfamiliar with.
[15:12:15] <ryanneufeld> quoting wikipedia doesn't strengthen any argument
[15:12:26] * jedimind shrugs
[15:12:26] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[15:12:29] * imsky lolololololololololololololol
[15:12:44] <abletony84> hrhr
[15:13:02] <scr3am> büüülll
[15:13:49] <ryanneufeld> For example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodward%27s_Building
[15:13:55] <ryanneufeld> my collegue lives there
[15:14:07] <ryanneufeld> and the paragraph "While the reconstruction and improvement of the Woodward's site had the side-effect of displacing some of Vancouver's sex worker population,[11] the prostitutes that remain in the area have largely been able to find new clients in the middle-class-populated market housing of the new buildings and serve to contradict predictions that these residents of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside would be entirely displaced.[12]"
[15:14:15] <ryanneufeld> is completly bull shit
[15:14:31] <ryanneufeld> I know people who have modified entries that say canada had nukes
[15:14:40] <ryanneufeld> afaik we never did
[15:15:04] <Lavitz> hi
[15:15:26] <CodesStuff> GO AWAY LAVITZ
[15:15:29] <CodesStuff> NOBODY LIKES YOU.
[15:15:32] <CodesStuff> j/k. hi
[15:15:46] <Lavitz> wow thats awfully rude
[15:15:59] <Lavitz> now i have to /wrist
[15:15:59] <CodesStuff> Don't be racist, sir. Thank you.
[15:16:53] <ryanneufeld> jesus, so much hate in here today...
[15:17:07] <BlueSherpa> is there a way to backport jQuery features like isPlainObject?  I'm stuck working with a CMS that uses jQuery 1.3.2. I can't upgrade it to 1.7.2, but I want to use a newer plugin that requires 1.4 features
[15:19:12] <imsky> bro
[15:19:17] <imsky> just use jquery to load new jquery
[15:19:21] <imsky> problem solved

[15:20:10] <BlueSherpa> thanks, I'll check it out =)
[15:21:29] <CodesStuff> jqueryception
[15:27:04] <ryanneufeld> BlueSherpa: what CMS is that?
[15:27:35] <BlueSherpa> ryanneufeld: a custom one by a company called xcarab.com
[15:28:19] <kavelot> is there an easy way to return an array of .attr('rel') of many elements?
[15:28:33] <ryanneufeld> ?selectors @ kavelot
[15:28:33] <bot-t> kavelot, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[15:28:48] <ryanneufeld> ?each() @kavelot
[15:28:48] <bot-t> kavelot, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:30:02] <kavelot> it's not exactly that
[15:30:06] <kavelot> maybe something more similar to map?
[15:31:02] <ryanneufeld> BlueSherpa: well, that's unfortunate. You can change templates no?
[15:31:21] <BlueSherpa> ryanneufeld: sadly, no
[15:31:28] <BlueSherpa> ryanneufeld: it's a shame that they are still using such an old version of jQuery
[15:32:57] <ryanneufeld> yeah, sure is
[15:39:15] <kavelot> any ideas why this work for ID, but not for REL? $('li').map(function() { return this.rel; });
[15:41:40] * imsky tears up
[15:44:48] <ryanneufeld> kavelot: you might want $(this).attr('rel')
[15:46:37] <noregret> if hover() is deprecated, should i use two seperate events for mouseenter/mouseleave ?
[15:46:48] <ryanneufeld> ?hover
[15:46:49] <bot-t> .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[15:47:21] <ryanneufeld> noregret: where does it say it's deprecated?
[15:47:36] <CodesStuff> $('#blah').hover(function(){/*over*/},function(){/*out*/});
[15:47:38] <CodesStuff> @noregret
[15:48:12] <noregret> ryanneufeld: in on() docs
[15:48:26] <noregret> i'm trying to do a hover() in the future, and the current hover() doesn't work
[15:48:30] <noregret> if you know what i mean...
[15:48:39] <CodesStuff> If it's deprecated, then why is it still functional? :\
[15:48:40] <ryanneufeld> Deprecated as of jQuery 1.8: The name "hover" used as a shorthand for the string "mouseenter mouseleave".
[15:48:44] <CodesStuff> oh
[15:48:52] <ryanneufeld> It attaches a single event handler for those two events, and the handler must examine event.type to determine whether the event is mouseenter or mouseleave. Do not confuse the "hover" pseudo-event-name with the .hover() method, which accepts one or two functions.
[15:48:57] <noregret> shall I use two .on()s for mouseenter/mouseleave ?
[15:48:59] <CodesStuff> yeah, so bind two events with .on()
[15:49:00] <CodesStuff> yeah
[15:49:05] <noregret> ok thanks
[15:49:09] <CodesStuff> \o/ swag
[15:49:15] <ryanneufeld> noregret: you're confusing the hover event
[15:49:23] <ryanneufeld> for the .hover() shortcut
[15:49:39] <ryanneufeld> Do not confuse the "hover" pseudo-event-name with the .hover() method, which accepts one or two functions.
[15:49:44] <ryanneufeld> right from the docs
[15:49:45] <ryanneufeld> :)
[15:49:55] <ryanneufeld> so, you're fine using .hover()
[15:50:10] <ryanneufeld> @noregret ^^^^
[15:50:35] <CodesStuff> I hate living near a park with a playground.
[15:50:39] <noregret> ryanneufeld: won't work in the future anyway
[15:50:44] <CodesStuff> I hear little kids screaming like they're injured or being kidnapped
[15:50:49] <ryanneufeld> noregret: why?
[15:50:51] <CodesStuff> turns out they just saw a fucking spider
[15:50:56] <CodesStuff> or something dumb
[15:51:33] <gnarf> CodesStuff: deprecated literally means "don't use it, but should still work"
[15:51:55] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: it was actually noregret
[15:52:00] <gnarf> noregret: .on({ mouseenter: fn, mouseout: fn })
[15:52:08] <ryanneufeld> noregret: What makes you think .hover() is bad?
[15:52:13] <noregret> ryanneufeld: coz it won't, i tried it, the event isn't triggered
[15:52:26] <gnarf> its actually sory
[15:52:27] <ryanneufeld> ?show @noregret
[15:52:28] <gnarf> mouseleave
[15:52:29] <CodesStuff> gnarf: Not if someone else controls it on the backend. Then "deprecated" means, "LOLUMAD?"

[15:53:52] <gnarf> CodesStuff: bot-t is a temp01 creation
[15:53:59] <BFranks> Damn.. why is jquery so confusing to me.. I want to use this example: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works#Adding_and_Removing_an_HTML_Class  ... to add the class "bar" to a <span> with the id "foo" ... so do I $("foo".span).addClass("bar"); ?!
[15:54:35] <gnarf> BFranks: CSS Selectors man... wtf is $("foo".span)
[15:54:49] <gnarf> BFranks: $("span#foo") ?
[15:54:59] <BFranks> gnarf: Hey I'm learning you can't ask me the questions.. ;)
[15:55:13] <gnarf> ?101
[15:55:14] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[15:55:15] <gnarf> ?learn
[15:55:15] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:55:28] <BFranks> But yeah that was my stumpling point.. how to select the item
[15:55:31] <gnarf> all three of those links are very useful to beginners
[15:55:50] <Adys> is there a way to prevent .load() from loading something into an element if the content-disposition header is attachment;*?
[15:55:57] <gnarf> BFranks: if you pass a css selector to jQuery it returns a collection of the elements that match the selector
[15:56:04] <BFranks> Apparently simple English/typing is also on the list of my problems.. Grrr.. end of day..

[16:00:29] <gnarf> ^^^^
[16:00:39] <gnarf> for an idea of how long bot-t has been unmaintained ;)
[16:00:56] <CodesStuff> heh
[16:01:16] <CodesStuff> Are you strictly a webdev?
[16:01:41] <gnarf> me? no
[16:02:23] <CodesStuff> Alright, now for the actual question: Aside from wxWidgets/QT, do you know of any better cross-platform widget library that has halfway decent event handlers?
[16:02:28] <gnarf> I do a lot of sysadmin stuff begrudgingly, and spend most of my time in library code anymore - server/client side web mostly, but some node based utilities
[16:02:35] <CodesStuff> Will be written in c/cpp
[16:02:43] <Adys> CodesStuff: whats wrong with Qt?
[16:03:09] <CodesStuff> The guy I'm coding with doesn't want to use it, and since he's better at C than me, I have to go with what he says.
[16:03:30] <gnarf> CodesStuff: i'm unaware, I don't do much cross-platform development
[16:03:40] <gnarf> and when I do - it almost never has a GUI
[16:03:53] <gnarf> command line for life!
[16:04:12] <Adys> CodesStuff: qt is c++, so if hes strictly c that would explain why he doesnt want to use it. If he's fine with c++, he should grow a pair and use Qt
[16:04:13] <CodesStuff> yeah, unfortunately this needs to look pretty
[16:04:43] <CodesStuff> Adys: He's pretty damn good with C,C++, and any bit of assembly he can get his hands on
[16:05:01] <Adys> Yeah well you're not going to find assembly gui toolkits
[16:05:08] <CodesStuff> I was just too lazy to add "++" when I said "better at C than me"
[16:05:19] <CodesStuff> I'm bad at communicating (or so I've been told)
[16:05:25] <Adys> CodesStuff: in that case, Qt
[16:05:53] <Adys> CodesStuff: it has amazing event handling, is extremely consistent and does everything you'll ever want it to do.
[16:06:46] <CodesStuff> Adys: Noted. I'll try to convince him to change his mind about it. Thanks for your input, btw.
[16:06:55] <CodesStuff> And to everyone else: I apologize for hijacking the topic of the channel.
[16:07:23] <Adys> CodesStuff: not like there was much else going on. fyi theres a #qt channel on freenode
[16:07:33] <gnarf> most decent cross-platform projects i've seen used Qt
[16:08:06] <Adys> theres no "decent" cross-platform toolkit other than qt really
[16:08:10] <CodesStuff> I should probably explain a little about what I'm doing
[16:08:24] <Adys> they all look horrible or feel horrible on at least on platform
[16:08:48] <CodesStuff> We're working on an Instagram desktop client. The closest thing to it is Carousel (for OSX), and Instagrille, which is just an HTML5 app in Poky or whatever
[16:09:26] <CodesStuff> So we need to be able to dynamically create image boxes and stuff, while having the GUI look decent enough for hipsters to use
[16:10:16] <CodesStuff> I've already created the webclient and done the mockup for the desktop one. I'd make the windows client in C# or VC .NET if I didn't want it decompiled in an instant lol
[16:11:47] <Adys> CodesStuff: you can use QtWebkit to keep the app in html, or the QtOpenGL module for real drawing, or QtQuick if you want a bit of both
[16:12:16] <CodesStuff> ..seriously?
[16:12:24] <CodesStuff> QT has webkit by default?
[16:12:31] <Adys> Qt has a webkit module
[16:12:45] <CodesStuff> That's tits, man.
[16:12:54] <CodesStuff> Er, I mean, "That is quite useful."
[16:13:53] <Adys> CodesStuff: http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/05/12/qt-modules-maturity-level-the-list/ - a somewhat up to date list of qt modules. most apps only use QtCore + QtGui (and sometimes QtNetworking)
[16:14:00] <Adys> er, QtNetwork
[16:14:38] <CodesStuff> "QHttp and QFtp
[16:14:38] <CodesStuff> State: Deprecated"
[16:14:47] <CodesStuff> oh, was replaced
[16:15:41] <CodesStuff> Adys: Thanks again, dude. I'm going to join #qt and see what's happening over there.
[16:15:49] <Adys> yw
[16:16:27] <CodesStuff> shoky: stop stalking me :P
[16:17:10] <shoky> not stalking, imitating
[16:17:24] <CodesStuff> I'm flattered
[16:17:30] <shoky> mostly wanted to see how many people there ;P
[16:17:50] <CodesStuff> I saw you join and was like, "HEY! I KNOW THAT GUY!"
[16:18:23] <shoky> irc is a small world
[16:18:55] <jaket> it's the world of tomorrow
[16:25:02] <sunbeam> I would like to have that when a sub menu item (of a main menu item) has class .current-item, that the parent class gets this aswell
[16:25:08] <sunbeam> Any idea how I can best do this?
[16:26:42] <codephobic> hi
[16:28:07] <codephobic> Anyone know how to get a google maps api geocode return for an address? I want to capture the latitude and longitude for an address, then use that to pull up a map inside a drop-down div.
[16:29:09] <CodesStuff> What's an example of the return?
[16:32:39] <codephobic> CodesStuff, was that in response to me?
[16:33:59] <codephobic> I've not really begun writing the code yet. I'm trying to get an idea of what exactly the steps are.
[16:34:04] <CodesStuff> Indeed it was, codephobic.
[16:34:12] <haizum> im trying to use var myvar = $('myelement').height();
[16:34:16] <haizum> but its returning null
[16:34:23] <CodesStuff> Well, can you give me a real world example, codephobic?
[16:34:29] <CodesStuff> ?demo haizum
[16:34:32] <haizum> though if i do alert ($('myelement').height());
[16:34:32] <bot-t> CodesStuff, Couldn't find "demo haizum" in jQuery Docs.
[16:34:35] <haizum> it returns a value
[16:34:40] <CodesStuff> oh
[16:34:42] <haizum> i think because the java is running before it can get the value
[16:34:47] <haizum> ?
[16:34:50] <CodesStuff> oh sec
[16:34:53] <CodesStuff> er
[16:34:56] <CodesStuff> can you make a fiddle for me
[16:34:57] <CodesStuff> real quick
[16:35:25] <haizum> ok
[16:35:34] <codephobic> CodesStuff, I have a list of addresses, with links. Whenever I click an address I need to query the api and return their lat and long coords.
[16:36:06] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/N5cjH/
[16:37:38] <CodesStuff> haizum: upload the image to imgur for me
[16:37:44] <CodesStuff> or can I just toss in anything
[16:37:47] <CodesStuff> as a placeholder
[16:38:26] <Abolfazl> There is a website that contains an html table. How do I use jquery to 'copy' the table onto my page but it only shows the rows that contain certain text
[16:38:57] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/N5cjH/1/
[16:39:00] <haizum> done
[16:39:08] <shoky> haizum: that code is fine
[16:39:34] <haizum> then how come when i do alert(headerHeight); i get null ?
[16:39:45] <shoky> did you look at your javascript console?
[16:39:59] <CodesStuff> haizum: you just need $(document).ready() - http://jsfiddle.net/N5cjH/2/
[16:40:16] <shoky> that wasn't the issue
[16:40:25] <CodesStuff> It works on my end
[16:40:35] <shoky> (jsfiddle already puts your shit in an onload by default)
[16:40:38] <CodesStuff> I'm able to get the height (200) just fine
[16:40:39] <CodesStuff> oh
[16:40:56] <shoky> the issue was that he didn't include jquery, otherwise his fiddle was fine
[16:41:11] <shoky> (except for it setting css of a missing element)
[16:41:18] <haizum> its jquery so $(function(){ works too
[16:42:01] <CodesStuff> Abolfazl: You will need to scrape it with a backend script (php/python) when queried with ajax. You could either parse out the rows you want with the backend script and return it to the frontend, or return everything and parse with JS
[16:42:20] <CodesStuff> shoky: I included jquery, and it didn't work for me when I tested it
[16:42:31] <shoky> CodesStuff: what didn't work?
[16:42:34] <haizum> for some reason when i wrap it in $(function(){ it says that my variable is undefined
[16:42:45] <haizum> i think it has something to do with the fact that i'm using codeignitor
[16:42:49] <CodesStuff> OH GOD.
[16:42:52] <haizum> well, muy dev team is
[16:43:04] <haizum> i've never used it b4
[16:43:38] <CodesStuff> you are forgiven, haizum.
[16:43:39] <Abolfazl> CodesStuff: Well aside from the scraping, how will I only show rows that have a certain cell in them
[16:43:46] <haizum> :P
[16:43:54] <CodesStuff> Abolfazl: Using logic :D
[16:44:05] <CodesStuff> Are you decent in php, abolfazl?
[16:44:10] <Abolfazl> CodesStuff: I have plenty of logic but I have never used jquery before
[16:44:21] <BFranks> I want to do some input validation.. but the form's elements are dynamic.. So I was going to do a 'for each' style approach by classes and validate them all with a single function.. but then I considered the 'what calls the function?' and realized I need each input element in the form to self check.. so I need some sort of syntax that says "if this class of element exists and is changed, make sure it's at least this long with no numbers
[16:44:21] <BFranks> if so change the class to something greener." ?
[16:44:29] <haizum> CodeStuff: so i'm correct, and that's what's causing the issue? how come i can't use $(function(){ in my .js ?
[16:44:36] <Abolfazl> I am excellent at modifying code but I am horrible at starting from scratch.
[16:44:53] <CodesStuff> haizum: It's probably calling it before jquery is loaded.
[16:45:00] <CodesStuff> Abolfazl: PM me real quick
[16:45:29] <ordinaryman09> hello guys, i'm trying to do a http request from local machine to a server via google chrome
[16:45:35] <haizum> codestuff: hmm well i have jquery <script> in my header before my .js
[16:45:59] <haizum> codestuff: and i'm using the jquery $( selector, so its obv. working
[16:46:44] <haizum> i've never heard of an issue where jquery isnt loading before the code
[16:46:52] <haizum> as long as you source it properly
[16:47:12] <shoky> haizum: it says what variable is undefined?
[16:47:26] <BFranks> ordinaryman09: Does the problem exist in FireFox? If so .. don't say google chrome
[16:48:18] <haizum> yes
[16:48:27] <haizum> alert (headerHeight);
[16:48:27] <haizum> ReferenceError: headerHeight is not defined
[16:48:41] <shoky> then it's not defined in the scope where you called alert(headerHeight)
[16:48:54] <shoky> variables declared in functions have local function scope
[16:49:20] <BFranks> haizum: alert() is handy, but it's annoying.. try console.log() as an alternative.. I think you'll like it.. :)
[16:50:14] <haizum> ok now its returning 0
[16:50:23] <shoky> "now"
[16:50:24] <haizum> within $(document).ready
[16:50:26] <shoky> as if we know what you did
[16:50:40] <haizum> i just added console.log(headerHeight);
[16:50:42] <shoky> as if we have any clue what your code looks like
[16:50:49] <shoky> properly explain the problem, and we can help
[16:50:51] <haizum> uh i provided jsfiddle
[16:50:52] <haizum> earlier
[16:50:56] <shoky> the fiddle works fine
[16:51:05] <shoky> (if you include jquery)
[16:51:09] <haizum> not over here
[16:51:18] <shoky> hm?
[16:51:18] <haizum> IM USING JQUERY
[16:51:30] <shoky> not in your fiddle
[16:51:36] <haizum> i've added it since
[16:51:44] <martixy> Hey
[16:51:55] <martixy> Why does this not work:
[16:51:55] <martixy> $(LargestImage).after(LargestImage);
[16:52:01] <martixy> The image dissapears
[16:52:27] <haizum> shoky: what do you mean "include" jquery?
[16:52:41] <shoky> haizum: also if you want image sizes, the images need to already be loaded, so you'd need e.g. $(window).load(function() { ... })
[16:53:01] <shoky> haizum: i meant include it in the jsfiddle, on the left top
[16:53:07] <haizum> ah
[16:53:18] <haizum> well i mentioned jquery earlier, i assumed you knew i was using it
[16:53:26] <haizum> that did it :)
[16:53:30] <haizum> window.load
[16:53:31] <shoky> obviously you're using jquery ..
[16:53:31] <haizum> thx!
[16:53:35] <shoky> np
[16:54:21] <BFranks> Aha! $().each(function()  ..
[16:54:26] <BFranks> That's what I needed
[16:54:47] <shoky> martixy: wtf do you want it to do? and why?
[16:55:22] <martixy> er... nvm, just misunderstood how it works. Clone was ok
[16:55:26] <shoky> ;p
[16:55:38] <martixy> Wanted to attach another copy of it at its end
[17:16:58] <haizum> can i use percentages when doing math calculations with jquery
[17:17:17] <haizum> i.e. 100 - 5% of 100 (not sure what syntax is
[17:18:07] <haizum> i guess that would be (100*0.95); ?
[17:19:02] <haizum> wait
[17:19:11] <haizum> i guess that would be (100*0.05); ?
[17:24:04] <jedimind> lol haizum
[17:36:47] <SCM> hi
[17:37:08] <SCM> im creating a series of select boxes for date, eg for day: $day      = $('<select class="date-day" name="date[day]"></select>');
[17:37:24] <SCM> later on i need to add/remove days, but it isn't working; $day.children(':last').remove();
[17:38:05] <SCM> i've confirmed that $day.children(:last).val() will print the correct values at the same place the above remove is happening, and they go down in the while loop, but the options in the select box dont change
[17:38:37] <SCM> any ideas?
[17:40:05] <Stephen> SCM: How are you adding the children to $day?
[17:40:56] <SCM> Stephen: it is done with $day.append()
[17:41:41] <Stephen> SCM: Try $day.children("option:last").remove()
[17:43:12] <SCM> Stephen: same result unfortunately
[17:44:07] <SCM> at the start, values are created with $('<option></option>').attr('value', k).text(k).appendTo($day);
[17:45:17] <SCM> i do emphasise though that $day.children(':last') returns the correct object, and they seem to be being removed because the value of the options go down in the loop, but it is not reflected visually
[17:45:50] <wingy> Looking at the Network tab in Chrome I see that jQuery is posting an OPTIONS request for every Ajax call I make. What is this for?
[17:52:42] <Jon47> wingy - can we see a screenshot?  I don't think that's a jquery thing
[17:54:12] <wingy> Jon47: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1256593/jquery-why-am-i-getting-an-options-request-insted-of-a-get-request
[17:54:22] <wingy> it's used for CORS?
[17:54:48] <wingy> I am actually making requests from another domain
[17:54:50] <wingy> and it works
[17:55:13] <wingy> i guess that is part of CORS .. i don't know if it's the browser or jQuery that makes the call though
[17:55:33] <wingy> must be jQuery since it says it's coming from jQuery.min.js
[17:55:50] <Jon47> wingy: .get is a jquery function so yeah
[17:56:35] <Jon47> it's doing a lot of things, among which is that it's making your cross-domain request work probably with jsonp?
[17:56:49] <wingy> im just making regular ajax calls
[17:56:51] <wingy> no jsonp
[17:57:10] <wingy> using another domain than my own .. and i see OPTIONS call in the Network tab
[17:57:13] <wingy> glad it works though
[18:03:26] <Jon47> wingy cross-domain policy states that you can't make asynchronous requests to alternate domains
[18:03:39] <Jon47> as a security precaution
[18:03:45] <wingy> it works though
[18:03:49] <wingy> it must be using CORS beneath
[18:03:54] <Jon47> jsonp is the established method of doing this
[18:03:55] <Jon47> yep
[18:04:25] <wingy> jQuery rocks
[18:10:18] <SCM> ah
[18:10:45] <SCM> with my earlier question of select options being remove()ed now working, could this possibly be due to jquery.ui.selectmenu ?
[18:11:33] <SCM> more specifically, how can i get it to update values
[18:12:15] <codephobic> in google maps api, is it possible to issue a geocode request and then populate a map object with the latitude and longitude from the geocoderesult object? and if so, how do I get the latlng to place in the mapOptions object?
[18:12:47] <codephobic> I want to create the map _after_ I have looked up the geocode for an address.
[18:13:10] <codephobic> so I won't initially have anything for latlng, until the address is converted to geocode.
[18:15:23] <SCM> nvm got it
[18:15:55] <SCM> had to run $("select").selectmenu("destroy").selectmenu({ style: "dropdown" });
[18:16:11] <SCM> except $day instead of $('select')
[18:22:16] <edotb> hey so
[18:22:40] <edotb> nm i should find an example, first.
[18:23:12] <coldhead> great work, edotb
[18:23:31] <edotb> suck ittt
[18:24:49] <coldhead> with gusto
[18:25:13] <edotb> http://www.purinaone.com/ has something similar in the <div class="cell"> which has the text "Why feed Purina ONE?"
[18:26:04] <edotb> there appears to be a mouse-over event, which adds the active class to the div, which causes the description div's size to increase
[18:26:38] <codephobic> is there a channel for google maps questions?
[18:27:26] <edotb> but every way that i can think of to achieve this produces poor results..
[18:27:48] <edotb> if i just bind the containing div to hover/mouseover/mouseleave, then the elements withing the description aren't bound, and hovering them causes the container to collapse
[18:28:09] <edotb> however, if i bind to them as well, then mouseleave and mouseenter are both called.
[18:29:14] <edotb> bueller?
[18:29:35] <coldhead> edotb: you can usually work around that by passing the event to the callback and testing it for certain conditions before animating
[18:30:20] <coldhead> so like $('whatever').mouseover(function (e) { if ( $(e).closest('whatever') ) return; } // ...
[18:30:30] <coldhead> sorry $(e.target) even
[18:31:37] <edotb> in that case, would i not have to bind to each child of the container, individually?
[18:31:58] <coldhead> no
[18:32:06] <coldhead> maybe it's easier if i just do you a demo
[18:32:24] <edotb> i can set one up for you, if you'd like
[18:38:19] <coldhead> edotb: http://jsfiddle.net/RbjvG/ that kind of thing
[18:41:01] <coldhead> or even http://jsfiddle.net/RbjvG/1/
[18:43:01] <edotb> hmm
[18:44:44] <Aratho> hey guys, i'm trying to figure out a way for my accordion to only display something as long as the other one isn't being displayed. can someone point me in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/JdB9n/
[18:49:04] <kcharle> hello all, new to jquery just had a quick question, if i wanted to execute some jquery code like a simple .toggle animation can i do that on a seperate .js page and have it work on my .html or does the code have to be in the .html
[18:50:03] <tw2113> you can put it in a linked .js file
[18:50:26] <kcharle> i tried this
[18:50:27] <kcharle> <script src="js/javascript.js"></script>
[18:50:35] <kcharle> then put the code in it, and it didnt work
[18:50:48] <kcharle> it works when i pput it in <script> codes on the .html page tho
[18:51:10] <tw2113> but the first way should work
[18:51:22] <tw2113> so something isn't right
[18:51:26] <kcharle> $("#button1").click(function () {       $("p").slideToggle("slow");     }); is the code i put in the .js file
[18:51:33] <coldhead> ?ready @ kcharle
[18:51:35] <bot-t> kcharle, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[18:51:47] <coldhead> need to wrap it in $(document).ready()
[18:52:02] <tw2113> yay coldhead to the rescue so i can take six
[18:53:00] <kcharle> perfect thank you gentleman, very appreciative
[18:53:27] <coldhead> YOU ARE WELCOME
[18:53:35] <uSMS> i serialized an array and stuck into a cookie with php, how can i get it out with jquery?
[18:54:29] <coldhead> use the cookie plugin
[18:54:32] <coldhead> to access it
[18:54:44] <coldhead> and use JSON.parse() to extract
[18:54:53] <coldhead> assuming you used json_encode() in PHP
[18:54:55] <coldhead> which you shoulda
[18:55:30] <uSMS> ok one sec let me do that.
[18:56:18] <uSMS> do I need to serialize it if I do json_encode?
[18:57:28] <coldhead> no
[18:57:28] <rainabba> FINALLY got the following working enough to get the result I want but there's one bit I don't fully understand, can't find an explanation for, and so I'm left wondering if my next step would be the best. http://jsbin.com/ubuyut/1/edit  Using the console.log() call I can obtain a reference to my ID and LABEL (SiteID, SiteDesc respectively) so I know I could assign those values anywhere, but
[18:57:28] <rainabba> right now the SiteID is being assigned to the textbox where I'm calling .autocomplete() I expect that has to do with the return { label:... value:... } call. Can anyone clarify what that bit is about and if I should use it to assign my ID to a hidden field, or if I should just write a couple lines to it it with the "item.Property" approach that works in the success: clause.
[18:57:51] <coldhead> json_encode($SOME_PHP_BULLSHIT)
[18:58:27] <uSMS> haha  i see your love for php
[18:58:34] <ieatplants> hi guys im new here :)
[18:59:23] <ieatplants> lol
[18:59:42] <rainabba> coldhead!!!
[18:59:46] <coldhead> rainabba: your question gives me a profound tiredness
[18:59:57] <rainabba> I have that effect on coldheads
[19:00:04] <uSMS> coldhead: ok when i do that the cookie is:a%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A1%3A%220%22%3B%7D
[19:00:05] <rainabba> ;) Missed me didn't ya?
[19:00:13] <uSMS> which after urldecode is a:1:{i:0;s:1:"0";}
[19:00:26] <uSMS> what am I doing wrong, thats not valid :(
[19:00:31] <coldhead> you shouldn't be doing urldecoding, uSMS
[19:00:48] <uSMS> i only do that so I can read it, i dont do it in the script
[19:00:56] <coldhead> $my_cookie = json_encode($SOME_NATIVE_PHP_TYPE); // set the cookie
[19:01:12] <uSMS> right
[19:01:13] <coldhead> then in js var thing = JSON.parse($.cookie('cookiename'))
[19:01:17] <ieatplants> does anyone know how to set an alert to pop on upon clicking an specific element, until another specific element is clicked? essentially what im trying to do is make it so one image link pops an alert and wont be clickable until a different image link is clicked.
[19:01:25] * rainabba has pity on those who inflict main on themselves; like people who choose to use PHP
[19:01:52] <ieatplants> then once the 2nd image link is clicked, the first one becomes clickable
[19:01:53] <rainabba> ieatplants: You can't because the alert is modal (blocks the UI)
[19:02:31] <rainabba> ieatplants: Now you COULD use a fake alert (like jquery UI or Telerik stuff) but that sounds like some odd behavior.
[19:02:53] <rainabba> Uninvited PMs are considered rude on Freenode btw :(
[19:03:23] <coldhead> ?nopm

[19:08:34] <uSMS> var playlist = JSON.parse($.cookie('playlist'));
[19:08:35] <uSMS> 		alert(playlist);
[19:09:50] <coldhead> what's all this array_keys / array_count_values bollocks?
[19:10:03] <uSMS> it finds duplicates and removes them basically.
[19:10:04] <coldhead> if you want to send the playlist why not just json_encode($playlist)
[19:10:09] <coldhead> oh gross
[19:10:14] <uSMS> because im trying to get rid of dups
[19:10:37] <coldhead> yes fine
[19:10:52] <coldhead> try a JSON lint on the value you extract from the cookie
[19:10:57] <coldhead> jsonlint.com
[19:11:00] <coldhead> make sure it's valid JSON
[19:12:50] <uSMS> well right now its not taking anything out
[19:12:56] <uSMS> its not valid json and idk why

[19:24:50] <vladikoff> leadev, used Xcode
[19:24:59] <rainabba> leadev: HTC EVO/Chrome
[19:25:30] <leadev> where is the simulator in xcode cannot find it
[19:25:31] <rainabba> Oh wait, those don't emulate it, they dominate it. My mistake ;P

[19:27:19] <ScottG> Does anyone know of any plugins for vim to assist with javascript code completion or at least refactoring?
[19:28:14] <Aratho> scottg: i'd look into sublime text 2
[19:28:30] <Aratho> scottg: it's not a plugin but I hear it's really dandy with javascript coding
[19:28:53] <ScottG> Aratho: I've been recommended that. Actually checking it out now. I'd by far prefer to use vim if I could, though.
[19:29:04] <coldhead> ScottG: if there's something decent for vim you can probably find it in this motherlode of vim config https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles/
[19:29:10] <Aratho> scottg: yeah i'm still a vi fanboy myself : P
[19:30:59] <leadev> @vladikoff thanks ! i found the iphone simulator in xcode
[19:31:07] <leadev> but cant find the ipad simulator
[19:31:09] <leadev> is there one /
[19:31:20] <vladikoff> leadev, yeah it's in there
[19:31:47] <ScottG> coldhead: Who's github is this?
[19:31:54] <coldhead> gf3's
[19:32:06] <coldhead> dude is obsessed with configuring vi
[19:32:18] <ScottG> Huh, never heard of him.
[19:32:28] <leadev> @vladikoff any idea where ?
[19:32:35] <Aratho> http://jsfiddle.net/JdB9n/2/ hey guys, can I get some help with this? I'm trying to figure out a way for only one accordion being visible at one time. Any ideas?
[19:33:13] <Aratho> coldhead : do you recommend his .files? I've just been using the standard. are his a godsend?
[19:34:31] <coldhead> Aratho: i pick and choose from them, some of them are too much for me
[19:34:42] <coldhead> but they're pretty great, guy has done his research
[19:34:53] <coldhead> and regular updates
[19:35:15] <coldhead> the zsh stuff is nice
[19:35:31] <coldhead> WHEN I LAY WITH YOU I WHISPERED SOMETHING YOU WILL HEAR
[19:36:25] <vladikoff> leadev, should be there , top left corner dropdown

[19:42:47] <seravitae> hi, if I have some images that start off hidden via jquery, are they still loaded by the browser or only when they are triggered to be shown?

[19:55:56] <diggitydane> i'm trying to initialize some checkboxes, but then when I click the checkbox I want the same thing to happen
[19:56:00] <diggitydane> https://gist.github.com/3300484
[19:56:32] <diggitydane> but I have the exact same code for each.  how can I make it all happen once on dom ready (for each) and then when someone clicks one
[19:57:34] <coldhead> $(':checkbox').bind('click', function () { do_stuff(); }).trigger('click');
[19:59:00] <diggitydane> great, thank you
[20:52:10] <maslo> hi guys could anyone help out with a .animate? what I currently have is in the header (while hovering services) on this page http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/, I'm wondering if there's any way I can achieve it without using opacity to hide it while it's not hovered the .animate is at http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/wp-content/themes/aem/js/function.js
[20:56:36] <Stephen> maslo: Url not found
[20:56:57] <maslo> odd
[20:56:58] <maslo> refresh
[20:57:02] <maslo> works fine for me
[20:57:17] <Stephen> ah, the comma
[20:57:21] <Stephen> nm
[20:57:24] <maslo> oops my bad
[20:57:36] <Stephen> So, which hover are we talking about?
[20:57:52] <maslo> hover Services in the header
[20:58:04] <maslo> the menu slides to the left and goes from opacity 0 to opacity 1
[20:58:13] <maslo> and it goes back to opacity 0 when you stop hovering it and it slides back
[20:58:21] <maslo> I'm wondering if there's a way to show it/ hide it without using opacity
[20:58:25] <Stephen> Ah, yes.
[20:58:56] <maslo> go on... :O
[20:59:05] <Stephen> jquery has a function which causes it to actually hide the element once opacity hits 0, one sec
[21:00:04] <Stephen> http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[21:00:19] <Stephen> From that pageL
[21:00:22] <Stephen> "The .fadeOut() method animates the opacity of the matched elements. Once the opacity reaches 0, the display style property is set to none, so the element no longer affects the layout of the page."
[21:00:35] <Stephen> Is this what you are looking for?
[21:01:03] <maslo> I knew about that function but I must of explained my issue wrong, I'm trying NOT to use any opacity while having the same style of menu (slides to left while hovered and slides back to right and hides once all the way to the right)
[21:01:25] <Stephen> Ah, you're looking for different transitions is all
[21:02:42] <maslo> hold on ill show you something
[21:05:14] <maslo> Stephen: ok refresh the page now, you'll see what I mean, this is the animation I want I'm just looking for a way to .hide() once the animation is over and to .show() when it starts
[21:05:25] <maslo> (clear your cache if it didn't change)
[21:05:35] <Stephen> Your best best is going to be to place your animated text inside of a div which is the size and location of it's final spot. Place the animation inside that div, set it'
[21:05:58] <Stephen> it's left to be just right of the rightmost border, and set the div to overflow:hidden
[21:06:47] <maslo> let me try hold on
[21:08:07] <Stephen> I hope that made sense
[21:08:15] <maslo> yeah refresh I think that should do it
[21:08:24] <maslo> I need to check on ie/chrome though to make sure it's ok and not showing
[21:10:00] <Stephen> I'd suggest putting the right edge of the appearing text just to the left of services, not going through it, but that's a personal opinion
[22:35:11] <scarlet_razor> hay.... :)
[22:35:44] <scarlet_razor> i need some guide on how to make an event if user click a datepicker... http://jsfiddle.net/Zrz9t/1151/
[22:36:42] <scarlet_razor> i found it on stackoverflow, i guess it got some a little trick to make add event work, such as giving GET parameter.. but dunno how to scipt it....
[22:42:22] <scarlet_razor> helllo people.....
[22:42:57] <scarlet_razor> sorry for asking such kiddies question...... but u know learning by doing is great :)
[22:48:22] <coldhead> its not an easy question, scarlet_razor
[22:48:29] <coldhead> i shy away from datepicker stuff
[22:48:34] <coldhead> that lib is gomblex
[22:49:26] <scarlet_razor> gomblex new vocab for me... :)
[22:54:13] <coldhead> this is working for me, scarlet_razor
[22:54:22] <coldhead> when i click on one of the selected dates i see an alert
[22:54:25] <coldhead> so what is your question?
[22:55:06] <scarlet_razor> yes... how to sent GET variable when i click any of unavailable date to a new href ?

[23:00:50] <scarlet_razor> my connection is very slow....
[23:01:05] <scarlet_razor> by the way ... thanq... i keep your link for futher test.... :)
[23:01:39] <coldhead> good luck buddy
[23:04:46] <rosieres> can somebody tell me what to do to prevent open only one link. If you hover throuh several times and click on one container its opened a couple of times . . . tried empty() on hover exit but ended in removing the header . . . -> http://jsfiddle.net/Sz4MJ/
[23:09:24] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[23:12:08] <rosieres> stop() for me ?
[23:13:46] <coldhead> yes
[23:17:54] <rosieres> coldhead: dont get it where andy why to set ! -> tried several points http://jsfiddle.net/Sz4MJ/1/
[23:20:57] <coldhead> forget stop
[23:21:01] <coldhead> i misunderstood the question
[23:21:02] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/Sz4MJ/4/
[23:21:06] <coldhead> that should do what you want
[23:21:31] <coldhead> oh wait
[23:21:32] <coldhead> now i see
[23:21:41] <coldhead> why are you binding a new click handler every time the user hovers?
[23:21:45] <coldhead> don't do that!
[23:21:49] <coldhead> bind it once
[23:22:00] <tw2113> don't do that shit, it makes coldhead cry himself to sleep at night
[23:22:19] <coldhead> or use unbind http://jsfiddle.net/Sz4MJ/5/
[23:22:28] <coldhead> i cry myself to sleep anyway
[23:22:31] <coldhead> for much better reasons
[23:22:45] <grantg> lik dis if u cri evr tiem
[23:23:03] <grantg> he said he love her 5eva, dat's moar den 4eva
[23:24:27] <tw2113> grantg :D
[23:24:51] <grantg> heh
[23:27:38] <rosieres> coldhead: is it enough to use one() or do I have to do more ?
[23:28:18] <Imeat> hi
[23:28:26] <coldhead> if one works for you then fine, do that
[23:28:45] <coldhead> i would do the click outside the hover() and avoid the problem completely
[23:28:50] <coldhead> but whatever floats your boats
[23:28:53] <coldhead> hi Imeat
[23:31:18] <rosieres> coldhead: makes sense . . . thank you
[23:32:43] <coldhead> damn strange a lot of the stuff they have on this internet
[23:33:19] <mfoxdogg|work> wheee!!! nudie run!!!
[23:54:58] <libin> can someone please give me a  few hints on how to do this - I have 6 got buttons, there is a div on top of those button, when I click a button the contents in that div should be removed and the corresponding content should be shown
[23:57:56] <flam_> what is the corresponding content?
[23:58:11] <tw2113> jsfiddle us, baby!
[23:58:21] <planet_en> yea baby..
[23:58:47] <libin> let the content be anything.. it does not matter
[23:59:24] <libin> for example >> If i click on Button A it should show a image A in the div, if i click button B , it should show button B
[23:59:49] <libin> it should show B*
