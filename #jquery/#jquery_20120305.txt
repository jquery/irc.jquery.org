[01:04:41] <aarjona> hello
[01:05:58] <jita> I am using soundmanager 2 plugin to play audio files. If i replacewith the division of the player with ajax, the player stops working, maybe the events disassociate themselves after the division replacing with ajax, how can i rescue that ?
[01:06:17] <aarjona> I'm looking for a way to extract from an array of objects an array of a certain property of those object
[01:06:30] <aarjona> basically I'm trying to feed .val() for a multiple select box
[01:06:58] <aarjona> is there a way other than creating an array and iterating the object array, assigning?
[01:07:17] <jita> http://dpaste.org/T1rpL/
[01:09:10] <Eviltwin> ?.map @ aarjona
[01:09:21] <Eviltwin> Ugh, http://api.jquery.com/map/
[01:09:31] <Xotix> i have ajax pic upload made with forms.jquery.js, i'd like to show a progress bar like thing while the ajax call is going. I've never done this. How can i do that?
[01:10:59] <aarjona> Eviltwin: that should do it, thank you
[01:14:58] <jita> Anybody knows why 'on' is not working in this case ? http://dpaste.org/BiJWO/ ?
[01:15:16] <jita> the bound event does not work after the division is replaced
[01:19:27] <poppiez> I'm using the "progress" event for XHR but firefox says it's deprecated. why is that?
[01:47:49] <Xotix> how cna i check if someone clicked cancel on a file input browser?
[01:50:06] <Larholm> check if the value changed
[01:50:53] <jmoney> does that even fire an event
[01:51:23] <Larholm> what, onchange? sure
[01:51:35] <Larholm> it don't mean that the user clicked cancel though
[01:51:39] <Xotix> change() just if someone choosed something
[01:52:27] <Larholm> and if it doesn't fire, you know they didn't pick anything
[01:53:03] <Xotix> How should i do that?
[01:53:29] <Larholm> on click, show a message that they have to pick something, hide message onchange
[01:53:37] <Larholm> why do you even care?
[01:53:47] <Xotix> I can't  check for it not getting fired.
[01:55:10] <Xotix> because i have an img ajax upload triggered by clicking on an img and auto open the input. Ie of course doesn't allow that and know i have to show the hidden form so he can click on the button himselfâ€¦after he pressed cancel or ok, i want to hide it again. But i never know, when he clicked cancel using change();
[01:58:34] <jarr0dsz> good morning all!
[01:58:47] <jarr0dsz> im working on a small function thats already done but need to add some variable to it
[01:58:48] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/J7ghn/
[01:59:07] <jarr0dsz> im trying to have a variable i can send with the ajax, namely the match_yes and match_no
[01:59:29] <jarr0dsz> what would be good way to set a variable on the toggle method somehow
[02:01:22] <Algo> http://jsfiddle.net/e8XJh/ first item always undefined...it really shouldn't be doing that...because its telling me it can't find something...but I print it out and it's there... I've run out of ideas... I can't squash this bug
[02:03:57] <Ghan> is there a simple way to check if a directory content changes and if it does reload the page
[02:04:12] <Ghan> been googling for a while now, but can't seem to find it
[02:05:53] <K3|Chris|Work> anyone spotted a jQ example of "stepping fluid layout" ? say I have 200px wide divs floated left in a 100% wide page, I want them to go edge to edge, and show one more per row if I make the browser 200px wider, one less if I make it 200px larger
[02:07:04] <K3|Chris|Work> aka a minimum size of 200px, maximum of 200 + (browser width % 200) / (browser width / 200)
[02:13:02] <jarr0dsz> hmm would it be possible to pass a variable true     $('#container_session').load('/my/url/myvar'); somehow?
[02:13:49] <Xotix> jarr0dsz, what are you trying to do? Maybe you can use trigger() or .data()?
[02:14:14] <jarr0dsz> Xotix: im loading a page in with ajax from another page
[02:14:36] <jarr0dsz> therefore im loosing url params i normally use inside sql queries
[02:14:52] <jarr0dsz> so im now need to pass a ID inside that js onload call
[02:15:20] <jarr0dsz> i hava a show.html where i call that on.load line perhaps there are other options to pass data to the onload function?
[02:16:15] <jarr0dsz>     $('#container_session').load('/groups/#{@group.id}/url');  --> /groups/1/url
[02:16:30] <jarr0dsz> now i need to get that 1 value inside the loaded /groups/1/url content
[02:19:49] <nFFF> jarr0dsz, do you want to pass #{@group.id} literally
[02:20:01] <jarr0dsz> ok got it fixed i used my dev framework to pass the variable in
[02:20:14] <jarr0dsz> better then using  js more solid
[02:20:18] <nFFF> or is it a var that returns a value?
[02:20:30] <jarr0dsz> its just a ID i use inside a query
[02:20:55] <jarr0dsz> sorry about that asked to soon it was easily solved using not js but code ;p
[02:21:57] <Xotix> How can i show somethign while an ajax call is "working".
[02:22:30] <Cork> Xotix: show it before you do the call
[02:22:33] <Cork> and hide it on complete
[02:23:24] <Xotix> Cork, i thought that as well but didn't think it's very nice. But okay.
[02:23:54] <Cork> Xotix: why not?
[02:26:35] <Xotix> Cork, just felt like that.  Thought there's something already made. What if the suer stops the call, if it gets an error etc.
[02:27:10] <Cork> Xotix: $.ajax => success/error => complete
[02:27:17] <Cork> you always end up in complete
[02:28:07] <Xotix> Cork yes i do, Thanks.
[02:28:49] <imc> i'm puzzled about the .after() function. I have someContent1, someContent2 and someContent3 (jquery object, containing <tr/>'s). I would like to concatenate the three contents. Nom i'm doing $fullContent = someContent1.after(someContent2, someContent3); but I end up with $fullContent == someContent1
[02:29:13] <imc> each content is rendered right if taken alone.
[02:29:35] <imc> any idea?
[02:31:04] <Clex> imc: you'll have <content1><content2><content3></content3></content2></content1>.
[02:31:14] <Clex> So yes, content1 == fullContent.
[02:31:15] <imc> why is that Clex ?
[02:31:21] <Cork> imc: that is expected
[02:31:28] <Cork> you prob want .add instead
[02:31:42] <imc> Cork: so what's the difference between after and append then?
[02:31:53] <imc> (thanks anyway!)
[02:31:54] <Cork> append adds to the end of the parent
[02:31:59] <Cork> after adds after the parent
[02:32:04] <imc> oh
[02:32:13] <imc> append adds to the end of the parent's children
[02:32:25] <Cork> uh... no
[02:32:39] <Cork> <parent>...<appends here/></parent>
[02:32:43] <imc> indeed
[02:32:51] <imc> after the last parent's child
[02:32:51] <Cork> <parent>...</parent><after here/>
[02:33:07] <imc> i want the </parent><after here/> behaviour
[02:33:11] <imc> is it add or after ?
[02:33:18] <Cork> its after
[02:33:27] <Cork> but it won't be part of the selector
[02:33:34] <imc> i don't have selectors
[02:33:37] <imc> i have jquery objects
[02:33:53] <Cork> jquery objects is normally refered to as a selector
[02:34:01] <Cork> after just modifies the dom
[02:34:11] <imc> well i build jquery objects before inserting in the dom
[02:34:17] <Cork> after returns the same set of objects you ran it on
[02:34:45] <jdiderik> I have a question on $.Callbacks: I added several functions to the queue, one of them animates a div. How can I prevent the Callbacks to continue before the animation is finished?
[02:34:46] <Cork> so you need both after and add if you want fullContent to include them
[02:35:07] <imc> Cork: ?!
[02:35:28] <jdiderik> It now seems to continue to the next function...
[02:35:42] <imc> ok, so i have $('<tr id="A"/>').after($('<tr id="2"/>'), $('<tr id="3"/>'))
[02:35:59] <imc> this function returns what? just <tr id="A"/> ?
[02:36:02] <imc> re Cork
[02:36:06] <imc> ok, so i have $('<tr id="A"/>').after($('<tr id="2"/>'), $('<tr id="3"/>'))
[02:36:17] <imc> this returns just <tr id="A"/> ?
[02:36:35] <Cork> yes
[02:36:45] <imc> ok, so the only thing is side-effects on DOM
[02:36:53] <imc> while .add() does return a list
[02:36:55] <Cork> not side effect
[02:37:22] <imc> well if X <==> X.after(whatever) then after does only side-effect or does nothing
[02:37:29] <imc> imho
[02:37:31] <Cork> after is meant to modify the dom by adding the second element after the first
[02:37:48] <imc> and return the same object it was called upon
[02:37:52] <imc> i.e. only side-effect
[02:38:07] <imc> now i get it. thanks
[02:38:29] <Cork> not sure how you can call what the function is meant for a side effect though...
[02:38:49] <imc> what?
[02:39:22] <Cork> $('.list:last').after('<li class="list">new list</li>')
[02:39:34] <Cork> run that a few times and you get what the function is meant for
[02:39:37] <imc> perfectly works, after DOM manipulation, add object manipulation
[02:40:02] <imc> i'm interested in after()'s return, not in after side-effects
[02:40:15] <Cork> none of the dom manipulation functions is meant to modify the jquery collection
[02:40:16] <imc> after() returns this, add returns this + arguments
[02:40:29] <Cork> same with append, html, prepend and so on
[02:40:30] <imc> yeah, i'm getting used to that now. thanks again
[02:40:41] <imc> well append do returns a modified jquery object
[02:40:45] <imc> event if it's detached
[02:40:47] <Cork> no
[02:40:48] <imc> *even
[02:40:53] <imc> i can assure you
[02:40:56] <Cork> you can run a select on the jquery object
[02:41:00] <imc> i'm using it all the time
[02:41:02] <Cork> and you will find the appended elements
[02:41:08] <Cork> thats something completly different
[02:41:25] <imc> well, it works with detached object, returns what i am expecting...
[02:41:26] <Cork> the jquery object don't be modified cause of an append
[02:41:32] <Cork> *wont be
[02:41:36] <imc> i don't care
[02:41:45] <imc> i want the result, not the original object
[02:41:55] <Cork> well then use .add
[02:41:59] <Cork> thats what its for
[02:42:22] <imc> append behave like add in that sense, it returns the object with appended arguments
[02:42:30] <imc> so it's not a side-effect-only function
[02:42:33] <imc> like after is
[02:48:51] <cpaq> if I am in the middle of jquery function, how would go about switching to php and then back.  See, my javascript needs to to know how many files are in a directory which is easy in php I think
[02:54:16] <bla> cpaq, execute an ajax query to the server.
[02:54:28] <nFFF> cpaq, <?php ?>
[02:54:43] <nFFF> and just json_encode() your PHP variable
[02:54:50] <cpaq> bla, thx
[02:55:03] <cpaq> nFFF, thx
[02:55:06] <bla> cpaq, what nFFF says is legit too, assuming you want this information at the point of generating JS code.
[02:55:07] <Algo> http://jsfiddle.net/e8XJh/ first item always undefined...it really shouldn't be doing that...because its telling me it can't find something...but I print it out and it's there... I've run out of ideas... could anyone please help?
[02:57:54] <nFFF> First item
[02:57:58] <nFFF> ..
[02:58:02] <nFFF> Elaborate
[02:59:13] <nFFF> Nothing on that fiddle works for me :|
[02:59:31] <nFFF> Ok first you need to include jQuery on the left drop down menu
[02:59:58] <softmanpetro> hi ! I play with fancybox2 and added a 'onStart' : function(){ console.log('onstart'); }, but I never see is logged in firebug ever ! Any ideea pleae, why ?
[03:11:35] <Larholm> cpaq, http://xkr.us/js/clientserver
[03:13:10] <wctaiwan> http://wctaiwan.com/test.html can someone help me fix the 'jump'?
[03:13:34] <wctaiwan> (it happens in Firefox 10. Not sure about other browsers)
[03:15:07] <pbjorklund> Whats a good point to start debugging at when $("#page").click() works but clicking the element in the browser doesn't?
[03:15:32] <pbjorklund> *calling $(â€¦ in the chrome js console
[03:35:11] <Shambat> wctaiwan: its cause you go from auto margin ---> -11px ---> -700px
[03:35:22] <Shambat> *-1px sry
[03:36:04] <wctaiwan> yeah I see what it's doing. I'm debugging it and "$("#header").css('marginLeft');" is returning 0px
[03:36:17] <wctaiwan> when I call it at the beginning of the click() method.
[03:36:52] <Shambat> wctaiwan: could you try finding the actual margin-left, and begin there and animate?
[03:36:57] <wctaiwan> how should I fix it? Use jquery to calculate window size and reset the margin to a non-auto value beforehand? It seems like a dirty hack though.
[03:37:17] <wctaiwan> (sorry, total noob here. I'm not sure how people would handle it otherwise :/)
[03:38:54] <Shambat> yeah I'm not sure of the best jQuery way
[03:39:10] <wctaiwan> I suppose I'll just try what I said then.
[03:39:21] <Shambat> yeah try and see
[03:39:29] <Shambat> doesnt seem too dirty of a hack
[03:43:07] <muzone> sj26: got a sec?
[03:46:06] <wctaiwan> Shambat: appears to work, though my head is screaming "there has got to be a better way than all this hard coding" :P
[03:47:25] <Shambat> wctaiwan: maybe look at .offset() and .position() ?
[03:48:11] <wctaiwan> I will, thanks.
[03:57:34] <wctaiwan> Shambat: one more question, if I may... is "$('#header').css('marginLeft', $('#header').offset().left);" guaranteed to work? i.e. is it guaranteed that it will first run .offset() before running .css()?
[03:57:45] <wctaiwan> or should I store the value of offset first
[03:58:26] <quicksilver> yes, it is guaranteed.
[03:58:36] <quicksilver> There are no tricks in the evaluation order of javascript
[03:58:45] <quicksilver> it is standard innermost first.
[03:58:46] <wctaiwan> Thank you.
[04:01:34] <xec> wctaiwan: you could fix it with a container and animating positioning rather than margin
[04:01:37] <xec> wctaiwan: http://jsfiddle.net/9RWJv/3/
[04:03:10] <aqeel> hi room
[04:03:30] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[04:04:00] <aqeel> submenu is asking for double click after clicking li under submenu
[04:04:39] <LukeNukem> Um, one facebook when you have keep the mouse on image for a few seconds a bar comes and says something
[04:04:40] <LukeNukem> how is this done?
[04:05:33] <n4than> LukeNukem, onHover animate ?
[04:07:39] <wctaiwan> xec: that doesn't quite do it though. It just moves the div 700 px to the left, instead of off-screen, which is what I was aiming for.
[04:07:47] <LukeNukem> n4than, okay but im wondering how does it get the position of the element correctly?
[04:07:48] <LukeNukem> o.o
[04:07:49] <wctaiwan> I think what I have now is adequate at least for the time being :/
[04:08:37] <aqeel> any can look into my issue....
[04:08:49] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[04:08:59] <aqeel> submenu is asking for double click after clicking li under submenu
[04:09:39] <aqeel> click 1 in main menu follow by the one link in submenu
[04:10:18] <xec> wctaiwan: i just copypasted your value, you had 700 set
[04:10:19] <n4than> LukeNukem, url please ?
[04:10:42] <wctaiwan> xec: right but without the wrapper, the margin would be relative to the document
[04:11:07] <wctaiwan> so margin = -700 would set the left margin to -700px relative to the left edge of the browser
[04:11:20] <xec> wctaiwan: and is the reason behind the jump
[04:12:02] <wctaiwan> I think the jump is caused by jquery not being able to figure out that it should animate from whatever offset auto results in, instead of the 0px it seems to substitute automatically.
[04:12:39] <wctaiwan> the way I do it seems to have fixed it (I called offset() to calculate the position explicitly and then set the left margin to that before animating)
[04:14:28] <PressedWeb> Hey guys, I've got an h1 element and a sibling p element. I'm trying to get the p element to equal the size of the h1 element, but it seemingly works at random.
[04:14:39] <PressedWeb> When I load the page for the first time, it doesn't work. When I refresh, it does.
[04:14:56] <aqeel> ??jsfiddle
[04:14:59] <PressedWeb> k
[04:15:50] <xec> wctaiwan: i just think you might be getting yourself into trouble in the future - lets say you nest this content inside something later on - with its own margin or padding etc
[04:16:10] <cpaq> how do you make your javascript wait for the $.ajax() trasaction to complete
[04:16:43] <xec> wctaiwan: if its left margin is set to the offset its going to push it right
[04:17:33] <wctaiwan> I see what you're saying but :/ I think I'll stick with it for now. The current project I have will end up having a lot of animations, but I don't foresee many changes to it (it's a one-off thing, a demo for something I need to do). Ultimately I need the functionality more than I need maintainability in the future.
[04:18:14] <xec> wctaiwan: ok, i see

[04:32:08] <K3|Chris|Work> anyone spotted a jQ example of "stepping fluid layout" ? say I have 200px wide divs floated left in a 100% wide page, I want them to go edge to edge, and show one more per row if I make the browser 200px wider, one less if I make it 200px larger
[04:32:12] <K3|Chris|Work> aka a minimum size of 200px, maximum of 200 + (browser width % 200) / (browser width / 200)
[04:32:52] <xec> aqeel, PressedWeb: well, i get the same result in ff on windows and ff on mac
[04:33:11] <xec> click on title moves the title to the right and places caption in its place

[04:40:12] <PressedWeb> Ok, demo is updated with cleaner css/js
[04:40:12] <xec> PressedWeb: i messed with the css a bit http://jsfiddle.net/MR9bR/1/
[04:41:50] <PressedWeb> Thanks xec, but it doesn't work on my live demo
[04:42:14] <PressedWeb> jsfiddle doesn't seem to have a problem with this at all, just the actual site. :\
[04:42:43] <xec> PressedWeb: i had the issue of misplaced header in jsfiddle too
[04:42:59] <PressedWeb> It's not misplaced anymore: http://www.electcherylspriggs.com/sandbox/
[04:43:14] <PressedWeb> Functions as expected, just screwy padding on the .caption p

[04:43:38] <jarr0dsz> how could i add a spinning image until the load is completed?

[04:51:20] <Lichurec> Hi there ;)

[04:51:50] <LordThumper> Hey, is https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js down for anyone else?
[04:51:55] <Larholm> AdvoWork, jQuery has an internal datastore that's populated on the first call
[04:52:06] <Larholm> just change .attr to .data
[04:52:08] <Cork> LordThumper: wfm
[04:52:46] <LordThumper> Cork: ok ty

[04:54:24] <xec> artiintell: also, include the plugin and choose jQuery under framework
[04:56:45] <D4> I have a question about jQuery.post(), I'm posting to "self" and I'm curious about how I'd use post() to send my data to self, what would I set the 'url' to be? The file it's being run from or is there a default using the file run as standard or?
[04:57:40] <NodeX> the file that runs it
[04:58:04] <cpaq> Hi, I have some images appended to dom as so: $('#apnd-l').append("<p class=>"+ j + "</p> <img class='next4' id='" + j + "' src='shrinks/" + tint2+ "/" + j + "/1.jpg' alt='"+ j +"' width='46' height='70' />", I want to make em clickable, so I tried $('img.next4').live('click', function() { ..., &  $('#apnd-l > img').live('click', function() { ..., but neither works, any ideas?
[04:58:54] <NodeX> what jquery version are you using?
[04:59:18] <D4> NodeX » There's no var or something to use? Meaning, how does it look at the URL specified? Is it relative to the path the .post() is run from? Say I'd be running jQuery.post() in a.php, would I simply do url: a.php or would I have to specify the absolute path?
[04:59:21] <arcangelh> Hi, I'm new
[04:59:37] <arcangelh> would like to know how to make ui style is applied so as not to see a jump in Interfas
[04:59:44] <NodeX> the abs path relative to your web root
[05:00:00] <NodeX> as in /a.php if it's http://blah.com/a.php
[05:00:03] <Lichurec> cpaq $('#apnd-l').on('click', '.next4', function(){} ) should work
[05:00:06] <D4> Thank you for clarifying NodeX - I'll experiment with it!
[05:00:17] <cpaq> Never mind, it seems so be a scope issue
[05:00:26] <NodeX> if you're on 1.7.1 !
[05:00:34] <NodeX> or 1.7x sorry
[05:00:50] <cpaq> Lichurec, thx
[05:02:04] <AdvoWork> Larholm, ive set it with data() but same problem :S
[05:02:23] <knickabocka> is there an slideshow with a mosiac plugin effect? i try to find one over google. no results..
[05:02:41] <K3|Chris|Work> anyone knows why my page doesn't do anything inside $(document).ready(function() { } or $(window).resize(function() { } anymore? :<
[05:03:03] <Shambat> knickabocka: do you mean liek a tiled transition?
[05:03:05] <NodeX> K3 .. an error probably!
[05:03:16] <K3|Chris|Work> works outside of them, no errors in firebug
[05:03:32] <NodeX> are you rendering with an ajax call or anything ?
[05:03:42] <K3|Chris|Work> no
[05:04:00] <NodeX> .ready would only not fire if the document wasn't ready
[05:04:09] <knickabocka> Shambat: no. i mean with the mosaic plugin: http://buildinternet.com/project/mosaic/
[05:04:25] <knickabocka> plus lightbox^1^
[05:04:26] <knickabocka> ^^
[05:04:57] <NoReGreT> what's the difference between "keydown" and "keypress" events
[05:05:16] <knickabocka> keydown is end result
[05:05:26] <NodeX> keypress is keydown+keyup
[05:05:27] <knickabocka> press is the operatoin of pressing
[05:05:59] <NodeX> much like a click is a mousedown and mouseup
[05:06:02] <NoReGreT> thanks
[05:06:11] <knickabocka> k
[05:06:26] <knickabocka> Shamba: u know one?
[05:06:29] <NoReGreT> best event for a return is "keyup", right ?
[05:06:58] <NodeX> to stop your app swelling yes
[05:07:05] <Shambat> knickabocka: no not really :P
[05:07:14] <NodeX> but a keydown should do just aswel
[05:07:14] <Shambat> just wanted to clarify
[05:07:20] <knickabocka> k
[05:07:51] <NodeX> for suggestive search / autocomplete I use keyup
[05:09:59] <NoReGreT> can someone please direct me to the options available to the event param

[05:14:09] <Cork> alaing: preventDefault
[05:14:10] <D4> NodeX » http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ according to this example they aren't using url?
[05:15:02] <raj> where can I find a good reading on the jquery object?
[05:15:15] <alaing> Cork would that stop any other events from firing?
[05:15:22] <Cork> no
[05:15:22] <D4> NodeX » My bad, they're assigning "url" to whatever 'action' attribute is set to
[05:15:32] <Cork> ?.preventDefault @ alaing
[05:15:33] <bot-t> alaing, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/

[05:22:05] <K3|Chris|Work> not straight numbers
[05:22:07] <fayimora> do i need to know javascript to learn jquery?
[05:22:08] <cpaq> I have this script using Ajax.  http://jsfiddle.net/qS9a7/ and it works, the ajax return value is as expect.  But the problem is, it comes to late.  When I click the first time I get the initialized value instead of the ajax returned value, and then when I click again, I get the returned value, but for the previous click, Anyone know how this works?
[05:22:11] <raj> what's the difference btwn $("input[type='checkbox']") and $(":checkbox") ?
[05:22:13] <D4> What would be the easiest way for me to convert from using a form POST to self applying to php $_SESSION to using .post() in jQ to do the actual posting part? I basically just want to prevent page reload AND still do what the form does now.
[05:22:19] <Cork> K3|Chris: check again, that is a variable
[05:22:34] <K3|Chris|Work> yeah but that's not what I'm talking about
[05:22:48] <K3|Chris|Work> var totalWidth = itemWidth + inflateDivs.toFixed(1);
[05:22:50] <Cork> then i'm not sure what your talking about
[05:23:16] <fayimora> I knw programming concepts, I program in java, c++ and Ruby mainly. I know A LITTLE bit javascript.. DO i still need to learn javascript to learn jquery?

[05:24:19] <Cork> K3|Chris|Work: you should NEVER round a number before calculating with it though
[05:24:38] <K3|Chris|Work> I'm not
[05:24:45] <K3|Chris|Work> I'm rounding the result
[05:24:55] <Cork> uh.. no
[05:24:56] <raj> Cork?
[05:25:00] <K3|Chris|Work> uh yes
[05:25:08] <Cork> inflateDivs.toFixed(1) is rounded
[05:25:08] <raj> what's the difference btwn $("input[type='checkbox']") and $(":checkbox")
[05:25:10] <raj> ?
[05:25:14] <Cork> itemWidth is not
[05:25:22] <K3|Chris|Work> itemwidth is constant
[05:25:29] <fayimora> cpaq:  pls could you advice me on  some tuts i should look at?
[05:25:42] <Cork> raj: the first one uses pure selectors, the second loops the found elements through a selection function
[05:26:04] <Cork> K3|Chris|Work: anyway toFixed isn't meant to be used in calculation
[05:26:09] <Cork> its for rendering
[05:26:10] <cpaq> fayimora, eloquent javascript is the best book, but very detailed
[05:26:22] <Cork> K3|Chris|Work: it returns a string, not a number
[05:26:43] <fayimora> cpaq:  couldn't agree less.. I already bought it..thanks
[05:27:08] <raj> Cork, do they return the same exact object?
[05:27:27] <K3|Chris|Work> Cork: is there some other way to restrict a number to one single digit without ever rounding up?
[05:27:48] <K3|Chris|Work> 180.499999999 = 180.4
[05:28:04] <cpaq> fayimora, you didn't like it?
[05:28:24] <NodeX> there is a toPrecision function if I recall correctly
[05:28:37] <nFFF> K3|Chris, is that 49999 reoccuring?
[05:28:45] <nFFF> if so its the same a .45
[05:28:50] <alaing> Cork would calling $('button').button() destroy any data/events already applied to a button?
[05:29:14] <NodeX> nFFF not if it's a latitude or longitude!!
[05:29:38] <K3|Chris|Work> nFFF: no infinite 9s
[05:29:51] <K3|Chris|Work> aka .5
[05:29:56] <cpaq> if you have a javascipt function that makes a jquery call, I am finding the scripts continues to run and finishes before the ajax function finishes, so how you require you script to wait?
[05:29:56] <nFFF> NodeX, .9*  is the same as 1
[05:30:19] <NodeX> nFFF no it's not lol
[05:30:24] <NodeX> K3|Chris https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toPrecision
[05:30:36] <nFFF> NodeX, it isn't? :|
[05:30:46] <NodeX> not in lat/long it';s not
[05:31:04] <cpaq> oh, I got it, put it in the success block of the $.ajax call
[05:31:04] <nFFF> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...
[05:31:11] <nFFF> pretty sure it is
[05:31:18] <NodeX> as a number yes not as a lat/long
[05:31:28] <NodeX> that would make it X feet out of it's true point
[05:31:36] <nFFF> We are talking as a real number though..
[05:31:58] <NodeX> if you re-read what I said then you will know I am NOT talking about a real number
[05:32:05] <NodeX> [13:29:08] <NodeX> nFFF not if it's a latitude or longitude!!
[05:32:20] <nFFF> Yea I only know about the real number :D
[05:33:55] <K3|Chris|Work> NodeX: that rounds up though, not just cuts off any additional digits
[05:36:43] <K3|Chris|Work> "totalWith.substring(4) is not a function" :\
[05:37:55] <Xotix> How do i attach keypress() to a contenteditable div?
[05:39:31] <freakabcd> hi all
[05:39:37] <antgel_> hi all, i have a three-column layout.  the right column is a thin sidebar.  upon some event, i need it to 1.) change content 2) change size (it should grow in width to overlap with the middle column). i'm a bit intimidated, little confused as to whether i need to use toggle or hide / show in jquery ui
[05:39:57] <antgel_> the column wouldn't disappear, just become thinner
[05:40:13] <freakabcd> I get this error:  $("perm" + a).appendChild is not a function
[05:41:04] <freakabcd> the line of code is $("perm" + a).appendChild(p);    I have perm1, perm2 and perm3 divs. a is iterated from 1 to 3  and p is a new div created everytime within the loop
[05:41:40] <fayimora> cpaq:  haven't read itâ€¦ i just scanned try it and it looked quite interesting
[05:42:42] <arek_deepinit> freakabcd:  why wont You give them a class?
[05:43:20] <arek_deepinit> freakabcd: currently You can apply attach as many classes as you wont to dome element
[05:43:24] <arek_deepinit> DOM
[05:43:33] <freakabcd> arek_deepinit, what do you mean?
[05:43:55] <AdvoWork> i've got a a href link, with a certain data attribute. If i right click and inspect element, it shows as: data-date_expected_modified="2012-03-07".  I change this with some other code, and if i inspect, it shows: data-date_expected_modified="2012-03-21".  The problem is, im trying to get these results, but when i do, it still shows the old result. Any suggestions please?
[05:44:26] <arek_deepinit> You got four divs apparently somehow related:), so give them common class  like : my4DivsCollection
[05:44:40] <arek_deepinit> it will be faster
[05:45:30] <freakabcd> arek_deepinit, disregarding that, can you tell me why it is giving me this error?
[05:45:45] <freakabcd> at first i trhought there is something wrong with my selector
[05:45:54] <freakabcd> but i don;t think that is the case
[05:46:59] <cpaq> fayimora, jquery is ten times easier than javascript
[05:47:22] <tapas> in ie8 in ie7 compatibility mode i get an error on a statement like: 		dialog = $("#produktantwort-dialog");
[05:47:28] <arek_deepinit> freakabcd: its cause You are using jquery object probably
[05:47:32] <fayimora> cpaq:  so i heard.. am going to take the course at code school but i goes i need to know javascript first :(
[05:47:55] <freakabcd> arek_deepinit, eh? i didn;t understand that
[05:47:58] <tapas> the document definitely contains that element. so i wonder what else could cause that error..
[05:48:09] <imc> freakabcd: you store a result
[05:48:16] <imc> and ask what is data of that result
[05:48:22] <arek_deepinit> jquery object has  append/appendTo method
[05:48:28] <imc> even if you changed the dom, you still have old result
[05:48:30] <Cork> tapas: it sounds more like a parsing error
[05:48:35] <arek_deepinit> http://api.jquery.com/append/
[05:48:43] <tapas> the german error in ie is roughly translated: "the object doesn't support this property or method"
[05:48:51] <tapas> Cork: possibly :D
[05:49:17] <Cork> tapas: try commenting out part of the js, and see if the erro goes away
[05:49:19] <freakabcd> imc, i still don;t understand what you mean
[05:49:33] <imc> freakabcd: var X = $(selector)
[05:49:46] <imc> X.data('expected-date') = date1
[05:49:47] <arek_deepinit> it returns you Jquery object
[05:49:48] <freakabcd> $("perm" + 1)   does that or does it not select the div with id="perm1" ?
[05:49:52] <tapas> Cork: Cork ok..
[05:50:06] <imc> function_that_do_something_with(X) (i.e. changin data attribute on DOM)
[05:50:19] <imc> $(selector).data('expected-date') = newDate
[05:50:25] <imc> X.data('expected-date') = date1
[05:50:29] <imc> is it clear freakabcd ?
[05:50:36] <freakabcd> ah ok. it is clear now
[05:50:57] <imc> you should do: X = function_that_do_something_ona
[05:50:59] <freakabcd> was the type of code i mentioned working with perhaps an ancient version of jquery ?
[05:51:04] <imc> you should do: X = function_that_do_something_on_and_returns_new_copy_of(X)
[05:51:08] <tapas> Cork: the interesting thing is that the same js code runs fine in FF and chrome..
[05:51:21] <arek_deepinit> freakabcd: it does select in but its wrapped into jquery object
[05:51:40] <imc> freakabcd: you should pay attention about function CATEGORY on jquery API, i.e. DOM modification VS inspection/traversing
[05:51:40] <freakabcd> cos i'm not sure how old this code is and it is "working" currently on a server. i'm updating it and doing some maintenance on it
[05:51:44] <K3|Chris|Work> Cork: bah just figured it out var totalWidth = itemWidth + (Math.floor(inflateDivs * 10) / 10) =P
[05:51:45] <Cork> tapas: ie's engin is often much picker then the other ones
[05:52:00] <fayimora> cpaq:  would read eloquent js, do the code school course on jquery and start reading JQuery in action.. Then would get to backbone!
[05:52:06] <Cork> K3|Chris|Work: yup, like i said :)
[05:52:25] <imc> freakabcd: no idea
[05:52:26] <K3|Chris|Work> you did?...
[05:52:32] <freakabcd> i.e. the local copy on my machine gives the error while the one on the server (identical code but different jquery version) works fine without error
[05:52:39] <tapas> Cork: ok..
[05:52:57] <freakabcd> anyway, thanks. i understood what you guys meant. thanks
[05:53:13] <imc> freakabcd: had somewhat same kind of problem this morning :P you're welcome
[05:54:10] <antgel_> trying to understand http://jqueryui.com/demos/show/.  what in the source code makes the div hidden at the *start*?  *blush*
[05:54:28] <freakabcd> i was going nuts just now as the sources printed out from "show source" in FF on the server page and my local machine page are identical
[05:55:19] <fotoflo> I have a weird problem with jqueryi-ui.dialog()  -- has anyone seen something like this before: http://screencast.com/t/bLHX3VNv6
[05:55:20] <fotoflo> ?
[05:55:40] <marekw2143> why does .width() returns different value from DOM's element .clientWidth value?
[06:01:45] <cpaq> hi, http://jsfiddle.net/ruu2L/ anyone can tell me why $('#apnd-l > img').live('click', function() { ... isn't happening?
[06:05:59] <Xotix> cpaq use on live is deprecated on 1.7
[06:06:31] <cpaq> Xotix, what do we use now?
[06:06:43] <Xotix> $('#foo').on('click', function()
[06:06:52] <Xotix> on()
[06:13:51] <zatan> hi how can i append text by pressing ENTER or Click ? http://jsfiddle.net/FDhU7/
[06:15:49] <xec> cpaq: it works? http://jsfiddle.net/ruu2L/1/
[06:16:06] <xec> cpaq: all i did was added the alert
[06:16:49] <xec> cpaq: get an error in console about tint2 not being defined though
[06:17:00] <xec> cpaq: maybe the issue isn't the event not firing? ;)
[06:17:39] <cpaq> xec, thx
[06:17:51] <Xotix> zatan http://jsfiddle.net/FDhU7/1/ ?
[06:18:14] <Xotix> you need to listen on the click of the button, not the one of the input.
[06:18:19] <zatan> Xotix, thanks but its not appending if am pressing ENTER
[06:18:38] <cpaq> xec, thats wierd
[06:18:54] <Xotix> ah then do keypress(e.which = 12)
[06:18:55] <Xotix> 13
[06:20:11] <xec> or keydown
[06:20:12] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/FDhU7/2/
[06:20:41] <xec> of course, you might want to move the preventDefault() to inside the if
[06:20:50] <xec> if you want to type something :P
[06:21:32] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/FDhU7/3/
[06:22:09] <xec> zatan: you also had the click event binding inside the key event, binding over and over
[06:22:29] <antgel_> trying to understand http://jqueryui.com/demos/show/.  what in the source code makes the div hidden at the *start*?  *blush*
[06:23:02] <xec> antgel_: $( "#effect" ).hide();
[06:23:10] <xec> last line of the script
[06:24:18] <zatan> xec,  this one looks that I repeating all the same http://jsfiddle.net/Jm3EF/ ? is there anyway to do for example " if (e.keyCode == 13) {   OR $("#click").click(function(e) {" ?
[06:25:13] <xec> zatan: you can listen to multiple events, or better in your case: make a function that you call in both cases
[06:26:37] <xec> zatan: http://jsfiddle.net/Jm3EF/1/ something like this
[06:26:55] <xec> of course, you'll want to name it something better than doStuff ;)
[06:27:26] <zatan> xec,  cheers for your help thats the way I wanted ;)
[06:27:32] <raj> do $("input[type='checkbox']") and $(":checkbox") return the exact same object?
[06:27:36] <raj> also, which one is faster?
[06:28:54] <xec> raj: the first should be faster, only because you included "input"
[06:29:16] <xec> raj: http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[06:29:39] <xec> raj: they should return the same thing, yes
[06:36:06] <Smilex> I have two IDs, is it possible to bind a function to both of them, without duplicating the code?
[06:36:31] <Gozzy> sure
[06:36:35] <xec> Smilex: you can combine selectors with a comma
[06:36:42] <Smilex> xec, thanks
[06:36:54] <xec> $("#id_one, #id_two")
[06:37:02] <xec> if that's what you meant
[06:40:49] <LekeFly> Is there a way to disable a plugin if the device is touch based.. ? :p
[06:41:55] <NodeX> unbind it?
[06:43:45] <raj> thanks xec
[06:43:58] <raj> should i use $('input:checkbox') instead?
[06:44:13] <xec> slightly better, yes :)
[06:44:33] <raj> for reading or performance?
[06:44:43] <xec> performance
[06:44:46] <raj> cool
[06:45:09] <raj> xec, and what's your preference for checking if it's checked?
[06:45:16] <raj> attr('checked')?

[06:45:29] <raj> .is(':checked') ?

[07:31:55] <raj> xec, still around?
[07:32:26] * xec hides
[07:34:05] <raj> haha
[07:34:14] <aqeel> lol
[07:34:16] <raj> xec, I was wondering if this makes sense--> http://paste.ofcode.org/Nq28yBC2NKhRTEmiX7pyi2
[07:34:49] <aqeel> so running from problems today..........
[07:34:50] <xec> what are you trying to do?
[07:34:58] <der_On> hello
[07:35:56] <jarr0dsz> hey jquery gurus!
[07:35:59] <Carlitta87> gf3: do u no a better way i cud, validate an input field?
[07:36:11] <jarr0dsz> i was hoping someone could help me out a tiny bit with some code i have been working on for some time now
[07:36:17] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/25/ its a collapser expander
[07:36:21] <gf3> Carlitta87: yes, you could use a jQueryUI Calendar
[07:36:23] <raj> xec, basically, I want to have checked_items show which items are checked at any given time
[07:36:29] <raj> and it should update anytime there is a change
[07:36:30] <der_On> I'm currently trying to use jQuery.getJSON('http://localhost:3001') while on 'http://localhost:3000', I have a python script running a http server on port 3001 returning a response with content-type application/json ,but the response body is empty. however if I enter localhost:3001 directly in the browser i get a response body
[07:36:41] <jarr0dsz> im not good at jqueyr at all still learning, trying to make it collapse only when you click the close icon top left, how could one do that?
[07:36:44] <raj> so I can do an ajax call with it
[07:37:06] <xec> raj: rather than storing it in a global, why don't you just create the array when you need it
[07:37:08] <jarr0dsz> now toggle.this is used to toggle so i need another way of setting class closed when a certain div is clicked the .closed class div
[07:37:27] <raj> xec, that's fine
[07:37:36] <raj> i thought putting 'var' before it makes it not a global?
[07:37:50] <xec> well, it's top level in that code
[07:38:03] <aqeel> placement in or out of funtion makes it local or global
[07:38:07] <LukeNukem> Hello all :D

[07:38:42] <raj> xec, so the code actually makes sense?
[07:38:44] <raj> :)
[07:38:49] <LukeNukem> is mousedown and mouseup the scrolling buttons?
[07:38:51] <LukeNukem> xec,
[07:39:21] <xec> no

[07:44:27] <xec> i doubt it, LukeNukem
[07:44:32] <xec> have you tried google?
[07:44:45] <LukeNukem> yes

[07:45:14] <jkarsrud> that is .scroll()
[07:45:24] <jkarsrud> no matter what you say
[07:45:57] <LukeNukem> Is it possible to detect a keystroke?

[07:50:52] <TheKaiser> any idea how to make the div icons reposition themselves in the droppable li?

[07:52:14] <jeffkiesel> Hi all, i have a question about the hover effect on table rows.
[07:52:28] <jeffkiesel> the common way to handle this seems to be as follows:  http://jsfiddle.net/czcUS/6/
[07:52:38] <jeffkiesel> 4 lines of javascript there
[07:53:11] <jeffkiesel> this is fine, but it is awfully slow in ie7 when we're dealing with , say 1000 table rows.
[07:53:43] <jeffkiesel> is there a more efficient way to to do table row hovers with a large dom?
[07:54:11] <xec> css?
[07:54:37] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/czcUS/7/
[07:55:16] <optikalmouse> I have an .on() call that looks like this $('.abc').on('click', {x:true}, methods.whatever); what would would the methods.whatever handler look like?
[07:55:53] <nFFF> function(){}
[07:55:53] <nFFF> ?
[07:55:58] <aqeel> yup
[07:56:15] <jeffkiesel> thanks xec, i will check if thatworks in ie7
[07:57:28] <hashpuppy> posted it on SO, if that's easier:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9569737/need-help-w-instance-variables-in-this-jquery-plugin
[07:57:29] <ag4ve> how do i bind an event to a drop down? i've tried bind, live, and change and nothing seems to work...?
[07:57:52] <nFFF> ag4ve, be more specific
[07:58:03] <nFFF> when they actually click the drop down, or the value changes?
[07:58:11] <fof> jeffkiesel: would using on() delegated event be faster? attach event just to tbody
[07:58:55] <fof> or actually css seems a good idea too
[07:59:44] <panchot> hi
[08:00:12] <TheKaiser> any idea how to rewrite this
[08:00:15] <TheKaiser> 					ui.draggable.position({ of: $(this), my: 'left top', at: 'left top' });
[08:00:28] <panchot> im trying to perform a $('a').click(); after instert the <a> tag into the dom
[08:00:31] <TheKaiser> instead of setting the position, moving the line of code from li1 into li2?
[08:00:35] <panchot> the event is not triggered
[08:00:47] <BoxTest> Hey is anyone able to assist me with having my lists connect with jquery sortable?
[08:01:06] <jeffkiesel> fof , good suggestion
[08:01:18] <BoxTest> example code: http://jsfiddle.net/4WJUb/1/
[08:01:56] <ag4ve> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/185271
[08:02:13] <ag4ve> nFFF: ^^ is what i mean by 'not working'...
[08:03:08] <AdvoWork> I'm doing: $("#somediv").load('order.php?number='+ purchase_order_number).dialog({//stuff}), and then when I close it down, im doing: if($('somediv').length > 0) { $('somediv').dialog( "close" ); $( "#somediv" ).dialog("destroy"); }  yet when i open up other elements of somediv, i see the previous content there for a second and then it changes to the new, why isn't it destroying the previous?
[08:04:12] <panchot> example code http://jsfiddle.net/gGBPA/
[08:04:48] <aqeel> please any looking intio my issue
[08:04:57] <aqeel> into*
[08:05:52] <larister> BoxTest: what's the issue you're having?
[08:06:07] <panchot> please. help?
[08:06:08] <panchot> http://jsfiddle.net/gGBPA/
[08:06:23] <BoxTest> larister,  they don't connect. I'm trying to have them connect so that I can move the slides over from one side to the other
[08:07:08] <aqeel> my code seems working fine but the on() function is somehow making it multiply....the clikcs
[08:07:13] <BoxTest> larister,  http://jsfiddle.net/4WJUb/1/  going from one to the other
[08:07:57] <xarxer> if I in my document.ready function has a handler for click for links, and I later on append links to the document, the handlers in the document.ready function won't be called... How can I solve this?
[08:08:40] <aqeel> xarxer......use on()
[08:08:58] <aqeel> it can even implement the code function afte the element was created
[08:09:06] <xarxer> aqeel: like $('a').on("click", myFunction);?
[08:09:29] <ajpiano> xarxer: $(document).on("click", "a", myFunction);
[08:09:31] <aqeel> $('a').....type parent container
[08:09:37] <aqeel> yes
[08:09:54] <aqeel> document is universal....
[08:10:10] <aqeel> if want to be specific use parent container
[08:10:28] <LordThumper> the nearest stable parent preferably
[08:10:31] <aqeel> it bubles up from inner element to the container......u specify
[08:10:44] <xarxer> ajpiano, aqeel: thanks, that worked fine :)
[08:10:47] <ag4ve> eh, document is not universal, document is for the dom
[08:10:56] <larister> BoxTest, do you mean that at the moment one list is below the other and you want them to be side by side? The sorting seems to be working for me...
[08:11:05] <aqeel> yes but for buble it is the last limit
[08:11:27] <BoxTest> larister I want to be able to move LIST ONE into LIST TWO (you may need to refresh)
[08:11:35] <BoxTest> http://jsfiddle.net/4WJUb/2/
[08:12:13] <larister> BoxTest, ah apologies with you now. one minute
[08:12:30] <BoxTest> larister, no worries I appreciate the assistance
[08:14:55] <jeffkiesel> does anyone know which would be faster:  addClass() or style() for changing a background color?
[08:15:26] <NoiseEee> jeffkiesel: your decision on that shouldn't be about speed at all, but about organization
[08:16:10] <jeffkiesel> NoiseEee: it is unsuable in ie7, so unfortunatley it does need to be about speed
[08:16:26] <NoiseEee> neither is unusable in ie7
[08:16:27] <jeffkiesel> otherwise, i aggree, all about organization
[08:16:40] <dabear> addclass will be faster
[08:16:45] <dabear> no animation
[08:16:58] <dabear> hm
[08:17:08] <jeffkiesel> my situation is i have a table with 1000+ rows in ie7, and the hover effect is super-laggy to the point of not being usable
[08:17:10] <dabear> I think I read wrong :(
[08:17:22] <jeffkiesel> thx dabear
[08:17:25] <larister> BoxTest sorry something's come up, not sure I'll be able to see this through but basically it looks like your selectors are the issue
[08:17:56] <BoxTest> larister, no worries I thank you for the advice either way
[08:18:30] <NoiseEee> jeffkiesel: and not to get all whiny and stuff, but table with 1000+ rows is a major UI mistake
[08:18:32] <larister> BoxTest no probs will keep on looking when I get a sec
[08:18:38] <NoiseEee> jeffkiesel: but whatevs, your call
[08:18:47] <jeffkiesel> not my decision NoiseEee
[08:18:52] <BoxTest> larister,  much appreciated
[08:19:07] <jeffkiesel> i agree with you
[08:19:15] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: is the hover effect unusable because of how long it takes to actually bind the handlers?
[08:19:21] <ajpiano> instead of how long it takes to actually do the style change?
[08:19:33] <asdf`> Uh, i've got a little problem with cross-domain $.getJSON queries. The following code works with chrome, FF and IE for me, but doesn't work with opera: http://shapley.pl/cross.html - ( http://trewq.pl/cross.html is the same file but in the same domain as the json file)
[08:20:09] <jeffkiesel> ajpiano: , no, unusable because the hover effect takes waaay too much time to even happen when going from row to row
[08:20:38] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: then theoretically the number of rows would be immaterial
[08:20:53] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: have you considered just toggling a class instead of mucking about with styles directly
[08:21:10] <jeffkiesel> i am currently adding and removing classes ajpiano
[08:21:30] <jeffkiesel> i was just asking if .css() would be faster, seems no
[08:22:07] <jeffkiesel> right now i am exploring using the on() function and mouseenter and mouseleave
[08:31:04] <andrew___> I'm tryign to use table sorter plugins
[08:31:11] <AdvoWork> I'm doing: $("#somediv").load('order.php?number='+ purchase_order_number).dialog({//stuff}), and then when I close it down, im doing: if($('somediv').length > 0) { $('somediv').dialog( "close" ); $( "#somediv" ).dialog("destroy"); }  yet when i open up other elements of somediv, i see the previous content there for a second and then it changes to the new, why isn't it destroying the previous?
[08:31:17] <andrew___> But I have ths on each row..
[08:31:22] <andrew___> *THs on each row
[08:31:30] <andrew___> Oh wait, nm :x
[08:33:17] <kollapse> Hello. Performance wise, what would be faster to use - .hasClass() or .attr() ?
[08:34:10] <xec> kollapse: they don't do the same thing, but if you have a use case where they would be equivalent you can check with jsperf.com
[08:34:56] <kollapse> Yes, I have to choose between `.hasClass('some_value')` and `.attr(`my_field`) === 'some_value'`
[08:35:23] <xec> my_field ?
[08:35:45] <kollapse> Sure. Like <div my_field='something'>
[08:35:58] <kollapse> Sure, standard calls for data-* names though.
[08:36:33] <xec> ah i see. well, like i said, jsperf will tell you ;)
[08:36:52] <rocky> what's the most common way of documenting jquery-based code? i mean what doc tool do people use for this stuff?
[08:37:14] <larister> BoxTest you still there?
[08:37:21] <BoxTest> larister, aye
[08:37:31] <larister> BoxTest http://jsfiddle.net/4WJUb/4/
[08:37:37] <larister> BoxTest any help?
[08:37:40] <JillesCode> Hey guys, I have a mouseclick event, where I append an image, now I also made a mouseleave event, and I want the appended image to disapear, how would I do this?
[08:38:23] <larister> BoxTest looks like maybe a dummy li might be needed in the second list
[08:38:37] <BoxTest> ahh if that's the case I may have issues lol
[08:38:56] <ag4ve> any pointers on making an event handler work with a drop down? i don't feel i'm anywhere closer to a solution with this: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/185275
[08:41:11] <BoxTest> larister,  but it still won't cross over. I may have to make the style to position: absolute because right now it's in a DIV that has an overflow of auto
[08:42:03] <larister> BoxTest I have no idea why though, it should handle them fine.
[08:42:16] <larister> BoxTest anyway I've got to go, good luck!!
[08:42:18] <BoxTest> larister, http://jsfiddle.net/4WJUb/5/
[08:42:23] <BoxTest> Thanks for the help
[08:43:18] <larister> BoxTest sure sorry I can't see it through.
[08:43:43] <Bogomip> Hi there - im trying to utilise Jquery UIs "Sortable" feature and what im trying to do is dynamically add things to the sort stack via $.get. This all works just find, HOWEVER the Sortable I put the data into does not resize. Any ideas how I can put dynamic data (through ajax) into sortable and have the sortable box resize depending upon content? :)
[08:44:04] <Bogomip> *fine
[08:44:56] <nights``> hi
[08:45:22] <Bogomip> hi
[08:48:57] <knickabocka> is it a problem to include 2 diferent version of jquery lib?
[08:49:14] <knickabocka> can that give errors?
[08:49:48] <Bogomip> you will overload the functions surely
[08:49:56] <thang> it sure as hell cant help
[08:50:14] <Bogomip> so either your browser will complain, or it will load the last ones in the script
[08:50:15] <thang> Bogomip: so you want Sortable to arbitrarily resize based on the data?
[08:50:20] <Bogomip> yes
[08:50:30] <Bogomip> thats exactly it, in a much more succinct way than I put it :)
[08:50:37] <nights``> anyone know how to get a coordinates  within a div (local mouse coords) ?
[08:50:43] <nights``>  $('#status').html(e.pageX +', '+ e.pageY);Â¨
[08:52:38] <LukeNukem> how can i use jquery to control the html 5 player
[08:53:33] <thang> $('#videoID').get(0).play()/.pause()
[08:54:54] <thang> Bogomip: its not your exact solution, but have you tried http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#option-forcePlaceholderSize
[08:55:47] <Bogomip> hmm, ill have a look
[08:56:06] <BoxTest> Hey guys. I have an element in a overflow:auto I was wondering if I apply z-index:100 to it will it remove will it allow me to go to the next pane over withouc hiccups
[08:56:31] <BoxTest> Right now it goes over , but you can't see the image actually move over until you lift the mouse
[08:56:46] <thang> Bogomip: if anything, after the ajax call you can count how many elements are returned and resize the sortable box based on that... i dont exactly have a cleaner solution in my head right now.
[08:57:13] <jeffkiesel> so it turns out that using the on() function and mouseenter/leave is still tooo slow  ajpiano, any other thoughts?
[08:57:26] <Bogomip> hmm ok, thanks thang :) Ill have a play around and if this paceholderSize doesnt work I will botch some stuff togetehr and force it manually :)
[08:57:33] <jeffkiesel> you seem to think it may be an issue binding all of those events?
[08:58:09] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: are you using $("#yourtable").on("mouseenter mouseleave", "tr", fn) or are you using $("#yourtable tr").on("mouseenter mouseleave", fn);
[08:58:36] <jeffkiesel> ajpiano: the first option, which i believ is a delegated event
[08:58:41] <ajpiano> yeah
[08:58:53] <jeffkiesel> is that the better option of the two?
[08:59:02] <ajpiano> typically yes.
[08:59:07] <jeffkiesel> ok
[08:59:19] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: what are you actually trying to implement
[08:59:27] <jeffkiesel> it truly is a failure of the ui design, but i'm tasked with finding the solution
[09:00:05] <kollapse> xec: It would seem .hasClass() is faster - http://jsperf.com/element-identification Thanks
[09:00:14] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: it can't be achieved in pure css ?
[09:00:16] <jeffkiesel> it's a shame even a purely css hover is slow
[09:00:21] <jeffkiesel> tried that actually
[09:00:26] <jeffkiesel> it was shocking slow
[09:01:44] <nights``> anyone know how to get a coordinates  within a div (local mouse coords) ?
[09:01:52] <nights``> this is for the entire page $('#status').html(e.pageX +', '+ e.pageY);
[09:02:08] <xec> jeffkiesel: are you sure there's nothing else slowing the browser down?
[09:02:11] <nights``> what can i do to get something in my div with id #area
[09:02:48] <jeffkiesel> fairly sure
[09:02:57] <jeffkiesel> will continue to evaluate though
[09:03:03] <Bogomip> .append() nights``?
[09:03:34] <nights``> hmm
[09:03:35] <nights``> what?
[09:03:37] <nights``> :S
[09:03:48] <nights``> i mean i need mouse coordinates inside a div
[09:03:53] <nights``> so top left should 0 0
[09:04:11] <Bogomip> oh
[09:04:17] <nights``> should be easy
[09:04:19] <nights``> but im lost
[09:04:27] <nights``> probably pageX etc
[09:04:32] <Bogomip> get the coordinates in the window and subtract the distance the div is from the top and left of the page
[09:04:32] <nights``> should be like a selector
[09:04:37] <nights``> hm
[09:04:39] <nights``> isnt there a better way?
[09:04:49] <Bogomip> dunno, seems like an ok way to me :)
[09:05:06] <nights``> ok
[09:05:07] <nights``> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position#Tracking_mouse_position
[09:05:07] <Bogomip> afaik you cant take the cursor position relative to a div naturally
[09:05:12] <nights``> the last example is doing that
[09:05:16] <Bogomip> but i havent used that much
[09:05:16] <nights``> var x = e.pageX - this.offsetLeft;
[09:05:21] <Bogomip> yeah
[09:05:22] <nights``> ok
[09:05:24] <nights``> thanks very much
[09:05:25] <nights``> i see
[09:05:28] <Bogomip> thats ok isnt it?
[09:05:29] <Bogomip> :)
[09:05:33] <nights``> hoped there was a way to get mousemove directly in a div
[09:05:36] <nights``> yeah
[09:05:41] <nights``> if this is the way, its the way
[09:05:42] <nights``> :)
[09:05:44] <Bogomip> ah I see, nah, not that I ever found :D
[09:05:51] <nights``> i mean
[09:05:54] <nights``> it works to do
[09:05:57] <nights``> $('#block').mousemove(function(e){
[09:05:58] <nights``> on your div
[09:06:04] <nights``> and that only gives mousemove for your div
[09:06:11] <nights``> so then naturally you would think you could also get the coords
[09:06:20] <nights``> i mean, how else does jquery know the mouse is inside the div=?
[09:06:20] <nights``> :)
[09:06:26] <nights``> well, somehow they dont expose that
[09:06:30] <nights``> maybe someone was lazy
[09:06:54] <ajpiano> nights``: to get the coords within the div you use the page coordinates and subtract the div's offset
[09:07:18] <ajpiano> it knows it's there because elements fire mouseover and mouseout events when they are entered and left
[09:15:04] <themachine> any reason why after setting a ui-dialog html contents through ajax via dalog.html(content), the first link is hightlighted?
[09:15:10] <Travis-42> Is the jQuery Validation plugin the best option in general for jquery validation?
[09:17:09] <nights``> hm
[09:17:10] <Chopps> hey guys, quick question, i have a select element with 3 options, but depending on some action i will add more options to it, the thing is i can execute more actions and then need to remove those options i added earlier and add new ones, so the question is, is there any way to create like a stock select element from the original unmodiffied select element?? thanks in advance
[09:17:19] <nights``> so goes this doesnt work at all for scrolling et
[09:17:28] <nights``> this is why i wanted to avoid using pagex,y
[09:17:30] <nights``> man
[09:17:34] <nights``> jquery sucks :(
[09:18:21] <Bogomip> lies!
[09:18:26] <ajpiano> a poor craftsman blames his tools
[09:20:33] <nights``> blasphemy!
[09:21:08] <nights``> well
[09:21:20] <nights``> they really should have exposed mouse coords in a selectable
[09:21:31] <nights``> since its obviously implemented underneath
[09:22:10] <Bogomip> you cant dislike jquery, I have made a fully interactive ajax website with all kinds of lovelys on in 3 hours not having used ANY of these particular bits of JQuery UI before, AND I got a nice colour scheme to boot :)
[09:22:49] <Bogomip> now all i have to do is get rid of this sizing issue and im sound as a pound!
[09:23:02] <nights``> LOL
[09:23:03] <nights``> http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[09:23:05] <nights``> have a look at this
[09:23:57] <nights``> clientX and pageX is the same in firefox
[09:24:04] <nights``> now if thats not bad..
[09:24:10] <_markh_> My app needs to validate some user input and I'd like to I'm trying (and failing) to set focus to a text area in its blur handler.  The code I have is
[09:24:11] <_markh_> function() {$(this).focus(); e.preventDefault(); return false;}
[09:24:13] <_markh_> If I click on the app, focus goes to the app. If I switch to a different browser tab and back, all is well.
[09:24:14] <_markh_> I've tried timers, and calling/not calling e.preventDefault and returning/not returning false.
[09:24:25] <nights``> same in chrome
[09:24:28] <nights``> dont get it...
[09:24:57] <Bogomip> i dont understand your issue now nights``, I thought you solved it?
[09:25:27] <nights``> no
[09:25:49] <nights``> it doesnt work because my div is absolute position
[09:26:00] <nights``> instead im suppose to use clientX,Y
[09:26:06] <nights``> which seem to be broken
[09:26:11] <nights``> even on api.jquery lol
[09:27:01] <nights``> when i scroll the pageY change but not the div offsetTop
[09:27:16] <nights``> this is one of the reasons i wanted to avoid using pageX,Y in the first place
[09:28:18] <Bogomip> position = $("#divid").offset().left - pageX
[09:28:20] <Bogomip> nights``?
[09:30:42] <soc42> hi #jquery
[09:31:57] <Bogomip> thang - twas a silly resolution in the end, the JQuery UI CSS Restricts the size of each box in the CSS, and I just hadn't removed the 1.5em height constraint! :)
[09:32:02] <Bogomip> thanks for the help though
[09:33:27] <soc42> i want to reload a parent page from within a popup with a post request
[09:33:43] <soc42> is that possible?
[09:34:34] <soc42> i know how to set a javascript GET request but the page is only capable to handle POST requests
[09:35:18] <soc42> as i did a jQuery.post(data) with a GET string as data i get a success message, but the page has not been reloaded anyway?
[09:36:26] <Bogomip> does .ajax work with POST?
[09:36:29] <cybersholt> hello all does anybody know a good jQ plugin to mimic the navigation menu on this page ? http://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/ ?
[09:37:04] <eddiemonge> Bogomip: yes
[09:37:22] <slackgen> So if I create an element like --  element = $("<div><span></span></div>").appendTo(whatever);
[09:37:25] <eddiemonge> cybersholt: what navigation?
[09:37:25] <Bogomip> not exactly cyberalien but have a look here http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/38-jquery-and-css-drop-down-multi-level-menu-solutions/
[09:37:27] <slackgen> How would I select the inner span?
[09:37:50] <Deafgoose> given the following html (http://pastebin.com/vTzeTQhG) Im not sure what the selector would look to get the <tr class="odd"> and the <td><span></td> can anybody help
[09:37:52] <fris> http://www.designchemical.com/lab/jquery-mega-drop-down-menu-plugin/getting-started/
[09:37:53] <cybersholt> eddie the Top navigation with the drop down / images
[09:37:56] <Bogomip> slackgen - give it an id
[09:37:59] <eddiemonge> ? find @ slackgen
[09:37:59] <bot-t1> slackgen, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:38:16] <tfitts> anyone use the dataTables plugin with ajax data?
[09:38:19] <slackgen> Bogomip: won't work, needs to be called multiple times
[09:38:25] <Bogomip> give it a class :)
[09:38:26] <eddiemonge> cybersholt: there are a billion suckerfish drop down menus out there. it can be done in mostly css with some JS for ie fallback
[09:38:59] <cybersholt> thanks eddiemonge i thought i would ask
[09:39:02] <eddiemonge> Deafgoose: $(".odd")
[09:39:19] <eddiemonge> slackgen: just use .find()
[09:39:22] <slackgen> eddiemonge: find was perfect.
[09:39:24] <slackgen> thanks
[09:39:31] <fris> cyberalien the one i posted looks like the one that mimics the example you shown
[09:39:43] <eddiemonge> cybersholt: search for suckerfish menu. its what i always ise
[09:39:48] <nights``> Bogomip: amazingly that works!
[09:39:50] <Deafgoose> eddiemonge, I have many tds with that class, i just want to select the one right before
[09:39:51] <nights``> so
[09:39:54] <nights``> 		var x = $("#wardarea").offset().left - e.pageX;
[09:39:56] <nights``> works
[09:39:56] <nights``> but not
[09:40:04] <eddiemonge> Deafgoose: right before what?
[09:40:09] <nights``>  this.offsetLeft;
[09:40:19] <Deafgoose> <a class="todo_done">
[09:40:21] <slackgen> What is the difference between find() and children() ?
[09:40:21] <nights``> Bogomip: thanks vm!
[09:40:27] <cybersholt> yeah i've used variations of it myself i appreciate it
[09:40:53] <Bogomip> nights`` - you're welcome :)
[09:40:54] <eddiemonge> Deafgoose: thats not in your example markup
[09:41:02] <Deafgoose> http://pastebin.com/vTzeTQhG
[09:41:09] <eddiemonge> slackgen: children only checks immediate children but find keeps going
[09:41:14] <Deafgoose> a has multiple classes sorry
[09:41:29] <eddiemonge> ?has @ Deafgoose
[09:41:30] <bot-t1> Deafgoose, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[09:41:45] <slackgen> eddiemonge: argh I always mistake children as an alias for find. Thanks.
[09:45:54] <soc42> ok, another try... is it possible to update an opener page from a popup using a post request?
[09:47:42] <eddiemonge> opener page?
[09:48:31] <Chopps> hey guys, quick question, i have a select element with 3 options, but depending on some action i will add more options to it, the thing is i can execute more actions and then need to remove those options i added earlier and add new ones, so the question is, is there any way to create like a stock select element from the original unmodiffied select element?? thanks in advance
[09:48:43] <chris_w> Evenin' all
[09:48:55] <eddiemonge> morning
[09:49:41] <chris_w> If you need to add an attr to all links to a chunk of HTML (supplied via json), is it easer to do do it to the string before outputting it, or output it and then find all the a href's in the content area and add the atts there ?
[09:50:02] <eddiemonge> Chopps: you could add .data() info to the options that specify things like when they were added and then check those later to see if they need to be removed
[09:50:07] <BoxTest> I'm trying to use ajaxForm() from the jquery.form.js to perform an image upload using ajax but everytime the page loads I get jQuery not defined. Any reason other than jquery not being defined as to why that happens?
[09:50:08] <chris_w> I need to add re='external' to all links embeded in html coming from an external source
[09:50:41] <eddiemonge> chris_w: almost always do operations before adding stuff to the DOM
[09:51:01] <ajpiano> chris_w: it would be best to put into a document structure off the DOM, and then add it all to the dom after
[09:51:05] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: jquery not being defined would be a big one
[09:51:22] <ajpiano> chris_w: var foo = $(data);  foo.find("a").attr("rel", "external");  foo.appendTo( document.body ); or whatever
[09:51:32] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: beat you to it. of course you had to go get all detailed
[09:51:36] <BoxTest> eddiemonge,  i know but it's not my plugin lol.  following http://www.9lessons.info/2011/08/ajax-image-upload-without-refreshing.html that tutorial
[09:52:01] <chris_w> ajpiano, that sounds good, thanks both eddiemonge
[09:52:34] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: have you looked at the HTML5 file upload/reader?
[09:52:41] <Chopps> thanks eddiemonge i will digg into data() :D
[09:53:19] <BoxTest> eddiemonge, i have not no. mind providing a link?
[09:56:47] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: or maybe look at http://www.plupload.com/
[10:00:05] <Carlitta87> what is it called when you can select a value from a drop down list and it can change the value of a regualr input field?

[10:01:19] <BoxTest> eddiemonge,  pupload is just way too bulky . I just need something small to upload a <input type="file"
[10:01:27] <regedarek> Hi, i have problem with twitter bootstrap modal.js
[10:01:30] <regedarek> http://imm.io/hZ9l
[10:01:34] <regedarek> background is on the top and overlay modal popup
[10:01:42] <regedarek> how to diagnoze where is the problem??
[10:02:18] <eddiemonge> by inspecting the elements
[10:12:48] <chris_w> can could you chain $(string.something).find('a').attr('rel', 'external').appendTo($('#content') without the world breaking?  (string.something being a string containing a ref's that need the attr rel='external' added to them )
[10:13:22] <chris_w> Don't know it works when you create the document structure from a var (like ajpiano's earlier comment )
[10:13:36] <ajpiano> chris_w: once you do .find("a") ..., the selection only contains the anchors
[10:13:43] <chris_w> ahh right
[10:14:01] <ajpiano> so you'd have to traverse back up to it, etc
[10:14:01] <Eviltwin> So see ?.end
[10:14:05] <ajpiano> or that
[10:14:16] <chris_w> that makes sense
[10:14:27] <chris_w> your solution worked a treat, thanks
[10:14:46] <chris_w> just trying to get it to one line for no reason other than to see if it was possible ;)
[10:15:28] <Eviltwin> chris_w: I can appreciate that
[10:15:29] <RFleming> Greetings and salutations!
[10:15:43] <Eviltwin> I've written jQuery that doesn't use any vars before
[10:15:55] <Eviltwin> Not because it was a good idea, just because I could
[10:16:52] <RFleming> Can someone point me in the direction of how to have autocomplete show a grayed out complete in the search input (like in Google search)
[10:21:29] <andrew___> I have a link.. I want it to open a dialog with a left click, but if the click is the middle button (i.e. the open in new tab button) I want it to do that
[10:21:37] <andrew___> Is that just looking at the event data?
[10:23:43] <LukeNukem> hello

[10:32:03] <knightryder> looking for jquery libraries / plugins to implement seat map
[10:32:36] <knightryder> example: a movie theatre seat map / stadium seat map

[10:35:50] <knightryder> any help would be much appreciated
[10:40:51] <kurtis> Hey guys, is there any standards to follow when supplying JSON data? for example, I need to send JSON Data to the browser for display up until a certain point where I want to tell it to redirect to a "Success" or "error" page
[10:41:10] <kurtis> Not that I need standards ... just curious if there's any out there
[10:41:17] <chilversc> kurtis: why not just send an actual redirect?
[10:41:55] <chilversc> kurtis: or an actual success code such as 201 - Created with a location header?
[10:43:16] <kurtis> chilversc: Yeah, I was leaning towards HTTP Codes. something like this: { 'http': 201, 'job': <my job object>, 'redirect-url': '/some/url' }
[10:43:36] <kurtis> chilversc: But I didn't know if there was a more standardized way of formatting that json response
[10:44:06] <kurtis> Or ... I guess I could leave the http stuff out of the JSON and just set that as the headers
[10:44:06] <chilversc> kurtis: um, so you're putting a http status code in a json response over http?
[10:44:29] <kurtis> chilversc: I was :P But now you've got me thinking I should just set my headers appropriately :)
[10:45:21] <chilversc> so I was thinking; HTTP/1.1 201 Created; Location: /some/url then the body can contain the entity as well if you like
[10:45:33] <kurtis> chilversc: Yeah, I agree. that's probably the best way to go about it
[10:45:34] <kurtis> Thanks!
[10:46:03] <Nece228> hello
[10:46:22] <Nece228> why jquery outputs me [object Object]
[10:46:23] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/99648747
[10:46:25] <gnarf> any regexp wizards around?
[10:46:39] <gnarf> I want to match [A-Z] but not if its the first character
[10:47:14] <kurtis> gnarf: then do something like ![A-Z][A-Z]+
[10:47:22] <kurtis> (that's not the right syntax for regex of course)
[10:47:43] <gnarf> well - I'd prefer to only capture one character
[10:47:49] <Nece228> json.php outputs info with json_encode
[10:48:06] <kurtis> gnarf: What do you mean?
[10:48:45] <kurtis> gnarf: Maybe a combination of 'get the second character' and then regex match it?
[10:49:16] <kurtis> but you might as well run a regex on both, and just specify that the first character shouldn't be A-Z
[10:49:38] <gnarf> i suppose i could just /([^A-Z])([A-Z])/
[10:49:49] <tripodman> how can i check what number a certain jquery element is in a set that you get from a selection
[10:49:50] <gnarf> and deal with the extra capture group
[10:50:09] <kurtis> gnarf: Yeah, regex is usually pretty fast and optimized
[10:50:20] <kurtis> unless you're running it on rediculously huge strings
[10:50:51] <gnarf> im pretty aware of regexp performance issues :)
[10:51:02] <tripodman> shut down
[10:51:04] <tripodman> lmao
[10:51:05] <gnarf> just trying to think out of a box, your suggestion helped tho - thx
[10:51:57] <kurtis> haha
[10:52:49] <kurtis> np good luck to ya!
[10:53:01] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone im trying to do a compare like   if Users.count < 2  wich throw an undefined method `to_sym'
[10:53:12] <jarr0dsz> how could you sucessfully compare the 2?
[10:53:23] <jarr0dsz> already tried converting them to integer without success
[10:53:25] <jluedke> hey is there some magic to make this work <a href='javascript: $("someuniqueid").html("<b>hello</b>")'>click</a>
[10:53:27] <eddiemonge> ?index  @ tripodman
[10:53:38] <tripodman> eddiemonge: perfect
[10:53:42] <tripodman> tyvm
[10:53:44] <eddiemonge> tripodman: look at http://api.jquery.com/index
[10:54:04] <jarr0dsz> jluedke: you want to generate a unique id with JS why not use rails instead?
[10:54:09] <eddiemonge> jarr0dsz: what is Users?
[10:54:19] <jarr0dsz> eddiemonge: collection
[10:54:24] <jluedke> jarr0dsz: not making a unique id
[10:54:34] <djsounds02> anybody got a good tutorial for jQuery UI forms?
[10:54:41] <eddiemonge> jluedke: if ( Users.length < 2 ) {  }
[10:54:43] <jluedke> trying to just change the content of container with an id
[10:54:54] <eddiemonge> djsounds02: you mean other than the jqueryui.com/demos site?
[10:55:00] <jarr0dsz> eddiemonge: users.length?
[10:55:12] <eddiemonge> jarr0dsz: yes. javascript uses .lenght
[10:55:14] <jarr0dsz> i thought a .count was an integer but it seems not
[10:55:16] <blindMoe> I can't seem to get my callback ordering right on this.. it seems like the queue isn't being populated properly.  Can someone check it out and let me know if they see anything unusual?
[10:55:16] <eddiemonge> spelled correctly
[10:55:17] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/Sb5Cr/3/
[10:55:20] <jarr0dsz> undefined method `to_sym' is the result ;p
[10:55:22] <kurtis> jluedke: <a href="#" onclick="$('...').html('...')">Click</a>
[10:55:32] <blindMoe> The second div should stay and not .animate({'left': '100%'})
[10:56:00] <jluedke> kurtis: i was thinking that might be the case. using javascript: in the href seems to do somethign funky with theh dom
[10:56:05] <blindMoe> actually.. here is a better version: http://jsfiddle.net/Sb5Cr/4/
[10:56:09] <jluedke> trying to understand what.
[10:56:23] <kurtis> jluedke: Yeah, i'm not familiar with putting javascript in the href to be honest.
[10:56:28] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: i see a .live() in there
[10:56:40] <blindMoe> eddiemonge: yeah the items are loaded via ajax before this is called
[10:56:49] <jluedke> kurtis: an old trick
[10:56:57] <jluedke> times have a changed
[10:57:03] <eddiemonge> jluedke: eww. inline js
[10:57:17] <blindMoe> but that .live() is just for the <a>  ... it will be a .on() once I upgrade the jquery version throughout the entire site
[10:57:30] <eddiemonge> ok good
[10:57:42] <blindMoe> eddiemonge: do you see what I mean though?  That div should .animte({'left': 0}); and then stay
[10:57:48] <blindMoe> yet it animates back to left: 100%
[10:57:50] <kurtis> jluedke: Of course the jquery way of doing this would be to do something like: $('thatid').click(function() { $(this).html('...'); });
[10:57:56] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Sb5Cr/5/
[10:58:55] <blindMoe> eddiemonge: well.. kind of
[10:58:56] <jluedke> yeah, this is legacy code just looking for quick and dirty.
[10:59:03] <blindMoe> but I think it is the .animate() that is screwing up
[10:59:11] <blindMoe> and I need the 'slide' effect instead of fading
[11:00:56] <blindMoe> the thing that is weird is that the .animate({'left': 0}); is set in a callback from the .animate({'left': '100%'}); yet it seems to get called first like the function is not actually running it as a callback and instead queueing it up right away
[11:01:26] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: http://jsfiddle.net/Sb5Cr/6/
[11:01:42] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: you are calling the showAddPageOptions function instead of passing it in
[11:01:52] <blindMoe> oh crap
[11:01:56] <eddiemonge> showAdd() calls. showAdd passes it in
[11:01:57] <blindMoe> because of the ()  ?
[11:01:59] <blindMoe> oh man
[11:02:01] <blindMoe> thanks man :)
[11:02:08] * blindMoe buys eddiemonge a virtual beer
[11:02:24] <antgel_> hi all, i'm looking at using switchClass for a sidebar div that needs to change its content as well as its CSS attributes when the method is run.  is this feasible?  i haven't even got it working yet for the CSS attributes, but if I have two classes, thin-sidebar and expanded-sidebar, how can i get the content to alter when i go from one class to the other?
[11:02:27] <eddiemonge> or you could buy me a real one
[11:02:40] <blindMoe> eddiemonge: have a paypal account?
[11:02:50] <antgel_> please let me know if it doesn't make sense, 12 hours at the desk and this is my last work of the day :)
[11:02:53] <blindMoe> will buy you a 6 pack for the help you have given me over time
[11:03:50] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: i do. my first name @ my full name .com
[11:05:32] <JackBauer24> antgel_: use this: http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/ to change CSS class and this: http://api.jquery.com/html/ to read/set content
[11:07:00] <antgel_> JackBauer24: thanks.  sorry, i'm still new :)
[11:07:59] <eddiemonge> antgel_: thats fine. thats what we are here for. sometimes its just not knowing the correct verbiage
[11:08:11] <antgel_> :)
[11:08:50] <antgel_> yeah, i'm not new to software (well 25 years with computers since the 8-bit days), but i always find myself in roles where every month it's a new project, a new tech :)
[11:09:05] <eddiemonge> nothing wrong with that either
[11:09:57] <antgel_> when using the functions in http://api.jquery.com/html/, is it usual to put the replacement html in a variable in the .js file?  i'd kind of like to have it in my .html file but somehow hidden.  any links to good examples appreciated
[11:11:14] <galaxyAbstractor> hello
[11:11:26] <hashpuppy> i asked this earlier, but my question was a mess.  i've revised my question.  can someone help me write this plugin?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9569737/need-help-w-instance-variables-in-this-jquery-plugin
[11:13:09] <b-lew> Is there a way to start with item2 on this then scroll right and left depending on the selection of the user? http://ocp.delineamultimedia.com/HTML/horizontal.html
[11:14:19] <jarr0dsz> i tried *everything* i want to render a view in a before filter from applicationcontroller with http://pastie.org/3528075
[11:14:41] <eddiemonge> jarr0dsz: umm can haz jQuery?
[11:14:54] <jarr0dsz> it just throws an undefined method `empty?' for nil:NilClass every time what i do
[11:14:57] <jarr0dsz> jquery?
[11:15:30] <jarr0dsz> can't you render a view in a method called true a before filter or so
[11:15:36] <jarr0dsz> since this is really strange
[11:16:44] <b-lew> I guess what I'm asking is... is there a certain way to make an ID your default ID to start with?
[11:17:54] <eddiemonge> jarr0dsz: what is that? what language?
[11:18:08] <jarr0dsz> ah sorry wrong channel ;)
[11:18:11] <eddiemonge> b-lew: jquery 1.3.1?
[11:18:14] <jarr0dsz> completely missed that my bad, excuse
[11:18:17] <jarr0dsz> its ruby on rails eddiemonge
[11:18:24] <jarr0dsz> wrong channel paste
[11:18:41] <b-lew> I can update that eddiemonge.
[11:18:58] <b-lew> i just want to get this fixed before doing soo
[11:19:07] <eddiemonge> b-lew: id reverse that order
[11:19:19] <eddiemonge> update then fix. im a bit confused what you are asking for though
[11:20:03] <b-lew> well i basically want to have a center div then you can click an arrow that takes you right then you can click on that takes you left
[11:20:25] <b-lew> So I need the default id to be item 2 not item 1
[11:20:32] <b-lew> dose that make any more sense eddiemonge
[11:21:21] <b-lew> updated the jquery eddiemonge
[11:22:38] <antgel_> JackBauer24, eddiemonge: just wanted to say thanks a lot, switching class and content beautifully.  couldn't be more grateful :)
[11:22:59] <eddiemonge> b-lew: you have to paste the new link
[11:23:36] <b-lew> http://ocp.delineamultimedia.com/HTML/horizontal.html : eddiemonge
[11:24:31] <bartmax> good way to add dynamic property name to an object? like : data: { 'dynamicName' : value } ?
[11:24:56] <microhxo> Guys, i am trying to grab all my checkboxes and then iterate through them and create a json object for them that i can then send to a controller. It is not working at all though! Please take a look: http://paste2.org/p/1927860
[11:24:59] <eddiemonge> b-lew: i think you want .next() and .prev()
[11:25:27] <eddiemonge> bartmax: data["dynamicName"] = value
[11:25:40] <b-lew> yea, thats what i want
[11:25:45] <eddiemonge> ?serialize @ microhxo
[11:25:46] <bot-t> microhxo, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[11:26:11] <b-lew> and i want to start with a center id not the first one in the html so that it goes right and left not just right
[11:26:22] <bartmax> eddiemonge: this: data: { this[dName] :  $(dValue).val(), ... should work ?
[11:26:25] <tomasm-> hi, with jquery-ui dialog, is it possible to have them open in a 'tiled' fashion (adjacent) instead of 'cascading' (ie stacked) on top of each other? I would like something that works without needing configuration, maybe even for arbitrary # of windows
[11:26:48] <eddiemonge> bartmax: why you linking to spam? and you need .prop("checked")
[11:26:57] <tomasm-> I see stack: false, but am not sure what happens instead
[11:26:58] <galaxyAbstractor> I'm pretty new to jQuery (and suck at javascript at general, but I am doing trying to do something with $.get(url, function(response){}, response as I get is is the HTML DOM of the requested URL (on the same domain), but how would I use jQuery to get the content of a meta-tag in the response, like I would do $('meta[name=keywords]').attr('content') on the current page?
[11:27:14] <bartmax> eddiemonge: linking to spam ?
[11:27:19] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: thats not really what dialogs are for
[11:27:32] <eddiemonge> bartmax: i clicked, after 2 seconds the page redirects.
[11:27:47] <bartmax> eddiemonge: clicked what? never sent an url
[11:27:58] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: i think maybe you want http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#display-grid
[11:28:01] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, so there are other options for that kind of thing? this is a multi-user chat sstem
[11:28:05] <eddiemonge> bartmax: sorry. meant microhxo
[11:28:23] <microhxo> Thanks eddiemonge
[11:28:27] <eddiemonge> microhxo why you linking to spam? and you need .prop("checked")
[11:28:43] <eddiemonge> too many convos going. sheesh. im only human. right bot-t ?
[11:28:59] <microhxo> spam?
[11:29:05] <bartmax> wow
[11:29:10] <Nece228> hooray
[11:29:14] <Nece228> netsplits
[11:29:43] <tomasm-> galaxyAbstractor, why do you need to extract the meta keywords from the retreived document? have you thought about using a JSON (raw data stream) response rather than html? What else is the result content being used for?
[11:30:15] <bartmax> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/yxpx5/ <-- can you check at it, i don't know how to set in that situation
[11:30:27] <BoxTest> Hey I had a question about uploading images via jQuery. Now, I'm using the jquery.form plugin but for whatever the reason being it's not allowing me to upload images. I check the javascript error console and it says "jQuery is not defined". I tried using the FormData() but that didn't work either. I tried using a $.post('site.php',formdata); but that just didn't do anything. any help would be appreciated
[11:31:03] <Bogopimp> Thank you for your help #jQuery <3 :D
[11:31:06] <bartmax> BoxTest: jQuery is not defined is because you are not including the jQuery script BEFORE the call.
[11:31:08] <b-lew> woah
[11:31:10] <b-lew> crazy
[11:31:24] <eddiemonge> bartmax: that is missing a lot of info. so many undeclared variables
[11:31:35] <BoxTest> bartmax,  as in $(document.ready right?
[11:31:44] <galaxyAbstractor> tomasm- I'm fading between my page using http://css-tricks.com/dynamic-page-replacing-content/ and I want to change the title, keywords and description as the page changes
[11:31:46] <Nece228> can anyone explain me why this outputs me [object Object] and not the entries? thats my jquery code: http://paste.opensuse.org/61181594
[11:31:49] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: again, you need to include jquery.js
[11:32:00] <BoxTest> eddiemonge, I have
[11:32:07] <bartmax> eddiemonge: missing variables are there.. just the this[dName] does not work (dName is defined)
[11:32:10] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, the sortable grid sounds great, but technically each item is a 'window' that should have a title and a close button. hence the dialog box
[11:32:13] <Nece228> thats what json.php outputs: [{"name":"antras","date":"2012-03-05 20:41:09"}]
[11:32:15] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: andplacing it before the rest of your script?
[11:32:20] <bartmax> eddiemonge: there = on more code :D
[11:32:26] <BoxTest> yes
[11:32:33] <eddiemonge> bartmax: does this have a dName keyword?
[11:32:45] <BoxTest> $(document).ready(function (){ addimg()});
[11:32:49] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: you can do that with the sortable grid
[11:32:55] <bartmax> eddiemonge: yes. dName = 'idCountry'
[11:33:12] <bartmax> eddiemonge: comes from a $('data-autocomplete-dependencyName');
[11:33:23] <bartmax> attribute :D
[11:33:49] <eddiemonge> Nece228: where is that output?
[11:33:54] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, you mean the sortable grid AND the dialog? or the sortable grid can BE the dialog?
[11:34:18] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: no i mean, are you including that <script src="jquery.js"> before your other js code?
[11:34:29] <Nece228> eddiemonge: just empty page in which it outputs that text by using php's echo
[11:34:32] <bartmax> eddiemonge: im trying to do a generic add-on for jqueryui autocomplete for dependency autocomplete inputs, so if you have a dependency IdCountry, it will check for that value before doing the select.
[11:34:36] <eddiemonge> bartmax: hard to know without a working example
[11:34:49] <b-lew> man I don't think this is possible
[11:34:50] <BoxTest> eddiemonge, yes.
[11:34:50] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: i mean have the sortable grid with buttons that can act as close
[11:34:55] <tomasm-> galaxyAbstractor, with your $.get() call, you get the html content back into a variable for the callback... I believe you can do this; $(data).find('meta[...]')
[11:35:05] <bartmax> mm.. ok i got blackout so my desktop computer is off now, i'll paste the full code when power comes back so :D
[11:35:06] <spersaud> I want to show some images when a user mouse overs a div .. and follow the cursor how can I do this effect ?
[11:35:13] <eddiemonge> bartmax:  i think you are trying to create a layout template with something thats not really made for that yet
[11:35:25] <eddiemonge> ? demo @ Nece228
[11:35:26] <tomasm-> galaxyAbstractor, as long as you wrap the html content around $(), then it turns it into a DOM node, even if it's detached from the doc
[11:35:31] <BoxTest> eddiemonge,  I got rid of the error  jus moved it below a .js file and it seemed to remove the error. but it's still not uploading the form
[11:35:51] <em0vskangoura> Hey guys could i have some assistance with jQuery ?
[11:36:19] <eddiemonge> spersaud: look at tooltip plugins
[11:36:35] <Nece228> eddiemonge: i dont think demo is necessary, because when the json.php has this output: {"name":"antras","date":"2012-03-05 20:41:09"} my jquery works fine, but when it gets this output: [{"name":"antras","date":"2012-03-05 20:41:09"}], it doesnt output it
[11:36:50] <Nece228> eddiemonge: square brackets is the reason
[11:36:58] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: you might want to read some intro to javascript books to help you understand why its probably not working
[11:37:04] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ em0vskangoura
[11:37:05] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, ah, ok, I see, just put in the titlebar/close button myself.
[11:37:36] <em0vskangoura> Yea i am trying to code a module in Drupal, and i am using jQuery to implement ajax Database updating..
[11:37:51] <em0vskangoura> my question is how will i make it dynamic
[11:38:02] <em0vskangoura> Lets suppose that for every name-record in my Database
[11:38:08] <em0vskangoura> i create a form with a button
[11:38:14] <eddiemonge> Nece228: those are two different things. one is a JSON object and the second is a JSON array of objects
[11:38:18] <galaxyAbstractor> tomasm- so like $(response).find('meta[name=keywords]').attr('content');?
[11:38:20] <em0vskangoura> so i have multiple forms.. And iu give to each button one ID
[11:38:35] <BoxTest> eddiemonge, because ajax doesn't support image uploading. according to this one site. but according to this site plugin it works. also it doesn't even do th ajax request..
[11:38:42] <em0vskangoura> Like i got button1, button2, button3 depending on how many my records are
[11:38:43] <Nece228> eddiemonge: yeah, so how to fix this?
[11:38:47] <BoxTest> eddiemonge,  looking at it using firebug
[11:38:49] <eddiemonge> galaxyAbstractor: yes
[11:39:05] <microhxo> $('.ui-accordion-content-active .checkedGridRead')  grabs me all checkboxes inside of the class ui-accordion-content-active which have the class .checkedGridRead..  I want to now grab ALL checkboxes inside the class ui-accordion-content-active , so i assumed: var checkboxes = $('.ui-accordion-content-active input:checkbox') would work but it grabs EVERYTHING, even if its not in ui-accordion-conten
[11:39:07] <microhxo> t-active..
[11:39:08] <galaxyAbstractor> hmmm, putting that in an alert() alerts undefined
[11:39:08] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: ajax doesnt really support file uploading without an iframe hack
[11:39:14] <em0vskangoura> So with jQuery what i do is.. to check if a button id is clicked and then show up a div
[11:39:21] <galaxyAbstractor> though I know the element exists in the document being fetched
[11:39:21] <eddiemonge> Nece228: decide what type of JSON you want returned then work with that
[11:39:43] <tomasm-> galaxyAbstractor, probably
[11:39:47] <em0vskangoura> But i need to make that dynamic because at the moment i have the same code copy pasted 5 times with just different IDs
[11:40:01] <eddiemonge> microhxo: are you sure?
[11:40:03] <Nece228> eddiemonge: so thats json encoding problem, and not jquery. thanks for info, ill dig into it
[11:40:19] <eddiemonge> galaxyAbstractor: console.log( response )
[11:40:22] <galaxyAbstractor> I can get the title using regex, that was my first idea, like document.title = (/<title>(.*?)<\/title>/m).exec(response)[1];, but I'm pretty sure you aren't supposed to do anything like that
[11:40:37] <tomasm-> galaxyAbstractor, if you have firebug, you can test this out in the browser, to experiment
[11:40:51] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: can you make an example of what you have see ? demo
[11:40:56] <tomasm-> galaxyAbstractor, NOOOOOO!! don't use regex when you can use DOM/xpath
[11:41:06] <galaxyAbstractor> that's what I mean
[11:41:12] <rob_> hi
[11:41:14] <galaxyAbstractor> that's why I want to use jQuery :P
[11:41:14] <eddiemonge> Nece228: not json encoding problem. its a problem of you sending one thing and trying to work with a different thing
[11:41:15] <em0vskangoura> eddiemoge: What do you mean?
[11:41:23] <eddiemonge> Nece228: both json responses are valid
[11:41:27] <BoxTest> eddiemonge, http://www.9lessons.info/2011/08/ajax-image-upload-without-refreshing.html
[11:41:54] <Nece228> eddiemonge: sorry, im really bad at javascript and jquery, so i dont know what to change in it
[11:42:02] <rob_> i have 'this' is an li and im doing .closest('ol').children().length to try and find how many li elements there are in the ol but i always seem to get '1', can anyone tell me what's up?
[11:42:05] <microhxo> eddiemonge: Im pretty sure.  Because i see only 20 checkboxes on that page. But when i do var checkboxes = $('.ui-accordion-content-active input:checkbox').serialize();   I get this: http://pastebin.com/TdnsUy7y
[11:42:05] <eddiemonge> galaxyAbstractor: live link example?
[11:42:25] <eddiemonge> BoxTest: whats that?
[11:42:47] <eddiemonge> ?mdc for loop @ Nece228
[11:42:47] <caniuse> eddiemonge: for - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for
[11:43:00] <galaxyAbstractor> eddiemonge: http://nas.pixomania.net:90/projekt/ (Press About Me)
[11:43:04] <BoxTest> eddiemonge,  showing you that you can upload images.  Basically the jquery form plugin creates an iframe for you and uploads it that way,
[11:43:39] <smo_> is it to find children children with a css style?
[11:43:44] <smo_> is it possible **
[11:43:58] <eddiemonge> rob_: why not use siblings?
[11:44:31] <rob_> eddiemonge: im a bit new, what is the difference?
[11:44:33] <eddiemonge> microhxo: thats not right. but i cant tell without an example
[11:44:46] <em0vskangoura> Here is my jQuery code.. http://pastebin.com/taJxV0rS
[11:45:22] <em0vskangoura> I know that title1, title2, title3 could be in a function.. but i need it dynamic
[11:45:22] <microhxo> I know its not, it is grabbing EVERY checkbox on that page which is quite a few, the ones present in accordion-content-active are 20 exactly.
[11:45:41] <rob_> eddiemonge: using .siblings().length returns 0
[11:46:44] <Nece228> eddiemonge: should .each() do the same thing?
[11:46:52] <eddiemonge> galaxyAbstractor: add console.log( $(response) );
[11:47:01] <DonSilver> hi folks fairly new to jQuery and i try to get firm with accordion it works very well but i have a little issue which i would resolve. i got it working to load the content of an accordion div via an ajax request. but the div opens and no content is displayed (its loading) and then the content is displayed and the div pops to its full size. is it possible to animate this or wait with the opening until the ajax request is finished?
[11:47:07] <eddiemonge> rob_: a lot less calls
[11:47:14] <eddiemonge> rob_: are you sure you are in the li ?
[11:47:20] <galaxyAbstractor> done
[11:47:34] <eddiemonge> Nece228: possibly but why use it when a simple for loop is far faster and better?
[11:47:40] <galaxyAbstractor> a lot of <TextNode> things in the console
[11:48:00] <rzec> what happens if with a jqueryui widget, I try to call a method that does not exist like : .tabs( "doesNotExist" ) : ?
[11:48:10] <eddiemonge> galaxyAbstractor: now do console.log( $(response).find("meta")
[11:48:24] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ rzec
[11:48:35] <vl4kn0> How do I stop blur event handler from being executed?
[11:48:39] <rob_> eddiemonge: im further down the tree than li which is why i did .closest('ol').chjildren('li').length;
[11:49:03] <galaxyAbstractor> eddiemonge yeah, it's empty, []
[11:49:04] <rob_> eddiemonge: and im not sure why that doesn't work
[11:49:54] <rzec> eddiemongo: ?tias? | galaxyAbstractor: so it should return []?
[11:50:50] <galaxyAbstractor> rzec no, there is <meta> tags in the response when it's logged to the console like console.log( response )
[11:51:02] <galaxyAbstractor> it's those which I try to find
[11:51:58] <galaxyAbstractor> rob_ chjildren('li') should that j be there?
[11:52:02] <galaxyAbstractor> :P
[11:52:28] <rob_> typo since i typed it into irc
[11:52:32] <galaxyAbstractor> ahh
[11:53:25] <rob_> oh i see why it's not working heh
[11:55:43] <eddiemonge> galaxyAbstractor: this is so dirty and im not sure why it works but $( $(response)[0].parentNode).children("meta[name=keywords]").attr("content")
[11:55:54] <DonSilver> is it possible to animate the resizing of a accordion tab when ajax content is loaded?
[11:56:17] <soc42> ok
[11:56:24] <DonSilver> currently it pops to its needed size but i like to have it fading.
[11:57:21] <soc42> while i didn't manage to reload the complete deep-browsing post page, i re-thinked the problem and did a simple jquery update of the opener html piece, which had to be updated according to the popups' status
[11:57:37] <galaxyAbstractor> eddiemonge heh yeah that seems to work
[11:57:50] <galaxyAbstractor> I'll have to read up a bit about that :P
[11:59:23] <microhxo> How can i get all checkboxes that are inside of a specific class?
[11:59:52] <microhxo> var checkboxes = $('input:checkbox.myclass').serialize() returns every checkbox on the whole page..
[12:00:06] <Guest91701> I need some serious assistance with jquery mobile
[12:00:17] <eddiemonge> microhxo: i dont think you ever did a demo did you?
[12:00:39] <snover> sorry, we only give flippant assistance with that
[12:01:04] <microhxo> eddiemonge: its not possible because i am using telerik grids that contain serverside templates of checkboxes.  Cant do a live demo.
[12:02:11] <Tman> I am using jQuery Mobile 1.0.1 and one of my list links to another page, but I cannot get $("#viewtour").live('pageinit', function() { to fire
[12:02:28] <eddiemonge> microhxo: do a simplified demo that we can diagnose because $(".class input:checkbox") should only get the checkboxes that are descendants of that class
[12:02:44] <soc42> what about jquery timing...
[12:02:55] <microhxo> the .serialize is what seems to be making everything
[12:03:10] <soc42> how can i determine if a jquery-function needs more time to execute before the window closes?
[12:04:26] <microhxo> eddiemonge: scratch that, $(".class input:checkbox")  grabs everything..
[12:05:45] <soc42> if i set a right self.close() after the jquery func to update the opener window, the opener won't get updated
[12:05:55] <soc42> -a
[12:06:17] <eddiemonge> microhxo: it shouldnt. check what .class by itself is returning. you might be surprised
[12:06:28] <joshsmith> are there any jQuery validators that work really well out of the box with Bootstrap?
[12:06:35] <eddiemonge> soc42: whats the jq funct?
[12:06:43] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: validators?
[12:06:51] * joshsmith wishes there was something like node toolbox here
[12:07:05] <joshsmith> eddiemonge: yeah, form validation
[12:07:27] <eddiemonge> besides the officially unofficial jquery validation plugin?
[12:07:30] <joshsmith> I wrote my own custom stuff but I'm upgrading to Bootstrap 2 and I'd have to modify that a lot
[12:07:38] <soc42> eddiemonge: it's  window.opener.jQuery("#foo").attr("disabled", "disabled");
[12:08:02] <joshsmith> eddiemonge: yeah, besides that one. and I always seem to have trouble tracking down a recent project page for that
[12:08:27] <soc42> it works fine, if i leave out the self.close(), but not while it is set?
[12:08:28] <joshsmith> I always get the bassistance.de page (is that the same one?)
[12:08:34] <eddiemonge> soc42: use .prop()
[12:08:43] <soc42> is faster?
[12:08:48] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: thats who wrote it
[12:09:02] <eddiemonge> soc42: is correct
[12:09:41] <eddiemonge> ?prop @ soc42
[12:10:01] <eddiemonge> bot-t died again? argh
[12:10:12] <eddiemonge> soc42: http://api.jquery.com/prop
[12:10:37] <joshsmith> eddiemonge: this looks helpful https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/202
[12:10:38] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #202 on bootstrap, reported by Tornth (5m, 3w ago): Validator Plugin for Bootstrap
[12:11:28] <eddiemonge> i am so over twitter bootstrap
[12:11:39] <eddiemonge> i wish more people in here were like blindMoe
[12:11:59] <blindMoe> cause you would ahve more beers? ;)
[12:12:51] <eddiemonge> id have more burritos
[12:13:02] <eddiemonge> and be a happy coder
[12:13:08] <soc42> eddiemonge: well, i changed to  window.opener.jQuery("#foo").prop("disabled");  // but without any effect
[12:13:08] <blindMoe> hehe
[12:13:32] <blindMoe> have you been to El Burrito Express out in the sunset district?
[12:13:38] <eddiemonge> soc42: that wont do anything. .prop("disabled", true)
[12:13:49] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: no
[12:13:55] <blindMoe> its worth the trip
[12:15:08] <muka> hi! I'm thinking of use jquery ui 1.9m6 in development. It's really a bad idea?
[12:15:27] <soc42> eddiemonge: self.close() is still too fast... ???
[12:16:05] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ soc42
[12:16:10] <soc42> as i leave self.close() out, the .prop thing works similar to .attr()
[12:16:49] <soc42> well, how can i jsfiddle an opener/popup-scenario?
[12:17:17] <eddiemonge> easily
[12:17:41] <em0vskangoura> eddiemonge: did you check my pastebin ?
[12:18:11] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: no. whats the link? and it shouldnt have pastebin in it
[12:19:28] <em0vskangoura> eddiemonge: here it is http://pastebin.com/taJxV0rS
[12:19:36] <eddiemonge> ugh
[12:19:49] <soc42> eddiemonge: this is the js that works within the popup without the last line to close the window, see:  http://jsfiddle.net/2MLMa/
[12:20:10] <soc42> http://jsfiddle.net/2MLMa/1/
[12:21:29] <eddiemonge> soc42: that self.close is in the wrong place. it should be after the .props
[12:21:38] <soc42> maybe it helps if i put the self.close() within the jQuery(document).ready()...
[12:21:45] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: what are you trying to do
[12:21:47] <soc42> that's what i wanted to say ;o)
[12:22:22] <em0vskangoura> I have a database.. for each record in my table i show up a button. So in this code you see that i have 3 titles so 3 buttons
[12:22:37] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: what do you think toggle does?
[12:22:41] <em0vskangoura> For each button i hide - show a div which is just a textfield for ajax editing.
[12:22:49] <em0vskangoura> clicking
[12:23:10] <eddiemonge> api.jquery.com/toggle
[12:23:21] <soc42> yup, that's it!
[12:23:32] <em0vskangoura> i use toggle on a checkbox
[12:23:36] <soc42> eddiemonge++
[12:23:40] <em0vskangoura> not button sorry
[12:23:42] <eddiemonge> soc42: literally just had a talk about this in #jquery-dev
[12:23:56] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: again, what do you think .toggle() does? read the docs for it
[12:24:13] <em0vskangoura> eddimonge: My problem isnt on toggle :P
[12:24:36] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: i believe it is
[12:24:41] <eddiemonge> since you arent using it correctly
[12:24:49] <em0vskangoura> eddiemonge: Ok i will read it again
[12:25:00] <soc42> eddiemonge: well, can you explain why or how to troubleshoot situations like this in the future?
[12:25:13] <muka> Hi, is too early to use jquery ui 1.9 ?
[12:25:42] <eddiemonge> soc42: you were closing the window before the the dom was ready so the code in the .ready block wasnt firing
[12:27:07] <em0vskangoura> eddiemonge: Ok it hides unhides elements, but yet this one works for me.
[12:27:10] <soc42> eddiemonge: k, well explained
[12:27:21] <eddiemonge> muka: for production? yes. for testing? no
[12:27:41] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: it seems like you are trying to use it as an event handler
[12:28:17] <em0vskangoura> eddiemonge: What i want to do is to have an html checkbox or button, When its clicked once i show up the textfield
[12:28:23] <em0vskangoura> If clicked again i hide it
[12:28:28] <eddiemonge> api.jquery.com/change
[12:28:32] <em0vskangoura> But i want this stuff dynamic
[12:28:43] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: ok then use event delegation using .on()
[12:28:59] <muka> ok thanks
[12:29:31] <em0vskangoura> eddiemonge: COuld you explain me more? WHat i want to do is to have a Database but if a new record is added
[12:29:48] <em0vskangoura> i will have one more new div+button which will be automanaged by jQuery
[12:32:13] <eddiemonge> em0vskangoura: read api.jquery.com/on especially the delegation part
[12:32:28] <em0vskangoura> eddiemonge: Ok thanks a lot :)
[12:36:00] <Chopps> hi guys, i need your help, i have a select elem with 2 options, that select gets populated according to the selection made on another select element, the thing is if you populate  the element once, and select another option, the previous options are still in there and the new ones get appended to them, is there any way to remove the previous added options and just leave the default options set
[12:36:00] <Chopps> on the html??
[12:36:12] <Chopps> here is the code i have atm: http://jsfiddle.net/sWCyN/
[12:36:36] <Eviltwin> Look up .empty on the docs
[12:37:14] <Chopps> Eviltwin but if i use empty it will erase everything from the select, i want to keep the 2 default options set on the html
[12:37:53] <Eviltwin> Then use .children().slice(2).remove()
[12:38:53] <em0vskangoura> eddiemonge: Could u assist me a bit more on change() . WHat i tried is something like this: $('#select').change( function for show here).change( hide it here )
[12:40:04] <opie_> em0vskangoura: think of it like .change() adds an event to fire everytime it changes.  Your example code would run a function to hide it and then show it every time it changes
[12:40:12] <Chopps> awesome Eviltwin, works wonders, thank you
[12:41:00] <opie_> em0vskangoura: make your change event turn it off if it's on and on if it's off. combine the "function to show" and "function to hide" into one function with logic that checks which to do
[12:41:49] <em0vskangoura> opie: Hmm you mean that ill check something like : Is it hidden then show it, else hide it
[12:42:03] <Ghan> evenin'
[12:42:05] <em0vskangoura> opie: Is that the only way ? I tried also like having 2 functions
[12:42:19] <opie_> ?toggle @ em0vskangoura
[12:42:19] <bot-t> em0vskangoura, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[12:42:34] <em0vskangoura> So the 1st one will be executed for first time and if triggered again the second one will be executed and the third time the 1st onem
[12:42:36] <Ghan> could anyone please tell me why this won't work? http://jsfiddle.net/xp3YJ/1/
[12:43:24] <Dave_Stein> anyone have experience with jasmine-jquery plugin?
[12:43:36] <Woet> ?ask @ Dave_Stein
[12:43:36] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:43:51] <opie_> Ghan: i think it works, i think your expectations are incorrect, what do YOU think it should do?
[12:43:52] <Dave_Stein> :)
[12:44:13] <Ghan> i think it should change the color of the link
[12:44:16] <Ghan> opie_:
[12:44:17] <Dave_Stein> when I use jasmine-jquery and do addFixtures('test.html'); it will randomly error out with: During Page reloaded unexpectedly during or after null triggered by beforeunload
[12:44:22] <jeffpal> Anyone know something like "jQuery Cookie Plugion" that is active?"
[12:44:24] <Dave_Stein> which then throws a browser panic exception
[12:44:30] <opie_> Ghan: it does but since it's visited, it sets to the browser purple
[12:44:43] <opie_> that's what you're seeing?
[12:44:47] <Dave_Stein> i guess that would happen if it was 404ing cause my paths are wrong but its happening randomly so i cant get a reliable .. anything
[12:45:19] <Dave_Stein> im using js test driver actually which is throwing the error, which only happens with jquery-jasmine
[12:45:25] <Ghan> no opie_
[12:45:33] <em0vskangoura> bot-t && opie: So i could call it like this: jQuery("#MyButtonsID").change().toggle( function() ...
[12:45:44] <Ghan> i just want it so that if the div contains CHANGED the link turns red
[12:45:45] <Ghan> or bold
[12:45:50] <FunnyLookinHat> Ghan, dom structure is incorrect
[12:45:50] <Ghan> or something else
[12:45:59] <Shambat> I'm looking at some ajax calls that are taking some time to finish. In my success handler for the $.ajax() calls I am doing a lot of calculations and parsing. Does this affect the completion time of the whole request?
[12:46:12] <Ghan> is it searching for .upload inside the div?
[12:46:15] <FunnyLookinHat> Ghan, yeah
[12:46:17] <opie_> ohh Ghan: http://jsfiddle.net/xp3YJ/1/
[12:46:28] <opie_> ?next @ Ghan
[12:46:29] <bot-t> Ghan, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[12:46:33] <FunnyLookinHat> Yup
[12:46:35] <opie_> find does children, homie
[12:46:42] <Ghan> ah
[12:46:44] <Ghan> :D
[12:46:46] <FunnyLookinHat> Ghan, or put it into the div - which might be what you meant?  :D
[12:46:58] <opie_> yeah, i changed it to next. Either works
[12:47:11] <Ghan> thnx you both!
[12:51:50] <opie_> Ghan: btw.  when i think something isn't working  this setup http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboudreau/xp3YJ/2/ and firebug are an unstoppable debugger
[12:52:20] <Ghan> thnx
[12:52:27] <Ghan> more a PHP man :D
[12:52:49] <opie_> yeah, debugger; is imho one of the least used native js methods
[13:09:06] <hashpuppy> i have class="view-normal, view-block".  and then some class="view-block".  i want to select all where .view-block AND NOT .view-normal.  is this possible?  $(".view-block:not(.view-normal)") doesn't seem to work
[13:10:54] <bonhoffer> i want to pull json from a local directory . . . any idea why i get:  Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP.
[13:11:15] <styol> hashpuppy: hmm seems like it should work, but perhaps try .not() instead? not sure
[13:15:00] <N0way> Hi
[13:15:34] <hashpuppy> http://jsfiddle.net/n8cFN/
[13:15:44] <hashpuppy> styol: can't get that
[13:15:56] <drale2k> when i do $('video').first() i get an object returned. Any chance to get the element as a string instead of a object ?
[13:16:05] <drale2k> like "<video .... "
[13:16:23] <hashpuppy> i want it to print "block only;"
[13:16:29] <styol> hashpuppy: there shouldn't be a , in the class=""
[13:16:48] <hashpuppy> freak
[13:16:56] <hashpuppy> thanks, styol
[13:17:00] <styol> no problem
[13:17:23] <JackBauer24> drale2k: why would you want to do that?
[13:17:54] <drale2k> JackBauer24: i want to cache the element with all ots attributes (src and poster) in localstorage
[13:17:54] <N0way> What is the best templating engine with jquery ?
[13:19:27] <JackBauer24> drale2k: I'm not sure if it's possible to get a HTML tag string, but you can read the needed attributes and make a string yourself
[13:19:57] <drale2k> JackBauer24: yeah i thought maybe i can just read it out
[13:21:32] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/Yi6LhAkKeQwf5c2xcZfsTr is giving an error in console--> $("input:checkbox").each(checkValue).on is not a function
[13:23:09] <Woet> ?demo @ raj
[13:23:09] <bot-t> raj, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:26:25] <drij> is it considered okay practice to use standard events on non-DOM objects? like myobj={}; $(myobj).change(function () { ... });?
[13:27:01] <raj> Woet, how do i replicate console.log?
[13:27:15] <raj> here, http://jsfiddle.net/7AJG5/
[13:28:37] <nFFF> raj, what do you mean?
[13:28:53] <nFFF> drij, sure
[13:29:03] <raj> well, console.log is showing me this error--> $("input:checkbox").each(checkValue).on is not a function
[13:29:13] <raj> i dunno why
[13:30:19] <Woet> raj: you didn't even select jquery on the left of jsfiddle
[13:30:31] <Woet> gotta go.
[13:31:20] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/7AJG5/3/
[13:31:25] <raj> i don't see how that's making a difference
[13:31:39] <anthony_> Could someone help me out with styling a select drop down menu?
[13:32:06] <styol> raj: you've got a basic syntax error that you can see when you load, check /2/
[13:32:24] <raj> where is the error shown?
[13:32:28] <styol> in console
[13:32:30] <N0way> I have seen that the jquery-tmpl plugin is not maintained anymore
[13:32:41] <raj> N0way, it's not
[13:32:43] <N0way> Should I use the new tempalte plugin by Microsoft ?
[13:32:52] <N0way> What is the best solution now ?
[13:33:00] <raj> you can check out JSRender and JSSomething else as a replacement
[13:33:09] <dame_dudder> howdy guys
[13:33:19] <dame_dudder> got a quick one
[13:33:20] <raj> JSViews
[13:33:24] <dame_dudder> check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/RN3M5/
[13:33:34] <N0way> raj: ok thanks
[13:33:41] <dame_dudder> I want the toggleClass to work on all LIs
[13:33:46] <dame_dudder> it only works on the first one
[13:34:00] <raj> N0way, it's made by the same guy that built JQuery-tmpl
[13:34:18] <dame_dudder> not sure what i'm doing wrong.
[13:34:45] <raj> styol, i have no errors in console for /2
[13:35:00] <styol> raj: yah thats the working one, check the others, like the one you just most recently posted and the original
[13:35:08] <b-lew> Can Someone help me. I need to figure out a way for this to start on number 2 and move left to get to number oneâ€¦ is that possible? http://ocp.delineamultimedia.com/HTML/horizontal.html
[13:35:22] <styol> working as in free from errors, it logs something to the console but not sure if its working as you expect
[13:35:26] <drij> nFFF: thanks
[13:36:36] <styol> dame_dudder: only a single item highlights for me, but perhaps instead of $(this).siblings().removeClass('selected'); you can do $(".view_list_header li").removeClass('selected');
[13:37:16] <dame_dudder> styol: that part works fine for me
[13:37:21] <dame_dudder> the part that doesn't work is
[13:37:28] <dame_dudder> I want the word "hello" to appear on other list items
[13:37:33] <dame_dudder> the toggleClass part
[13:37:43] <dame_dudder> it only appears on the first one
[13:37:49] <raj> styol, still doesn't send checked_items to console.log http://jsfiddle.net/7AJG5/6/
[13:39:21] <dame_dudder> basically it's only toggling one time.. this part $(this).toggleClass('desc');
[13:39:28] <JillesCode> Guys I have a link with 2 icons (images) in it (edit and delete) how would I keep the hover effect, even on hovering those images?
[13:39:30] <dame_dudder> on the first item
[13:39:39] <raj> styol, I don't know why it's saying $("input:checkbox").each(checkValue).on is not a function
[13:39:42] <raj> [Break On This Error]
[13:39:55] <raj> in my live code
[13:40:20] <zduffy> Can someone help me understand why the country gets selected but not the state? http://jsfiddle.net/UBWvk/7/
[13:40:53] <styol> dame_dudder: use .live('click' instead of click( on both
[13:41:04] <dame_dudder> styol: trying now..
[13:41:29] <dame_dudder> can I use the .on  instead?
[13:41:38] <ParadoxQuine> dame_dudder: yea use on instead of live
[13:41:44] <ParadoxQuine> in jq 1.7+
[13:41:46] <dame_dudder> ok
[13:41:52] <dame_dudder> right i just found out about that today
[13:42:03] <styol> raj: its not saying that for me, but maybe move the function before the each that calls the function
[13:42:11] <ParadoxQuine> zduffy: what do you mean? i just tried it and when i selected USA it autoselected alabama
[13:42:39] <raj> hmm...k. Although I thought the point of a function was so i didn't have to do that :)
[13:42:42] <b-lew> can I score some jquery help?
[13:43:01] <raj> same thing after moving it
[13:43:05] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: in irc, you generally just ask your q. the answer to the one you posted is always "yes" :)
[13:43:15] <dame_dudder> styol, ParadoxQuine: tried it still only on first one
[13:43:16] <dame_dudder> http://jsfiddle.net/RN3M5/3/
[13:43:20] <b-lew> ^ i already asked
[13:43:21] <b-lew> heh
[13:43:39] <b-lew> Is there a way to have this functionality start on #2 then go left for number 1 and right for number 3?
[13:43:42] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: must've asked before i joined, want to repeat?
[13:43:45] <dame_dudder> the remove and add class are working as expected
[13:43:49] <dame_dudder> but .toggle isn't
[13:43:55] <styol> dame_dudder: live not on
[13:43:59] <ParadoxQuine> dame_dudder: looking
[13:44:00] <b-lew> hold up
[13:44:07] <zduffy> ParadoxQuine: I want united states to be automatically selected, and when that happens you cannot select state
[13:44:12] <styol> dame_dudder: also missing closing ' on the first 'click'
[13:44:12] <dame_dudder> styol: i read today that .live is deprecated
[13:44:14] <NoiseEee> styol: uhhh no.
[13:44:19] <styol> ah i didnt know, sorry
[13:44:23] <dame_dudder> http://jsfiddle.net/RN3M5/4/
[13:44:38] <styol> im stuck with old versions of jquery anyway in most scenarios haha
[13:44:44] <dame_dudder> :) no worries
[13:44:56] <raj`> styol, sorry, got disconnected
[13:44:56] <dame_dudder> added missing '
[13:44:59] <dame_dudder> still
[13:45:03] <ParadoxQuine> dame_dudder: in order for it to dynamically bind, you have to pick an element that won't be dynamically added/removed, and then use a sub-selector to select what you want to dynamically bind to
[13:45:09] <NoiseEee> dame_dudder: http://jsfiddle.net/RN3M5/5/
[13:45:44] <dame_dudder> NoiseEee: that part works fine
[13:45:57] <Blaster> hi i'm trying to send an email through a GET query string using jQuery.  If an email has a literal plus in it how can I still send it through the request without being encoded as a space?
[13:45:57] <dame_dudder> I want the word 'hello' to be added after it's selected
[13:45:59] <dame_dudder> and toggled
[13:46:07] <NoiseEee> 'toggled'?
[13:46:20] <dame_dudder> $(this).toggleClass('desc');
[13:46:33] <itsgreen> How do I run a function on a display change?
[13:46:41] <dame_dudder> after you click an LI, it adds the class .desc
[13:46:51] <dame_dudder> specifically to first item only..
[13:46:55] <dame_dudder> i want it on all
[13:47:12] <dame_dudder> trying to understand what ParadoxQuine just said...
[13:47:30] <NoiseEee> dame_dudder: http://jsfiddle.net/RN3M5/7/
[13:47:34] <ParadoxQuine> dame_dudder: example
[13:47:34] <ParadoxQuine> http://jsfiddle.net/RN3M5/4/
[13:47:41] <ParadoxQuine> probably not what you want, but probably closer
[13:47:56] <ParadoxQuine> huh that url didnt update
[13:48:08] <dame_dudder> :)
[13:48:10] <ParadoxQuine> there we go
[13:48:23] <ParadoxQuine> or not
[13:48:31] <ParadoxQuine> i havent shared jsfiddles much...hm
[13:48:57] <dame_dudder> NoiseEee: it's adding the class but not toggling the classes
[13:49:05] <dame_dudder> or adding or removing the .desc
[13:49:09] <NoiseEee> dame_dudder: sure it is
[13:49:15] <ParadoxQuine> there we go
[13:49:15] <ParadoxQuine> http://jsfiddle.net/RN3M5/9/
[13:49:42] <dame_dudder> bingo!

[13:50:12] <dame_dudder> thanks ParadoxQuine
[13:50:15] <dame_dudder> thanks styol
[13:50:19] <dame_dudder> much appreciated
[13:50:20] <ParadoxQuine> sure thing
[13:50:36] <dame_dudder> question
[13:50:43] <dame_dudder> what's difference between
[13:50:46] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: not sure what you mean
[13:50:49] <dame_dudder> $('.view_list_header').on('click', 'li.selected',
[13:50:59] <dame_dudder> and $('.view_list_header li.selected').on('click',
[13:51:17] <ParadoxQuine> the second says "select these elements" and then "on any of them clicked, do this..."
[13:51:21] <b-lew> ParadoxQuine: Welll right now its starting on item1 and i really want it to start on item 2 when you first get to the page
[13:51:41] <dame_dudder> got it
[13:52:01] <ParadoxQuine> while the second says "select these elements" (the list header only though) and "whenever a click occurs on a li.selected within these elements, do this..."
[13:52:02] <microhxo> How can i check a string and see if it starts with a specific word?
[13:52:24] <ParadoxQuine> microhxo: indexOf
[13:52:47] <dame_dudder> got a few more
[13:52:53] <dame_dudder> is .on still necessary?
[13:53:02] <dame_dudder> and does any of it bubble up
[13:53:33] <ParadoxQuine> it is if the sub elements (the second arg to on()) are dynamically created/deleted/changed
[13:53:45] <ParadoxQuine> and it will all bubble up with correct target, yep
[13:54:18] <b-lew> does that make sense
[13:54:45] <ParadoxQuine> technically on("click", "subselector"... is the same as saying $("parentElement").click(function (event) { if event.target would be matched by the subselector, do this...
[13:54:50] <ParadoxQuine> dame_dudder: does that make sense?
[13:55:25] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: ok let me look at your code
[13:55:35] <dame_dudder> ParadoxQuine: kind of
[13:55:44] <dame_dudder> would it work if i did
[13:55:45] <dame_dudder> $('.view_list_header').click('li.selected',
[13:55:55] <dame_dudder> instead?
[13:56:05] <ParadoxQuine> i dont think so, but only becuause jquery doesn't have that version of click written
[13:56:06] <dame_dudder> i'm just curious now.. though we have everything working
[13:56:22] <dame_dudder> ah i see
[13:56:43] <ParadoxQuine> the subselector stuff works for on() only, though there's no technical reason why it couldn't work for click() hover() and every other convenience method
[13:56:54] <ParadoxQuine> afaik
[13:57:07] <dame_dudder> gotcha
[13:58:11] <raj> styol, do I need to call checkValue() perhaps? --> $('input:checkbox').each(checkValue()).on('change', checkValue());
[13:58:57] <Shambat> I'm looking at some ajax calls that are taking some time to finish. In my success handler for the $.ajax() calls I am doing a lot of calculations and parsing. Does this affect the completion time of the whole request?
[13:59:31] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: so why not just select pane 2 on document ready?
[13:59:52] <raj> styol, http://71.232.89.204:8080/test
[13:59:58] <b-lew> well i'm not for sure how to do thatâ€¦ #noob
[14:00:22] <JillesCode> Guys, I have this "console.log($(this).parent());" and it logs <li> <img etcetc /> <a href="#">THIS DATA</a></li>, now I need to have 'THIS DATA' (between a tags) as a var, how would I do this?
[14:01:27] <scheiko> $(this).parent().find('a').html()
[14:01:30] <D4> I have a simular question actually, I have <li>text<form...><form...></li> and I need 'text' ;p
[14:01:51] <raj> omg, can someone please tell my why I'm getting "$("input:checkbox").each(checkValue).on is not a function" error in my console? http://71.232.89.204:8080/test
[14:02:29] <raj> why is it even stopping at .on
[14:02:36] <raj> why isn't it saying the whole line
[14:02:55] <ParadoxQuine> D4: i think you could use contents() and a filter to pull that out easily
[14:04:01] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: i havent used the scrollTo plugin, might want to just position your panes so that #2 is in the center of the page when it loads
[14:04:13] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: or there may be an option in scrollTo to choose the default
[14:04:21] <D4> ParadoxQuine » is it easier to make it <li><span>text</span>....</li> and use .find('span').html() ?
[14:04:33] <ParadoxQuine> D4: infinitely :)
[14:04:54] <D4> sounds like a plan :P
[14:04:56] <ParadoxQuine> D4: make sure to use children() or find("span").first() so you dont get too many descendants tho
[14:05:15] <ParadoxQuine> *children("span")
[14:05:46] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: or worst case you could scrollTo the second page in document.ready with an animation time of 0 :P but that's hacky
[14:06:04] <b-lew> yea, i'll see what i can do
[14:06:34] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: as for going from 2->1, i would just give an id to a link on 2 and override its click event to scrollTo #1 instead of the next one
[14:06:57] <b-lew> tried that already.
[14:07:09] <b-lew> going to have to see if you can set the default in the scrollto plugin
[14:07:19] <ParadoxQuine> mk
[14:09:00] <ParadoxQuine> can anyone suggest a way for me to make click() events register faster on touch devices? I have a site that is made for desktop but it looks pretty good on iphone/ipad already so a quick hack to make the touch events register faster would help me a lot while i develop the mobile frontend
[14:10:42] <b-lew> i don't think there is a way to set it
[14:10:43] <b-lew> lame
[14:11:08] <ParadoxQuine> b-lew: solution: roll your own :P itll be a good experience in the end
[14:12:47] <zduffy> How do you copy drop down boxes with jquery into another forms drop downs?
[14:13:36] <zduffy> I know with textboxs you use $("input#divid").val($("input#divid").val());
[14:13:39] <ParadoxQuine> zduffy: hey so what were you trying to do what wasnt working again?
[14:13:46] <ParadoxQuine> *that wasn't working
[14:13:50] <zduffy> ParadoxQuine: I figured it out ;)
[14:13:55] <ParadoxQuine> ok
[14:14:07] <zduffy> I had this.selected.value in when there wasn't a selected value
[14:14:26] <zduffy> I looked on the array list and put 239 instead of this.selected.value and it worked :)
[14:15:04] <zduffy> Now, I need to copy those drop downs to another forms drop downs.. How can I accomplish that?
[14:15:51] <b-lew> something like this?$("a.panel").load("#item2");
[14:16:49] <zduffy> so in my case $("#country").load("#country2");

[14:26:01] <nFFF> multiHYP
[14:26:06] <nFFF> Whats show?
[14:26:10] <nFFF> and whats $(this).?
[14:26:14] <NoiseEee> multiHYP:  $(document).on("click", "input.fetchData", function() { alert($(this).attr('value')) });
[14:26:20] <multiHYP> just a function that uses the value field
[14:26:33] <multiHYP> $(this) supposed to be the input button

[14:31:21] <multiHYP> but that is an anonymous function
[14:31:27] <NoiseEee> so?
[14:31:27] <multiHYP> its not exactly my example
[14:31:37] <NoiseEee> then investigate .bind()
[14:31:51] <NoiseEee> your function is... superfluous at best
[14:31:58] <multiHYP> i want to call show function in that hierarchy and pass $(this).attr('value') to it

[14:32:06] <DerekPioneer> ok this is really cool: http://raphaeljs.com/icons/#phone
[14:32:14] <NoiseEee> then investigate $.bind multiHYP
[14:32:15] <multiHYP> i use that function from other places too
[14:34:03] <ParadoxQuine> DerekPioneer: thats awesome
[14:34:04] <multiHYP> i don't know why javascript has to have so much anonymous functions, i added NoiseEee suggestion and it works, but why that extra anonymous function i don't understand.

[14:36:09] <multiHYP> what would the "this" then refer to ?
[14:37:03] <ParadoxQuine> whatever this refers to in the scope it is executed in
[14:37:09] <multiHYP> i guess this would be the $(document)?
[14:37:16] <ParadoxQuine> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scoping_and_dynamic_scoping
[14:37:24] <ParadoxQuine> javascript is dynamically scoped for the keyword this
[14:37:29] <multiHYP> i know what scope is :)
[14:37:39] <ParadoxQuine> you know what dynamic scope is then?
[14:38:08] <multiHYP> the problem is i cannot figure a getClass() or similar function that returns a better result than [object Object] for this.
[14:38:38] <ParadoxQuine> huh?
[14:38:41] <multiHYP> if i could get more info on that object, or its blueprint Object it would be great
[14:38:51] <ParadoxQuine> console.log(object)
[14:39:03] <ParadoxQuine> in inspector or firebug, prints out a nice view of the object that you can navigate
[14:39:05] <multiHYP> oh wait
[14:39:17] <multiHYP> let me try something
[14:39:50] <nFFF> Your jsfiddle works fine...
[14:39:52] <nFFF> Whats the issue
[14:40:29] <multiHYP> no thats not working, see http://jsfiddle.net/LrmF3/3/
[14:40:40] <multiHYP> what is $(this) in that scope?
[14:40:57] <multiHYP> .object was suggested by ParadoxQuine, but its not helping...
[14:41:24] <ParadoxQuine> .object? no i said console.log
[14:41:29] <multiHYP> and $(this) along gives [object Object]. I need more info about $(this) or that object. its type, class or something...
[14:42:01] <multiHYP> same thing ParadoxQuine, both give a string representation of undefined.
[14:42:24] <b-lew> got it
[14:42:26] <b-lew> sweet
[14:42:30] <ajpiano> multiHYP: use your debugger
[14:42:33] <multiHYP> did you mean this: http://jsfiddle.net/LrmF3/4/
[14:42:51] <multiHYP> yes it works now, i guess "this" was the entire document as suspected.
[14:43:00] <ajpiano> multiHYP: you are executing a function instead of referencing one
[14:43:03] <multiHYP> hence the extra anonymous function was required
[14:43:23] <Miadon> can anyone help with me, with my nooby problem?
[14:43:27] <ParadoxQuine> multiHYP: yea...your fiddle worked fine for me. this was bound to the document
[14:43:39] <ParadoxQuine> Miadon: probably yes, ask :)
[14:43:49] <ajpiano> it's not an "extra" anonymous function.
[14:43:59] <multiHYP> so i still don't get the behind the scene workings, but thanks guys, glad my code works now.
[14:44:02] <multiHYP> :)
[14:44:04] <ParadoxQuine> multiHYP: as i said, *this* is dynamically scoped so it was scoped to the document
[14:44:09] <nFFF> multiHYP your on some crazy ting
[14:44:15] <ajpiano> ParadoxQuine: it's not that it's "Dynamically Scoped" per se
[14:44:50] <ajpiano> the point is that when he does $("#foo").on("click", someFunc(this) ); it executes someFunc, passing the current 'this' of when that function was called
[14:44:52] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/LrmF3/5/
[14:44:57] <multiHYP> so by writing that anonym function i create a new object that rescopes "this"?
[14:45:06] <nFFF> you need to put your alert within a callback
[14:45:12] <Miadon> ParadoxQuine, I am trying to resize the height of a iframe (for youtube)  based on the width of the iframe..... http://pastebin.com/Q72DgRxq    so when the window is resized or however big the window is  it will always be the same proportion
[14:45:16] <ajpiano> and the return value of someFunc is what is passed to 'on' for later use as the event handler
[14:45:54] <Emn1ty> If anyone has the time I'd like some feedback on this and any possible improvements that can be made: http://jsfiddle.net/Td4Jc/3/
[14:45:56] <ParadoxQuine> ajpiano: what's the difference between passing the current value of this on execution and dynamically scoped this?
[14:45:58] <multiHYP> yes i think i get the function deal in javascript sort of
[14:46:26] <ajpiano> ParadoxQuine: jQuery runs all the event handler callbacks using .call, so that when the handler is actually executed
[14:46:36] <ajpiano> it's executed with the event.target as 'this'
[14:47:14] <nFFF> Emn1ty, the first suggestion is hit the 'tidy up' button at the top of jsfiddle :D
[14:47:24] <Emn1ty> alrighty
[14:47:33] <ParadoxQuine> ajpiano: ahhh ok. so if that was a normal callback and not jquery, it would be dynamic scoping breaking it right? (well, making it work not the desired way)
[14:47:53] <ajpiano> no, it's still what you pass
[14:47:59] <ajpiano> ParadoxQuine: do you understand this example
[14:48:04] <nFFF> And you seriously think anyone is going to crawl through several hundred lines of code to give you suggestions to improve? :>>>
[14:48:39] <ParadoxQuine> Miadon: what about that isnt working?
[14:48:53] <ajpiano> ParadoxQuine: more accurately, do you understand the difference between these two: function foo() { alert("hi"); };  document.addEventListener("click", foo ); document.addEventListener("click', foo() );
[14:48:58] <Miadon> it's not resizing the height at all
[14:49:02] <Emn1ty> nFFF: i was just asking, not necessarily a requirement
[14:49:20] <ParadoxQuine> ajpiano: yup
[14:50:07] <ajpiano> ok
[14:51:05] <ajpiano> ParadoxQuine: then you realise that the second one would break, because foo() doesnt' return a function so there is actually no handler properly bound to the click, yes?
[14:51:14] <ParadoxQuine> yup
[14:51:30] <ajpiano> so that's the entire issue :)
[14:51:33] <nFFF> what does foo() return?
[14:51:41] <ParadoxQuine> nothing
[14:51:42] <ajpiano> nFFF: undefined
[14:51:44] <ParadoxQuine> or undefined
[14:51:51] <Miadon> foobar
[14:51:54] <nFFF> why?
[14:52:10] <ajpiano> nFFF: because it doesn't return anything
[14:52:11] <ajpiano> look at the function.
[14:52:15] <Miadon> always been something to return nothing
[14:52:27] <ajpiano> a function that doesn't have an explicit return value returns undefined
[14:52:36] <nFFF> ajpiano shiat
[14:52:39] <nFFF> didnt see
[14:52:55] <smplstk> ?eval 2+2
[14:52:59] <bot-t> smplstk: 4
[14:53:13] <Miadon> ParadoxQuine, the height doesn't change at all, so I must be missing something or doing something wrong
[14:53:30] <ParadoxQuine> ajpiano: oh, i was totally overthinking/misreading it. i thought he was doing myobj.somefunc instead of wrapping that in a function
[14:53:44] <ParadoxQuine> ajpiano: i totally missed the fact that he didnt even provide a callback of any sort
[14:53:52] <ParadoxQuine> my bad :P
[14:53:56] <ajpiano> heh :)
[14:54:05] <ParadoxQuine> Miadon: ok lets see
[14:54:24] <ParadoxQuine> Miadon: is it definitely calling resize() when the window is resized?
[14:55:07] <Miadon> erm maybe that's what I'm missing.. how would I do that
[14:55:29] <ParadoxQuine> just put an alaert or a console.log inside the callback for resize
[14:56:13] <Miadon> sorry I'm a complete noob for jquerey what do I have to do.. to do that
[14:57:01] <ParadoxQuine> http://jsfiddle.net/Bv8LD/
[14:57:22] <ParadoxQuine> so when i run that i see it complains that window has no method resize
[14:57:47] <ParadoxQuine> which is...a problem lol
[14:58:04] <ParadoxQuine> a jsfiddle problem actually
[14:58:25] <Miadon> ok let me try that
[15:00:01] <ParadoxQuine> definitely triggering
[15:00:33] <Miadon> nope..
[15:00:35] <Miadon> :s
[15:01:43] <ParadoxQuine> its not triggering for you?
[15:01:51] <ParadoxQuine> also i once again overlooked the obvious
[15:01:59] <ParadoxQuine> .width() gets the width of the element
[15:02:03] <ParadoxQuine> which isn't changing
[15:02:08] <Miadon> oh.
[15:02:12] <ParadoxQuine> so thus the height isnt changing
[15:02:26] <nFFF> Should JS be able to work out the sum of all fib numbers without exceeding the stack?
[15:02:36] <nFFF> upto 4mill
[15:02:47] <Miadon> is it possible to work out the current with in pxs if it is 100%
[15:02:52] <ParadoxQuine> nFFF: depends on the approach i would think
[15:03:02] <ParadoxQuine> Miadon: yea
[15:03:05] <ajpiano> Miadon: i have a feeling it has more to do with the fact that you're trying to access the height of a cross domain iframe
[15:03:07] <ajpiano> http://css-tricks.com/cross-domain-iframe-resizing/
[15:03:20] <nFFF> recursive is slower than iterative, right?
[15:03:24] <D4> How do I target a parent 3 levels up?
[15:03:46] <ParadoxQuine> Miadon: http://jsfiddle.net/Bv8LD/3/
[15:03:49] <ParadoxQuine> simple example
[15:03:51] <D4> <this span><div><form><input from here> ?
[15:04:07] <ParadoxQuine> Miadon:  as ajpiano mentioned there might be other snags because you are using a cross domain iframe tho
[15:04:24] <ajpiano> D4: $(this).closest("span") is the thing you *should* do
[15:04:25] <ParadoxQuine> D4: .parent().parent().parent()? :P
[15:04:30] <nFFF> d4 ?closest
[15:04:36] <Miadon> hmmm
[15:04:38] <D4> oh
[15:04:39] <ParadoxQuine> but yes closest is correct
[15:04:40] <ajpiano> .parent().parent().parent() or .parents().eq(2) are both considerably worse
[15:04:49] <nFFF> lol
[15:04:52] <ParadoxQuine> yup
[15:04:53] <nFFF> for more than one reason
[15:05:27] <nFFF> Im bored out of my brain
[15:05:37] <nFFF> ajpiano got any good reading suggestions
[15:05:40] <nFFF> of anything s related
[15:05:43] <nFFF> js*
[15:05:53] <ParadoxQuine> nFFF: everything on crockford's site
[15:06:00] <zduffy> If I try and use $('#two').append($('#one').html());â€‹ it will not copy drop down id two to drop down id one. Why?
[15:06:17] <ajpiano> zduffy: don't copy using strings, copy using elements
[15:06:33] <zduffy> can you give me an example?
[15:06:42] <nFFF> Yea read mos of crockfords articles
[15:06:47] <ajpiano> zduffy: $("#two").append( $("#one").clone().attr("id", "three") );
[15:06:57] <zduffy> thank you
[15:07:10] <DerekPioneer> using $('.s7url').load().attr('src,'sdfasdf') to load images, if there's an image loading failure the url of the image i am loading returns text, how do i tell if the image that is returned is text or an image?
[15:07:17] <ajpiano> zduffy: the .html() of a select is all the optons inside of it, not the <select> itself
[15:07:31] <zduffy> so do I need to change id or three?
[15:07:39] <D4> So if I'd like to write out something inside this span, appending to it, I just do $(this).closest('span').append('something'); ?
[15:07:43] <zduffy> sorry I am confused
[15:08:02] <ajpiano> zduffy: you need to change the ID because you don't want to have more than one element with the same ID in your dom at a time
[15:08:16] <ajpiano> so that was just an example to illustrate that point
[15:08:21] <zduffy> I understand that. I have two different ids
[15:08:48] <ajpiano> nFFF: http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html
[15:08:51] <nFFF> DerekPioneer, why not just use native JS to load your images?
[15:08:53] <zduffy> What I have is a checkbox to copy shipping information to payment information
[15:09:08] <DerekPioneer> nFFF: idk, what does that mean?
[15:10:55] <nFFF> DerekPioneer, var i = new Image(); i.src = "www.foo.com";
[15:11:26] <crutex> Ìû
[15:11:33] <nFFF> that will load the image into your cache
[15:12:07] <nFFF> I don't understand how your image can return txt if it fails?
[15:14:10] <nFFF> ajpiano lol thanks
[15:14:13] <nFFF> ill read into these
[15:14:25] <nFFF> a lot of people either hate zedshaw
[15:14:27] <nFFF> or love him
[15:14:33] <nFFF> havent read any of his things yet though
[15:14:36] <nFFF> will make a point of it
[15:25:12] <pascal> irc client acts up
[15:26:37] <jarr0dsz> good evening everyone
[15:27:54] <initself> is the right syntax? $("a.confirm").confirm({
[15:28:11] <initself> <a class="confirm" href="edit/?id=[% l.id %]&delete=1">Delete</a>
[15:28:14] <initself> for that?
[15:28:25] <initself> how do i test that it is executing?
[15:34:09] <imsky> moooonday night
[15:54:32] <cliffordmeece> seeing a weird (i think) behavior of draggable and sortable.  I created a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/meecect/mASMu/
[15:55:06] <cliffordmeece> i can use draggable to a sortable (via connectToSortable) only if the draggable has helper set to 'clone'
[15:55:14] <cliffordmeece> is that the expected behavior?
[15:55:45] <cliffordmeece> oh crap
[15:55:50] <cliffordmeece> i guess it is expected
[15:56:13] <cliffordmeece> shoot
[15:56:26] <cliffordmeece> i swear i looked at the doco
[15:56:49] <cliffordmeece> now the docs say: (helper must be set to 'clone' in order to work flawlessly
[15:57:22] <cliffordmeece> well crap.  I need to mimic the behavior though.  any suggestions?  I need to connect a draggable to a sortable, but I cannot use clone.
[15:57:37] <cliffordmeece> or i can if there is some way to 'fake' it.
[15:58:11] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/z52Vv/
[15:58:37] <initself> i need .confirm to work for all of the <a class="confirm"> rows I'm attaching via JSON.
[15:58:54] <initself> can anyone help me add .confirm in the right spot?
[15:59:58] <ajpiano> cliffordmeece: just init sortable before you init draggable
[16:00:07] <ajpiano> you can't connectToSortable that hasn't been initailised yet :)
[16:00:36] <Emn1ty> anyone know how to apply patches like this: http://code.google.com/p/flot/issues/attachmentText?id=282&aid=5754939623986415417&name=flot.draggable.r229.patch&token=735f2af75a89ebf5291c9eb25ce55eb3 ?
[16:01:05] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: *nix?
[16:01:33] <eddiemonge> ?confirm
[16:01:39] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Fast Confirm - Plugins - jQuery - We've been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free experience at the plugins site for some time, and a major error on our part forced us to shut down the current site before we could put the... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fastconfirm
[16:01:41] <cliffordmeece> ajpiano, thanks, but that does not solve the problem.  actually, my example works the same in both cases, wether sortable is called first or wether draggable is called first
[16:02:00] <cliffordmeece> i just tried reversing it and get the same thing
[16:02:11] <eddiemonge> initself: confirm() ? the standard JS confirm?
[16:02:28] <cliffordmeece> if helps: clone, then it works.  if helper is default, then it throws an error
[16:02:42] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: what does that mean?
[16:02:45] <ajpiano> why can't you use helper: clone
[16:03:41] <cliffordmeece> because i am dragging elements around the page and they can be dropped anywhere (i.e., the user is moving them), but they can also be put 'on the shelf' which is a sortable
[16:03:58] <cliffordmeece> i dunno, maybe i can hide the originals
[16:04:12] <initself> eddiemonge: no, it's some plugin
[16:04:23] <initself> http://nadiana.com/jquery-confirm-plugin
[16:04:24] <ajpiano> cliffordmeece: you can probably do whatever you want with a helper: function
[16:05:38] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: what OS do you have?
[16:05:44] <ajpiano> just return a DOM element
[16:05:44] <Emn1ty> windows 7
[16:06:06] <eddiemonge> initself: it would be better to delegate the event handler but not sure if you can with that plugin
[16:08:14] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: you can either manually change the files or find some patch program that works on windows. if you were on a *nix based machine all you would have to do is patch < difffile
[16:09:10] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: how do I manually change the file? And does anyone know good software for it?
[16:09:42] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: seriously? you are asking how to manually edit a text file?
[16:10:05] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: more how do I interpret where the stuff goes
[16:10:14] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: it says in the file
[16:10:22] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy patch @ Emn1ty
[16:10:22] <bot-t> Emn1ty, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=patch
[16:10:27] <eddiemonge> top three results

[16:11:09] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: google search results are relative to the one using it
[16:12:21] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: did you try opening the file in windows?
[16:12:35] <Emn1ty> there is no file since there is no download
[16:12:48] <Emn1ty> its just that text document
[16:12:58] <Emn1ty> not sure if I should save it as a js or a patch file
[16:13:03] <eddiemonge> omg
[16:13:04] <eddiemonge> http://code.google.com/p/flot/issues/detail?id=282
[16:13:25] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: if you dont know what that file, why are you trying to use it?
[16:14:00] <Emn1ty> cause I need to make my chart draggable, and this is the only thing that does it. But there aren't any intructions for how to use it.
[16:14:11] <eddiemonge> how did you find it?
[16:14:14] <Emn1ty> ps: Windows can't open this file
[16:14:16] <Emn1ty> google
[16:14:19] <eddiemonge> what do you think it is?
[16:14:22] <Emn1ty> flot draggable
[16:14:58] <Emn1ty> Its a plugin that allows for you to drag the points plotted on the graph either on both axis or seperate axis. It says it in the file.
[16:15:00] <initself> eddiemonge: my issue is that I can't seem to assign .confirm until the JSON returns, but when I put it after append, the behavior of .confirm is weird on multiple rows: lots of dialog boxes popup
[16:15:35] <eddiemonge> initself: thats because .confirm() seems to call them
[16:15:37] <initself> is there an easy way to add .confirm to each class where it waits until the data has returned from JSON?
[16:16:16] <initself> .confirm() should only call one for each row
[16:16:38] <eddiemonge> initself: default JS style dialog boxes
[16:16:39] <eddiemonge> ?
[16:16:41] <initself> if I hit "Yes" to Are you sure?, it'll pop up another Are you sure? box, but not if I clicking the last row.
[16:16:47] <jaequery> whats the difference between input[name=bla] and input[@name=bla]
[16:16:51] <initself> eddiemonge: I don't mind that at all!
[16:17:05] <initself> How would I append those, given the JSON situation I'm in?
[16:17:40] <eddiemonge> initself: no, that was a question. what type of dialog boxes popup?
[16:17:59] <initself> Oh, the custom .confirm() boxes, inline in my code.
[16:18:15] <initself> Basically, the clickable url gets replaced with Are You Sure? [Yes] [No]
[16:18:19] <initself> it's pretty cool
[16:18:39] <initself> there's a demo here: http://nadiana.com/jquery-confirm-plugin
[16:18:44] <initself> Fourth Example
[16:18:57] <eddiemonge> initself: saw that. im trying to help troubleshoot your code
[16:21:33] <initself> seems really straightforward to me.  maybe the issue is in the plugin.
[16:21:38] <initself> i'm not attached to the plugin.
[16:24:56] <eddiemonge> initself: try this http://jsfiddle.net/z52Vv/1/

[16:28:54] <initself> eddiemonge: for ( ;i<len; i++ ) {
[16:28:56] <initself> is that busted?

[16:38:45] <initself> right after you define it
[16:39:04] <eddiemonge> right before the for?
[16:39:07] <initself> yes
[16:39:14] <initself> i dont think you can do json.contact_notes
[16:39:17] <initself> no, you can
[16:39:26] <initself> but whatever notes is doesn't have a lenm?
[16:39:26] <eddiemonge> it was from your code
[16:39:32] <initself> ya, that has stuff in it
[16:39:35] <eddiemonge> json.contact_notes
[16:39:36] <initself> notes is legit
[16:39:40] <eddiemonge> figured it was an array
[16:39:47] <eddiemonge> oops typo
[16:39:48] <eddiemonge> sorry
[16:39:48] <initself> notes = json.contact_notes # json array
[16:39:50] <eddiemonge> notes.length
[16:40:14] <initself> there we go
[16:40:17] <initself> there's me some notes
[16:40:20] * initself tries to delete.
[16:40:32] <initself> Beautiful!
[16:40:40] <initself> eddiemonge++ # thanks for taking the time!
[16:40:47] <eddiemonge> do you understand what i did?
[16:40:53] <initself> Now I'll try to understand.
[16:40:58] <eddiemonge> theres a lot of performace best practices in there
[16:41:05] <eddiemonge> well really 3
[16:41:16] <eddiemonge> for > $.each
[16:41:41] <eddiemonge> str concat (or join if you are ajpiano) + one append > appending in a loop
[16:41:50] <initself> stg.find confuses me
[16:41:52] <initself> str.find
[16:42:09] <eddiemonge> only search the new items and call the plugin on those instead of on all in the page again
[16:42:23] <eddiemonge> calling it on all the elements calls the plugin multiple times on some elements
[16:42:31] <initself> seems like the latter more than anything caused my "bug"?
[16:42:36] <eddiemonge> yeah
[16:42:47] <initself> right, you simply can't call it on all the elements.
[16:42:55] <eddiemonge> you were searching the whole dom and calling the plugin, regardless if they were already in it or not
[16:42:58] <initself> but what does str.find() do?
[16:43:03] <eddiemonge> ?find @ initself
[16:43:03] <bot-t> initself, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[16:43:15] <initself> so that gets you one at a time?
[16:43:29] <initself> oh, with str, you only have one.
[16:43:34] <initself> i gotcha.
[16:43:39] <eddiemonge> construct a string of html elements in the for loop. turn it into a jQobject that can do stuff $(str)
[16:43:44] <eddiemonge> then just use normal jQuery on it
[16:44:01] <initself> so this str = $(str) makes str an object.
[16:44:09] <initself> you turned a string into an object, correct?
[16:44:15] <eddiemonge> turns the plain string in a jQuery wrapped DOM representation
[16:44:19] <initself> that's badass.
[16:44:22] <initself> it's so simple!
[16:44:22] <eddiemonge> ?$()
[16:44:24] <bot-t> eddiemonge, ThickBox 3.1 - http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
[16:44:29] <eddiemonge> ? $
[16:44:29] <bot-t> bling
[16:44:32] <initself> heheh
[16:44:35] <initself> it is pretty bling
[16:44:35] <eddiemonge> ? jQuery
[16:44:36] <bot-t> jquery: A string containing the jQuery version number. http://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[16:44:38] <coldhead> lol thickbox
[16:44:53] <eddiemonge> initself: http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery2
[16:45:14] <initself> i thI thought at first your code was ugly, but now I think it's gorgeous
[16:45:24] <initself> especially when you take into account each() being slow
[16:45:37] <initself> wow, that's awesome, man
[16:45:47] <eddiemonge> all my code is beautiful, right coldhead
[16:46:08] <eddiemonge> except when its not because someone is annoying the eff out of me and i just want to get rid of them
[16:46:20] <initself> is for ( ;i<len; i++ ) { shorthand?
[16:46:47] <eddiemonge> you could put for ( var i=0;len=notes.length;i<len;i++)
[16:47:03] <eddiemonge> but since i was defining the variables right above it, i moved them into there
[16:47:11] <initself> oh, wow, i get it.
[16:47:22] <initself> that's a good lesson right there
[16:47:24] <initself> eddiemonge++
[16:47:39] <initself> wow, i have an exceptionally good feeling!
[16:47:41] <initself> thanks man!
[16:48:31] <eddiemonge> i accept donations towards burritos ;)
[16:49:26] <initself> gladly!
[16:49:28] <initself> pm me!
[16:49:48] <tetradon> I'm getting a "Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html warning message"
[16:49:58] <initself> is it trivial to now extrapolate from the href and create a JSON query?
[16:50:03] <rocktop> why this is not working in IE http://jsfiddle.net/3NtPD/ ?
[16:50:22] <tetradon> I'm using jquery to change the style for a div by changing the background image
[16:52:29] <tetradon> Is there a way in jquery to pass a content type header?
[16:54:54] <eddiemonge> initself attr("href")
[16:55:17] <eddiemonge> tetradon: because your web server is sending web images as text/html instead of the correct mime type
[16:55:37] <eddiemonge> but its a warning that can be ignored if you dont want to fix it
[16:55:51] <tetradon> well sometimes the image isn't displayed
[16:56:01] <eddiemonge> tetradon: are you doing it correctly?
[16:56:33] <tetradon> what's the correct way?
[16:57:56] <eddiemonge> initself: http://jsfiddle.net/z52Vv/3/
[16:58:04] <eddiemonge> tetradon: the way that is correct
[16:58:18] <eddiemonge> how are you doing it?
[16:58:21] <initself> eddiemonge: dude, you are off the chain
[16:59:28] <raj> eddiemonge, I have http://paste.ofcode.org/ynQkEHAsnidxk2sFVZEyLv . But when I refresh a page, sometimes checkboxes are already checked from before (browser feature), yet those don't seem to get POSTed (or show up in console.log within checked_items
[16:59:32] <raj> )
[17:00:19] <tetradon> eddiemonge: I use .css to change the background image
[17:00:26] <eddiemonge> its like most of you find new paste sites just to annoy me
[17:00:40] <raj> what's wrong with paste.ofcode?
[17:00:42] <eddiemonge> and they keep getting worse
[17:00:43] <raj> it's so clean
[17:00:48] <eddiemonge> how the hell do i edit it?
[17:00:59] <raj> oh =T
[17:01:01] <raj> fair enough
[17:01:07] <eddiemonge> thats why i have see ? pe
[17:01:08] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. Pastebin.com sucks
[17:02:03] <rocktop> anyidea please ?
[17:02:49] <initself> eddiemonge: i'm trying!  getting some kind of syntax error, trying to figure it out
[17:03:08] <eddiemonge> rocktop: gots to be a bit more descriptive
[17:03:19] <raj> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/jF6VY/
[17:03:21] <eddiemonge> not working is pretty vague
[17:04:14] <initself> object doesn't support this property or method
[17:04:18] <initself> that's from IE
[17:04:30] <initself> maybe .end() any good with .confirm()?
[17:04:37] <rocktop> eddiemonge: I have this  http://jsfiddle.net/3NtPD/ work in all browser but IE how can I get it work in IE ?
[17:04:38] <initself> not sure about the chain
[17:05:00] <eddiemonge> rocktop: this is better http://jsfiddle.net/3NtPD/1/
[17:05:18] <eddiemonge> rocktop: but again, not working is kind of meaningless. what is not working?
[17:05:43] <eddiemonge> initself: i didnt test it. might be typo or something
[17:05:55] <eddiemonge> tetradon: ok so whats not working?
[17:06:00] <raj> eddiemonge, checkValue is being run for each, so how is it not detecting that the box is checked?
[17:06:04] <initself> ? end
[17:06:04] <bot-t> .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[17:06:55] <tetradon> eddiemonge: I get a warning for the resource being sent as type/html. I don't know what.
[17:07:00] <rocktop> eddiemonge: I would like to hide the <div contain home page
[17:07:02] <tetradon> why*
[17:07:40] <initself> eddiemonge: str.find( [Break On This Error] }).end().find("a.delete").on("click", function(e){
[17:07:51] <tetradon> rocktop: .hide or .css("display" : "none");
[17:10:07] <eddiemonge> raj: i dont think i did anything but try http://jsfiddle.net/jF6VY/1/
[17:10:24] <eddiemonge> initself: the end is for the find
[17:10:37] <eddiemonge> initself: what version of jQuery do you have?
[17:10:40] <initself> 1.4
[17:10:51] <raj> eddiemonge, well, that's definitely cleaner than what I had :)
[17:10:57] <rocktop> tetradon: dosn't work
[17:11:10] <initself> end is in 1.0!
[17:11:12] <eddiemonge> tetradon: i told you why that is
[17:11:15] <eddiemonge> its your server
[17:12:13] <tetradon> rocktop: $(this).hide();
[17:12:56] <tetradon> or $('.homepage').hide(); whatever the name of your class or id
[17:13:03] <eddiemonge> rocktop: http://jsfiddle.net/3NtPD/4/
[17:13:08] <raj> eddiemonge, what's the 'e' argument for?
[17:13:12] <raj> to checkValue(e)?
[17:13:14] <eddiemonge> initself: thats why. on() is 1.7+
[17:13:19] <initself> dammit
[17:13:23] * initself upgrades.
[17:13:40] <tetradon> yeah what eddiemonge said because he followed your question better
[17:13:45] <eddiemonge> raj: i was going to do e.preventDefault() but wasnt sure if you still needed it.
[17:13:50] <raj> oh
[17:13:53] <rocktop> eddiemonge:Thank you very much
[17:14:07] <raj> you also change daround value=current.val() to value=this.value
[17:14:09] <eddiemonge> raj: it can be ignored or left off
[17:14:24] <raj> why's that?
[17:14:24] <eddiemonge> raj: yeah, no need for jQuery when jQuery is no needed
[17:14:31] <raj> oh ok
[17:14:36] <initself> Syntax error, unrecognized expression: td:nth-child
[17:14:36] <initself> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js
[17:14:51] <initself> did that get deprecated?
[17:15:01] * initself might be about to experience a can of whoopass.
[17:15:01] <eddiemonge> raj: in fact, current isnt really needed either since $(this) is only called once
[17:15:32] <eddiemonge> initself: no
[17:16:26] <initself> .children("td:nth-child(" + columnIndex + ")")
[17:17:12] <eddiemonge> ?nth
[17:17:13] <bot-t> eddiemonge, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[17:17:37] <initself> am i abusing it?
[17:18:00] <raj> eddiemonge, so should current.next('a').html() be this.next... ?
[17:18:05] <raj> or must it be $(this)?
[17:18:14] <raj> oh, it has to be a jquery object
[17:18:15] <raj> hmm
[17:18:18] <eddiemonge> initself: what are you trying to grab with it? you might want see ? eq
[17:18:18] <bot-t> initself, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[17:18:32] <eddiemonge> raj: right
[17:18:57] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/PLsqS/
[17:19:11] <raj> eddiemonge, none of the return statements are needed either?
[17:20:36] <eddiemonge> initself: what is columnIndex?
[17:20:40] <eddiemonge> raj: nope
[17:20:54] <eddiemonge> raj: unless you want to prevent the box from being checked
[17:20:57] <initself> $("#cytd_order_net_ext_sums").html(sumOfColumns("tablesorter", product_cols_start + 0, true, "float"));
[17:20:58] <raj> i'm getting a syntax error with 'else {' btw
[17:21:21] <eddiemonge> initself: so then its just an integer index value?
[17:21:29] <initself> y
[17:21:53] <eddiemonge> raj: are you sure?
[17:21:58] <eddiemonge> on the else line?
[17:22:16] <raj> yeah
[17:22:35] <raj> not in your jsfiddle paste
[17:22:44] <raj> but on the page
[17:22:53] <eddiemonge> raj: lint your code
[17:23:09] <eddiemonge> initself: not sure, rarely, in fact never, use nth-child myself
[17:23:17] <eddiemonge> not as a JS selector anyway
[17:23:18] <initself> nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
[17:23:27] <initself> i'm dead w/out you on 1.7!
[17:23:27] <raj> eddiemonge, oh, it's cuz i put a ; after the if statement
[17:23:32] * initself pines for the day of 1.4!
[17:23:36] <initself> s/day/days/
[17:24:02] <eddiemonge> initself: i would say just make sure columnIndex is a number
[17:24:23] <eddiemonge> but 1.7 is so much better/cleaner/faster
[17:25:34] <raj> eddiemonge, I only wanna post when .each is done though, right?
[17:25:57] <eddiemonge> raj: ideally yes
[17:26:12] <eddiemonge> you should try and limit the number of ajax requests
[17:26:49] <raj> eddiemonge, so is there some .each done callback?
[17:29:30] <eddiemonge> raj: you want it to fire on page load right? even though it shouldnt need to since its coming from the server already?
[17:29:57] <raj> yeah
[17:30:16] <eddiemonge> you read that second question right?
[17:30:17] <raj> yeah, but I can't send a filter from the server
[17:30:30] <eddiemonge> what do you mean?
[17:30:47] <raj> well, I'm gonna have a div that is gonna show options, depending on the colors that are selected
[17:30:51] <eddiemonge> the server should already know the boxes checked state if they are from the server
[17:31:00] <raj> a user might have some defaults set though for the checkboxes
[17:31:14] <eddiemonge> raj: which is still coming from the server right?
[17:31:16] <raj> yeah, but it will make my server-side code very ugly
[17:31:44] <raj> so I want it always to be requested
[17:32:07] <raj> since I'm using javascript to do the filtering
[17:32:23] <raj> at least, my current thinking is that's the best way to go about it
[17:33:56] <eddiemonge> ok then lets make the front end very ugly: http://jsfiddle.net/jF6VY/2/
[17:35:35] <initself> eddiemonge: columnIndex is NaN
[17:35:38] <initself> do i just go:
[17:35:51] <initself> return if columnIndex = NaN?
[17:35:53] <Faryshta> I have a problem which I can't solve with CSS. http://www.webdevout.net/test?01h How can I get the green div to cover till the end of the page?
[17:35:57] <eddiemonge> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/jF6VY/3/
[17:36:17] <eddiemonge> initself: sure. or you could fix columnIndex
[17:36:31] <raj> analyzing...
[17:37:42] <eddiemonge> Faryshta: whats wrong with http://www.webdevout.net/test?01j
[17:37:44] <paissad> hello guys, i start with jquery, .. if i use the $.parseXML() function in order to read this xml file http://pastebin.com/YUSX98Ae ... if i do a -> find('type') .. how can i iterate over all values of type tag ?
[17:37:48] <paissad> thanks in advance
[17:38:15] <eddiemonge> ?each @ paissad
[17:38:16] <bot-t> paissad, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[17:38:35] <paissad> eddiemonge, ok mate, thanks
[17:39:03] <eddiemonge> 9 out of 10 times $.parseXML() isnt needed though ...
[17:39:13] <eddiemonge> same with parseJSON()
[17:40:41] <Faryshta> eddiemonge, I need that the green div runs till the end of the page without breaking a new line.
[17:40:50] <raj> eddiemonge, i'm not familiar with e.type
[17:40:59] <paissad> eddiemonge, i have to parse the JSON or XML response from a request to one the Google APIs, .. would you like to tell me more if i could avoid the use of parseXML & if ever it would be a better idea :P
[17:41:52] <eddiemonge> Faryshta: and whats wrong with that css only example? its still a css issue
[17:41:57] <eddiemonge> raj: event.type
[17:42:18] <eddiemonge> paissad: how are you calling the ajax request?
[17:42:39] <Faryshta> Faryshta, The green div isn't big enough. I don't know how to make it reach till the end.
[17:43:27] <paissad> eddiemonge, http://pastebin.com/TWLyiZf8
[17:43:37] <eddiemonge> Faryshta: looked big enough in my example
[17:44:12] <eddiemonge> paissad: yup, like i said, no parseXML needed
[17:44:32] <eddiemonge> paissad: you should be caching $(this) though
[17:44:42] <paissad> eddiemonge, ok great ... thanks
[17:46:24] <BillCriswell> I'm having a weird issue with $.get, it's making the request but the callback isn't firing. Can anyone tell me what the issue is? Nothing is jumping out at me... http://prostores.intuitsolutions.net/2.html
[17:47:48] <tetradon> I'm using .delay(100).stop(true,true).slideDown('fast').show();
[17:48:02] <tetradon> to slideDown a div with an image
[17:48:31] <coldhead> BillCriswell: jsonlint.com says your json is not valid
[17:48:31] <tetradon> It seems to work fine for me but I had a user tell me the image never showed itself
[17:48:40] <coldhead> probably because of the comment at the start
[17:48:57] <coldhead> invalid json is not success according to jquery
[17:49:10] <coldhead> whence the lack of success handling in this instance
[17:49:17] <BillCriswell> coldhead: It's not expecting JSON though, right?
[17:49:30] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: parsererror
[17:49:36] <BillCriswell> Shouldn't it just be getting the result as a string?
[17:49:36] <tetradon> Is there anything wrong with my code? Like by using the delay it prevents the slidedown because it clear the queue too quickly?
[17:49:56] <coldhead> it will take a guess if you don't specify the dataType
[17:50:03] <coldhead> try specifying a dataType
[17:50:04] <BillCriswell> coldhead: Ahhh.
[17:50:04] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: add .error(function(a,b,c) { console.log(a,b,c) }) to the get call
[17:50:32] <raj> so eddiemonge how come .each isn't needed anymore?
[17:50:46] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: your response content-type is json so its trying to parse it as json
[17:51:31] <eddiemonge> raj: wasnt it still in there?
[17:51:41] <eddiemonge> tetradon: you have slidedown and show?
[17:51:46] <eddiemonge> those do the same things
[17:51:51] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Got it. Could I over ride that so jQuery things it's just like a string so I can remove that comment and use parseJSON on it?
[17:51:59] <tetradon> eddiemonge: oops lol
[17:52:06] <tetradon> eddiemonge: yeah they do
[17:52:07] <lenswipe> hey guys
[17:52:15] <lenswipe> anyone around for a quick Q&A session
[17:52:19] <initself> this isn't legit? if ($("#cytd_order_net_ext_sums").exists()) {
[17:52:24] <eddiemonge> raj: it is still needed. not sure why i deleted it
[17:52:30] <BillCriswell> Ah, I can just use 'html'. Thanks!
[17:52:33] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, can i ask you a quick question?
[17:52:36] <PrgmrBill> initself: use .length and it will
[17:52:44] <BillCriswell> Bill!
[17:52:48] <PrgmrBill> Bill!
[17:52:48] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: why not just remove the comment from the server so it is actually valid JSON?
[17:53:03] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: I have no control over that sadly.
[17:53:12] <BillCriswell> This whole API is screwy.
[17:53:29] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: thats a pretty shitty API returning invalid responses
[17:53:48] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: You're not kidding.
[17:53:50] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, you know on facebook you add multiple recipients to a message by typing their name and they appear in a little blue bubble and then {presumably} the message window posts that user's ID back to the controller
[17:53:57] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, how easy would that be to impliment?
[17:54:03] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: id boycott it or stab the developer in the eye and say you fix it
[17:54:07] <initself> no worky for me: if ($("#cytd_order_net_ext_sums").length()) {
[17:54:26] <PrgmrBill> initself: that means there are no elements matching that selector
[17:54:31] <BillCriswell> I believe it's eBay ( it's an ecommerce platform called "ProStores" ).
[17:54:33] <ColKurtz> I've always used qTip for my tool-tips, does anybody else have a plugin they like to use?
[17:54:35] <PrgmrBill> console.log($("#cytd_order_net_ext_sums"));
[17:54:39] <initself> right, i want to check if there are elements matching.
[17:54:44] <initself> because there are not!
[17:54:52] <BillCriswell> PrgmrBill == Bill B_____ ?
[17:54:57] <PrgmrBill> BillCriswell: yes duh
[17:55:02] <BillCriswell> Just making sure haha.
[17:55:07] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: search around for facebook autocomplete multiselect jquery
[17:55:22] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, thank you
[17:55:26] <eddiemonge> initself: .length no parens
[17:55:43] <eddiemonge> ColKurtz: jqui has a slick one in development
[17:55:55] <initself> eddiemonge++ # hooray for you!
[17:56:12] <eddiemonge> today was a good irc day
[17:56:19] <initself> hells ya, boooyeeee!

[17:57:15] <ColKurtz> I suppose I'll just go with qTip since I don't already use jqui
[18:01:54] <BillCriswell> You made money helping in IRC? Jealous of that.
[18:04:49] <zduffy> Can anyone tell me how to copy dropdown selections from one set of dropdowns to another?
[18:09:22] <BillCriswell> zduffy: You have to clone it then set the value of it manually.
[18:10:47] <zduffy> BillCriswell: the value is dynamic
[18:10:57] <zduffy> its pulled out of an array
[18:12:10] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/djwmF/1/ why is that showing immediately when i scroll instead of when the current size of the window is scrolled past?
[18:13:06] <BillCriswell> Have some example code?
[18:13:31] <BillCriswell> Are you copying using .clone() ?
[18:17:44] <zduffy> BillCriswell: one sec jsfiddle
[18:17:51] <paissad> guys, i know this is not #aptana, but i'm just trying :) .. actually, i only would like to have the autocompletion of JQuery functions, but i don't ... i tried to configure Aptana, but i see nowhere i could set up JQuery's stuff
[18:17:53] <paissad> http://minus.com/mBE5Nr3d#1f
[18:18:01] <paissad> Aptana 3 btw
[18:19:01] <paissad> i'm not productive if i switch too much between the JQuery site and my IDE, that does not help me focus correctly :/

[18:26:08] <chazu2> anybody know the trick to creating buttonset-styled radio button forms in rails with form helper methods?
[18:26:16] <chazu2> i can't seem to get it to work
[18:27:11] <BillCriswell> zduffy: What is your main goal here? Just to get the countries listed in the second one?
[18:27:33] <zduffy> BillCriswell: Exactly like this http://www.encaffeinated.com/sandbox/copy_fields/
[18:27:59] <zduffy> My text box fields copy easily. Its just the dynamic drop downs that are giving me a hard time
[18:28:32] <zduffy> If a user selects United States for country and New York for the state, I want them to be able to copy that into the billing dropdowns
[18:28:54] <BillCriswell> It should really just be $('#select2').val( $('#select1').val() );
[18:29:31] <BillCriswell> zduffy: Keep in mind the option will need to exist for val() to populate it properly.
[18:29:53] <zduffy> And it won't because the first select has an on change
[18:30:05] <bios> hey .. question.. if I want to select all elements (which happen to be text inputs) with class .textfield and then set the value of that input to "" .. how can I do that in one line..  .. I thought something like this: $(".textfield").click(function(){this.text("");});
[18:30:21] <bios> can someone point out what I'm doing wrong please ?
[18:30:22] <zduffy> Country populates state via onchange
[18:31:04] <bios> oh.. I mean clear them on click ..
[18:34:07] <BillCriswell> zduffy: You'll have to trigger change on the country select.
[18:34:39] <BillCriswell> $('#country2').val( $('#country1').val() ).trigger('change');
[18:35:03] <zduffy> and make change a variable with the on change command?
[18:36:14] <zduffy> BillCriswell: this is what makes the states pop from the select on change on country: print_state('State',this.selectedIndex);
[18:39:45] <LukeNukem> Hey
[18:39:54] <LukeNukem> is it possible to have if statement within .html("")
[18:39:56] <Majicpanda> how do i send a jquery ajax call and ensure the user cannot spam the button to send a bunch at once?
[18:40:09] <BillCriswell> LukeNukem: Yes.
[18:40:10] <Majicpanda> not sure what the best method would be.. immediate disable of button and on callback re-enable it?
[18:40:13] <LukeNukem> Majicpanda, remove the button on click
[18:40:20] <LukeNukem> BillCriswell, how can i? i tried googling but cant find the answer
[18:40:30] <coldhead> you probably want a template engine for that kind of complexity, LukeNukem
[18:40:30] <Majicpanda> no other way? run sync calls, etc?
[18:40:52] <Majicpanda> removing the button from my rpg type interface would be ugly
[18:40:54] <LukeNukem> coldhead, i dont want to use a template engine but please do tell me :>
[18:41:05] <LukeNukem> Majicpanda, render the button unclickable
[18:41:22] <Majicpanda> i could change the class and add it back eh?
[18:41:28] <Majicpanda> since its .class on click
[18:41:29] <BillCriswell> LukeNukem: http://api.jquery.com/html/ It's like the third yellow box from the bottom.
[18:41:38] <LukeNukem> put it inside a div, on click of the button do a (".div").html("button change code here, render it unclickable")
[18:41:40] <Majicpanda> ill give that kind of idea a shot
[18:42:47] <Majicpanda> onclick, remove class clickable, when ajax callback complete, add class clickable should work great eh?
[18:43:05] <LukeNukem> BillCriswell, wheer?
[18:43:14] <LukeNukem> Majicpanda, yes
[18:43:24] <LukeNukem> on the success callback, make it clickable
[18:43:42] <BillCriswell> LukeNukem: Do a command+f for "As of jQuery 1.4, the .html() method allows the HTML content to be set by passing in a function."
[18:44:07] <Majicpanda> ohhh this will work nice, skills have a cooldown so i can even wait 2 turns by using this method and passing back
[18:44:13] <Majicpanda> zing, thanks
[18:44:41] <LukeNukem> BillCriswell, i dont see the if statement in that o.o
[18:45:15] <Sedecrem> I have a ajax call that gets a xml object (mimie type defined as text/xml in the call). I now need to be able to get information from the schema. Are there inbuilt xml object handling methods in jquery or do I access the xml text string directly and work like that?
[18:47:20] <BillCriswell> LukeNukem: It would be like... $('.foo').html(function() { return 1 < 2 ? "Yup" : "Nope" });
[18:47:48] <LukeNukem> ok
[18:48:04] <BillCriswell> LukeNukem: You can do anything in that function, all the ifs you want.
[18:48:42] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').html(function(){ if( foo ) { return "Yes!" } else { return "Nope!" } });
[18:50:11] <zduffy> BillCriswell. I figured it out almost.. In my event that gets fired, it has this.selectedIndex, but that obviously does not work. How can i get the selected index of the previous state drop down?
[18:50:15] <BillCriswell> LukeNukem: You could even do like.. $('.foo').html( foo ? "Yup" : "Nope" );
[18:50:16] <bios> nm.. I figured it out.. :]
[18:52:33] <someprimetime> how can i select the hidden pseudo selector by using a cached variable? something like $foobar.hidden()
[18:53:23] <kaylee> if I have a bunch of draggables and a bunch of droppables... how do I associate one specific draggable to one specific droppable?
[19:17:07] <zduffy> .val() gives me the string in a drop down, how do I get the value?
[19:19:16] <raj> zduffy, what do you mean?
[19:19:47] <zduffy> If I alert($('#State').val()); it gives me the State, not the value..
[19:20:16] <zduffy> The states are saved in arrays..
[19:20:26] <zduffy> and I need the array number, not the State
[19:26:03] <joikus> guys without the alert, my rendering looks broken
[19:26:04] <joikus> http://pastebin.com/X0q8feqT
[19:26:20] <joikus> if i keep this alert, and click ok when it alerts, the screen renders properly
[19:26:29] <joikus> any ideas?
[20:25:00] <blindMoe_> can I not use $(document).addEventListener() in IE7?
[20:25:21] <blindMoe_> I am getting: SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'addEventListener'
[20:25:36] <blindMoe_> and all other jquery / javascript is working fine if I remove the offending line
[20:25:54] <ngharo> you're calling a native dom method on a jquery object
[20:26:11] <ngharo> if you want to bind an event with jquery use on(), see ?on
[20:26:12] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:26:20] <ngharo> else just call document.addEventListener()
[20:27:06] <blindMoe_> ngharo: I actually had document.addEventListener() first but switched it to try it out w/ jquery  :/
[20:32:01] <blindMoe_> hrmm get the same error in IE8 as well
[20:33:13] <ngharo> that's why you should use $(document).on( ... ) instead
[20:33:32] <ngharo> if you read the docs, addEventListener is only supported on IE9+
[20:33:50] <blindMoe_> yeah just realizing this
[20:33:53] <blindMoe_> thanks
[20:38:26] <lord_D> if i pass an array with 3 elements inside it to a switch as array.length , can i traverse the switch with 0 1 2?
[20:38:48] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure you can't, no
[20:39:35] <lord_D> https://gist.github.com/944111 then what happens on line 20?
[20:40:20] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, I missed the fact that you were operating on .length
[20:40:26] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by "traverse"?
[20:40:39] <lord_D> traverse or select an option in the switch
[20:41:30] <lord_D> this.options.args contains command line arguments
[20:41:37] <Eviltwin> What?
[20:41:46] <Eviltwin> Again, what do you mean by "traverse"?
[20:41:51] <Eviltwin> Try not using "traverse" in your defintion
[20:42:02] <coldhead> wise words
[20:42:30] <lord_D> can i select the options in the switch with array.length?
[20:42:39] <lord_D> given that the options are 0 1 2
[20:42:46] <Eviltwin> A switch is like a magical if statement
[20:43:05] <Eviltwin> The same way that you can access vars inside an if statement, you can access vars inside a switch
[20:43:52] <lord_D> what is the result of array.length? the index?
[20:44:04] <Eviltwin> ...
[20:44:10] <Eviltwin> It's the...length of the array
[20:45:43] <lord_D> i dont get how he selects the options
[20:46:00] <Eviltwin> I don't get how you don't get how he selects the options
[20:46:37] <lord_D> if the query was the word "profound" wouldnt that bring length to 8?
[20:47:05] <lord_D> hence he couldnt select case 1
[20:47:31] <Eviltwin> If this.options.args was "profound" then yes
[20:47:36] <Eviltwin> But this.options.args is an array presumably
[20:47:44] <lord_D> right
[20:48:26] <Eviltwin> Like ["profound"] or ["profound", "en-US"] or something like that
[20:48:31] <Eviltwin> What's the length of that first thing?
[20:49:26] <lord_D> oooh he passes three arguments
[20:49:50] <lord_D> and language is optional
[20:50:39] <lord_D> how sad. i was hoping it worked the way i thought it did :(
[20:50:56] <Eviltwin> I'm still not sure how you thought it did
[20:51:48] <lord_D> i thought array.length would return the index
[20:52:39] <Eviltwin> The index of...what?
[20:53:01] <lord_D> of the array
[20:53:08] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[20:53:10] <lord_D> array[index]
[20:53:10] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that?
[20:53:25] <Eviltwin> You know arrays can have more than one index, right?
[20:53:58] <lord_D> O.o you mean dimensions
[20:54:08] <Eviltwin> I mean array[0] array[1] array[2]
[20:54:13] <Eviltwin> Those are three different array incides
[20:54:17] <Eviltwin> indicies*
[20:54:48] <lord_D> yes and i wanted to loop through my array by index
[20:54:59] <Eviltwin> A switch isn't going to do that for you
[21:00:04] <lord_D> i know
[21:12:18] <aqeel> hi room
[21:14:46] <Aquilas> Hey guys quick questions: Can jQuery.get("php file url", "map of vars) return whatever was returned in the php file into a javascript var
[21:14:48] <Aquilas> for example
[21:15:14] <Aquilas> var test = jQuery.get("test.php", random map);
[21:18:56] <aro> can you set a max height on a jquery ui tab container?
[21:20:58] <ngharo> Aquilas: that's not how asynchronous programming work
[21:21:11] <ngharo> Aquilas: you have access to the returned data in the callback function
[21:21:25] <Aquilas> dang
[21:21:49] <ngharo> whatever it is you want to do with "test", you can do in the callback
[21:22:10] <Aquilas> I need to update a div that's already made, but I guess I can do it
[21:22:16] <Aquilas> In the callback
[21:22:20] <ngharo> yep
[21:22:23] <Aquilas> Thanks guys
[21:22:28] <Heshanh> hey guys, im not usre if this a jq or css, im trying to align divs so they sit right under each other withouth big gaps. http://i44.tinypic.com/2jano6r.jpg
[21:22:42] <Aquilas> css
[21:23:11] <Aquilas> But I think you can try clear: both; for all the divs
[21:23:23] <Heshanh> thanks :)
[21:23:24] <Aquilas> and create a padding
[21:24:05] <Heshanh> clearh both moves everything to the left
[21:24:54] <ngharo> there's a good plugin for this, but the name escapes me
[21:25:11] <Aquilas> clear: both; clears floating elements on both sides
[21:25:20] <Aquilas> I believe your others divs have to have  float attr as well
[21:25:40] <ngharo> Heshanh: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[21:25:55] <Heshanh> all the sub-menu divs are floated left
[21:26:08] <Heshanh> ah!
[21:26:11] <Heshanh> thanks
[21:26:48] <Aquilas> Well make sure every div has the clear:both attr but yea just use the plugin
[21:27:14] <Heshanh> i think plugin is the ay to go. thank u heaps guys
[21:27:51] <aqeel> not clear both but the side u want them to be
[21:28:08] <aqeel> float left,clearleft.....will align top bottom on left
[21:28:24] <aqeel> on all floated items
[21:29:09] <aqeel> clear both means u want total control on the element and break out of float
[21:30:03] <Heshanh> woah!
[21:30:06] <Heshanh> that is justa wesome
[21:30:09] <Heshanh> worked like a charm
[21:30:45] <Aquilas> If i wanted to update a div in the callback function, does the div have to be included in the map?
[21:31:04] <Eviltwin> That's a pretty vague question
[21:31:05] <Eviltwin> ?cik
[21:31:10] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[21:31:22] <Eviltwin> Please make a (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net

[21:51:17] <aqeel> 1024*768
[21:51:26] <aro> what is your job
[21:51:56] <aqeel> well import/export business.....but am working on my site though
[21:52:13] <aro> get a higher res ;)
[21:52:50] <monk13> hello all, i was looking at jquery BBQ for first time, on handling ajax back/next buttons in browser for ajax web app...
[21:53:16] <aqeel> but remeber not everyone can do that...though i will be changing.....but this is at least minimum for the timebeing worldwide
[21:53:28] <aqeel> 1024x768
[21:53:40] <monk13> I was curious, a url that has a hash tag by default shouldnt by default 're-GET' the page, correct?
[21:53:43] <aro> ya i know
[21:53:55] <monk13> i assume it stays on the page, and the page then goes to the #name.
[21:54:52] <monk13> Was curious why this jquery BBQ example then reloads: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-basic/#burger.html
[21:55:34] <monk13> the javascript triggers haschange event, but on page reload, which i thought the browser would stop from happening by default behavior
[21:56:02] <aqeel> aro your question...
[21:56:31] <aro> yeah
[21:57:40] <aqeel> so after clicking roles?
[21:57:56] <aro> see how its really long
[21:58:48] <aqeel> so u want to break this into sections of different pages
[21:59:18] <aro> no i just want a max height on the container
[21:59:21] <aro> i could paginate it
[21:59:23] <aro> but id rather not
[21:59:42] <aqeel> aro u are mistaking the tag....
[22:00:04] <aqeel> max height will not set the height u want any thing more than that will increase the height...
[22:00:36] <aro> i know
[22:00:47] <aqeel> max  height means if  browser window is resized.....the height of container will drop below max height
[22:01:12] <aqeel> then simply give some fixed height/
[22:01:21] <aro> to what
[22:01:40] <aqeel> say how many entries u want on one page
[22:03:12] <aqeel> max  height means if  browser window is resized.....the height of container will *not* drop below max height
[22:03:33] <aro> aqeel: can you do me a favor and refresh
[22:03:41] <aqeel> ok
[22:03:42] <aro> and tell me if it fixes the long scroll
[22:04:17] <aqeel> yup now seems fine
[22:04:21] <aro> awesome
[22:05:09] <aqeel> aro ....got to go.....work...thanks
[22:05:11] <aro> i just want a fixed height of like 500px on the tab box
[22:05:14] <aro> ok
[22:05:43] <aqeel> well count the entries say 15 or 20 and set height accordingly will please the reader too
[22:06:05] <aqeel> and have paged the entries...
[22:06:25] <aqeel> but then again what u prefer is best...
[22:06:33] <aqeel> bye room
[22:08:31] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/PqNU4/
[22:08:42] <initself> }).end().find("a.delete").on("click", function(e){ # is probably wrong
[22:08:56] <aro> whats that
[22:09:07] <initself> i'm trying to run the href only after .confirm "yes" has been clicked
[22:09:36] <initself> instead, it runs the href no matter what upon clicking it

[22:24:36] <tetradon> I have a post being submitted used .post asynchronously. After I submit, my .keypress on enter no longer works but it works before I submit
[22:28:15] <tetradon> should I be clearing something after the .post? Is that why on enter is not working?
[22:31:20] <Cork> tetradon: your replacing anything on page after the post?
[22:32:36] <tetradon> Cork: I'm appending a div
[22:32:54] <munderwo> Hi all. Im attempting to do a $.ajax() request from localhost/index.html to localhost:8080/sessions. I think I might have an issue with crossDomain stuff. But atm im getting back an object that has empty functions for all the methods..
[22:32:59] <Cork> tetradon: your not replacing the input fields?
[22:33:10] <tetradon> Cork: no
[22:33:22] <Cork> tetradon: then no keypress should keep working
[22:34:14] <Cork> munderwo: yes two ports on the same domain is seen as different hosts
[22:35:45] <tetradon> Cork: I set the value of one input to nothing
[22:35:56] <tetradon> I think there is something wrong with that actually
[22:36:00] <Cork> val('') ?
[22:36:07] <tetradon> yeah
[22:36:14] <Cork> shouldn't matter then
[22:36:31] <munderwo> Cork: right. but should that return an object from the $.ajax() function that basically is empty? ie, i've set the success and error handlers, and when the $.ajax() call returns it returns an object with those attributes = function() {not much]
[22:36:52] <munderwo> I would think that it should trigger the error handler?
[22:37:01] <Cork> munderwo: yes $.ajax returns a jqxhr object
[22:37:14] <Cork> it doesn't matter if the call can happen or not
[22:37:40] <Cork> though remeber that that object is not realated to the data sent by the server
[22:37:52] <Cork> only to the pending call to the server
[22:37:57] <munderwo> Cork: yup. but in the case of a crossDomain violation shouldnt it hit the error handler?
[22:38:05] <Cork> no
[22:38:13] <tetradon> Well not that exactly but I think it might be related to my inputs because none of them work after I submit except the one that did the submit
[22:38:28] <tetradon> but before all of them worked fine
[22:38:38] <ngharo> ?p @ tetradon
[22:38:39] <bot-t> tetradon, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:38:41] <Cork> munderwo: its a bit icky, but you don't get an error call , just a dead ajax call
[22:38:52] <munderwo> Cork: right... bugger...
[22:38:59] <ngharo> munderwo: error handler only fires on 500 errors iirc
[22:39:21] <tetradon> I can't really replicate this on one of those sites ngharo
[22:39:22] <Cork> no not only 500
[22:39:26] <munderwo> Cork: so whats the best way to get around it? if i need to do crossDomain calls (i have control over the server)
[22:39:30] <Cork> it triggers on status errors
[22:39:47] <Cork> that includes 4xx and 5xx status codes
[22:39:48] <ngharo> status?
[22:39:51] <ngharo> oh
[22:40:43] <Cork> munderwo: the gecko and chrome supports csp
[22:41:05] <Cork> you can set a header from the called domain to allow the transfer
[22:41:49] <Cork> ?mdc http access control
[22:41:51] <bot-t> Cork, Firefox 3.5 HTTP access control - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control
[22:42:09] <munderwo> see the problem is that in the log of the called server, I dont get the request.. which made me think that maybe its not even getting there?
[22:42:29] <Cork> munderwo: what browser?
[22:42:44] <munderwo> if the html/js is running on an apache server would the error be logged to the apache log... Im using chrome
[22:43:15] <Cork> munderwo: you will get an OPTION call to the server
[22:43:44] <Cork> sorry OPTIONS
[22:43:54] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#Overview
[22:44:48] <munderwo> Right! yes I get that! And i've put the Allow: 'GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS' and also 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*') headers in..
[22:45:32] <Cork> then i'm not sure why its not working for you
[22:46:25] <munderwo> Cork: yeah, also in chrome the OPTIONS request is in a pending state, so I dont get the response, but as far as the server is concerned its sent it, and when using a python script I get the response
[22:47:07] <Cork> so it fails somewhere in your apache config
[22:48:26] <Cork> munderwo: have you checked so the apache server really sets the headers you expect?
[22:49:45] <munderwo> so the html/js is running on apache. and the api that im querying is running on the command line. And im manually setting the headers in there. When I do a OPTIONs request to the api from a python script, it all works..
[22:50:07] <munderwo> when the js in apache does the request it sits in a pending state and doesnt get a response
[22:50:22] <munderwo> even though the command like output says it returned a 200
[22:50:58] <munderwo> these are the headers returned when I query it in python
[22:50:59] <munderwo> {'transfer-encoding': 'chunked', 'set-cookie': 'api_signiq_session_id=0048f186839f2b14ac515a44ec948d08878f75ce; Path=/; secure; httponly', 'server': 'localhost', 'allow': 'GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS', 'cache-control': 'no-cache, no-cache', 'date': 'Tue, 06 Mar 2012 06:50:28 GMT', 'access-control-allow-origin': '*, *', 'content-type': 'text/v1.api.signiq.com+json; charset=utf-8, text/v1.api.signiq.com+json; charset=utf-8'}
[22:56:36] <munderwo> Cork: hrmm... I think I fixed it.. I think the access-control-allow-origin: '*,*' was being set, and i've not got it to do just a single '*' and it seems to work
[23:07:29] <Heshanh> is there way to select all next() elements?
[23:47:07] <smplstk> ?nextAll @ Heshanh
[23:47:08] <caniuse> Heshanh: .nextAll(): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[23:47:29] <Xotix> How can i add some custom post data to my form's request?
[23:48:04] <smplstk> Xotix: are you using ajax?
[23:48:06] <razzle> hi, what's the easiest way to put the jquery validate text under the input field? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[23:48:14] <razzle> ie. is there a selector for it in the script ?
[23:49:27] <paissad> guys, i have this function http://pastebin.com/V6Jpgs8j & this simple html code where i want to apply the function http://pastebin.com/CLstXZY5 ... but nothing shows
[23:49:38] <paissad> what am i doing wrong ? thanks in advance.
[23:50:13] <james_oneill> When I use .append() to move an element to document.body, it duplicates the elements inside. Why is that? Is it because the elements inside were created by ExtJS?
[23:50:54] <Xotix> smplstk, No, i'd like to just add something. I could make some kind of parser to add a input to the form but maybe i can just go better. I know i could serialize the form and use $.post(), but ajax is unnecessary
[23:52:06] <smplstk> Xotix: You can add "hidden" input fields then,
[23:52:18] <smplstk> to the form that gets sent via post...
[23:52:29] <Xotix> smplstk: so i have to add input fields? i can directly add something to the request.
[23:53:17] <Xotix> pissad jsfiddle.net
[23:53:43] <smplstk> Xotix: not that I'm aware of, you'd have to use ajax do modify the post data before sending it over...
[23:53:49] <smplstk> as you previously described.
[23:54:02] <Xotix> hmm, ok. anyway isn't a big deal. thanks :)
[23:58:19] <jim_m> hi
[23:59:13] <jim_m> what techniques do people use to 'refresh' a specific div?
[23:59:44] <aro> erm.. refresh?
