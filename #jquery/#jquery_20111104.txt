[00:02:24] <patrick99e99> does anyone know if there's a way to customize safari / chrome dev tools to output useful object data?
[00:02:36] <patrick99e99> in Firefox, if I do x = {}, I see {}
[00:02:44] <patrick99e99> in safari, if I do x = {}, I see Object
[00:02:53] <patrick99e99> with a disclosure button that I have to click to see the details
[00:03:07] <patrick99e99> is there a way to make safari show the object by default?
[00:03:14] <patrick99e99> without having to click the disclosure button?
[00:08:06] <context> that button im thankful for
[00:08:24] <context> half the objects that 'auto' show will end up being huge as all hell, and useless to look at
[00:09:54] <patrick99e99> context: so the answer is no?  there's no way to get similar output to firefox's firebug?
[00:10:34] <context> i dont know
[00:10:46] <tomoyuki28jp> How can I get the header Location value from jQuery?
[00:10:49] <beasty> mornings
[00:11:07] <Cork> tomoyuki28jp: header location value?
[00:11:11] <Cork> meaning what?
[00:11:41] <tomoyuki28jp> Cork: Response header 'Location' value.
[00:12:01] <context> window.location ?
[00:12:17] <Cork> ah, you would have to look at the xhr responseHeards variable (i think its name is)
[00:12:25] <context> o!
[00:12:44] <tomoyuki28jp> Cork: thanks!
[00:13:07] <Cork> tomoyuki28jp: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLHttpRequest#getAllResponseHeaders%28%29
[00:13:52] <tomoyuki28jp> Cork: thanks a lot!!
[00:15:24] <Cork> tomoyuki28jp: or if you prefer http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[00:15:56] <Cork> tomoyuki28jp: jquery 1.5+ wrap the xhr object so the first link isn't as valid as it once was
[00:16:21] <tomoyuki28jp> Cork: thanks! the info helps me a lot!
[00:36:59] <cook1es> Cork: It definitely has something to do with nth-child, I just tried without the nth childs and got the return I wanted, except 5 elements instead of 1. Do you know if theres any other way to select the third element of a selection?
[00:38:43] <cook1es> Or maybe I should just look for a way to select the 5th element of returned set of elements.. hmm
[00:40:21] <Cork> cook1es: $().eq(5)
[00:41:09] <Cork> sorry eq(4) (0 based)
[00:43:12] * cook1es is incredibly tempted to leave it at http://localhostr.com/files/iLU8ilO/capture.png
[00:48:06] <cook1es> Cork: yep, eq() worked. :) Sweet
[00:52:34] <Xotix> hi
[00:53:47] <cook1es> Hello
[00:53:51] <Xotix> i have some drag and drop and i'm adding tr and td's on receive and change. I've applied .sortable to tbody of a table Which has nested table which are sortable. but if you resort it, the additionally added tr and td tags are still there, empty. So i need to delete them (couldn't made it sortable directly) http://pastebin.com/EjTFFZxE why does this not work?
[01:04:38] <Spikes> where should i report a bug in new jquery?
[01:07:55] <aashish> missing variable name
[01:07:58] <aashish> [Break On This Error] var this = $(this);
[01:09:05] <Cork> aashish: you cant define a variable by the name this
[01:09:22] <Cork> normally self is used
[01:09:35] <aashish> $(".submit_data").live('click', function(event) {
[01:09:37] <aashish>      /* stop form from submitting normally */
[01:09:38] <aashish>       event.preventDefault();
[01:09:40] <aashish>       var this = $(this);
[01:10:08] <Cork> yes replace var this = $(this); with var self = $(this);
[01:10:40] <Cork> this is a reserved word
[01:12:35] <jomofcw> \o/ jQuery 1.7 out. That's a nice thing.
[01:13:03] <Spikes> jomofcw, nope, quite some bugs
[01:13:23] <aashish> how can access ajax response json, outside ajax block
[01:13:46] <Cork> aashish: its the first parameter returned to your success block
[01:14:34] <aashish> yes ofcourse, i want to get that out of ajax block
[01:14:59] <Cork> aashish: ah, as ajax is async you basically can't
[01:15:09] <aashish> k
[01:15:17] <Cork> you can store it in a global varialbe, but you don't know when it will be set
[01:15:30] <Cork> it can be a sec after the function ends or several minutes
[01:16:18] <jomofcw> Spikes that's why it will up fixes ;). But a major version is always nice, because it means it still a maintained project ^^.
[01:16:56] <Spikes> jomofcw, yeah, right now i actually won't advice using it anyway
[01:17:10] <Spikes> jomofcw, especialy if you rely on jquery ui
[01:25:56] <juha_> gj jquery, releasing version after version and i'm still stuck at 1.4.2 ugh
[01:25:57] <juha_> :D
[01:27:04] <Spikes> well, new version is quite speedy, i believe
[01:27:16] <Spikes> i'd say that's a good reason to update
[01:28:30] <juha_> will the .on() be replacing .delegate() etc?
[01:29:07] <jomofcw> Spikes I just update it on one fo my website, where I use jquery ui... and all seems to be OK :/.
[01:31:08] <Cork> juha_: no looks like on will be another shorthand
[01:31:17] <Spikes> jomofcw, what plugins do you use? right now i've found problems with selectable and partly draggable/sortable
[01:31:22] <Cork> juha_: just like get and post is for ajax
[01:35:14] <jomofcw> Spikes I don't use those :/. Just use the dialog and the datepiker mainly.
[01:35:34] <amh345> i just loaded a simple popup with absolute position and a z-index.  what's the simplest way for me to be able to click outside that div and have it close?
[01:35:36] <wica> Hello
[01:36:07] <Spikes> jomofcw, i'm not sure if datepicker uses event.metaKey check, but if it does, than there'll be a problem
[01:36:25] <wica> I have in css; .bla { color: red; }; how do I get the value from the property color from this class?
[01:37:05] <Cork> amh345: $(document.body).one('click', function() { remove-dialog; }); $('your-dialog').click(function(event){ event.stopPropagation(); });
[01:38:20] <aashish> $(".submit_data").live('click', function(event) {
[01:38:22] <aashish>  
[01:38:23] <aashish> 	 	event.preventDefault();
[01:38:25] <aashish> 	 	var self= $(this);
[01:38:26] <aashish> alert(self);
[01:38:28] <aashish> is empty why?
[01:38:39] <Cork> aashish: stop posting multible lines in the channel
[01:38:48] <Cork> use a pastbin instad
[01:38:50] <Spikes> amh345, dunno, maybe something like $(document).on('click', function(e) { // here check if e.target is modal window/ it's parent is't modal window // hide modal window});
[01:39:14] <amh345> Cork: what is remove-dialog?
[01:39:27] <Cork> amh345: your code for removing the dialog
[01:39:35] <amh345> oh. aha
[01:40:08] <Spikes> amh345, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-to-detect-a-click-outside-an-element check first answer
[01:41:37] <Cork> Spikes: you'll have to remember to remove the listner if you do it your way
[01:41:53] <aashish> http://pastie.org/2808850  can u help
[01:44:21] <Cork> aashish: http://jsfiddle.net/YxqpK/
[01:45:51] <amh345> this $(document.body).one('click', function() { remove-dialog; }); $('your-dialog').click(function(event){ event.stopPropagation(); });    appears to close it once.. but i dont think it allows me to open it again when i click on the popup link
[01:46:14] <aashish> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/YxqpK/
[01:46:34] <Cork> amh345: yes, it removes its binding when its done
[01:46:47] <aashish> why i am not getting  html
[01:46:58] <amh345> is there a way to prevent that from being removed? just to hide it?
[01:47:07] <Cork> if you want it to trigger on every click you need to use bind instead, or rebind it on displaying the dialog
[01:47:45] <amh345> oh. i just killed the 'your-diag'.click and it seems to have done the trick
[01:48:13] <Cork> amh345: bind it as a one then
[01:48:20] <Cork> oh no btw that won't work
[01:48:21] <amh345> wait. it didnt do the trick
[01:48:33] <amh345> man im so friggin tired
[01:48:45] <Cork> amh345: its the .one that does it
[01:48:54] <Cork> it reacts on one click then dies
[01:49:21] <Cork> aashish: i donno what your asking about
[01:49:56] <amh345> oh i see. i made .one .click and i think it's doing it now
[01:50:10] <Spikes> what
[02:01:50] <Aruna> Hi
[02:02:25] <Aruna> I am using Jquery 1.6.4 .. In $.ajax  method my success callback thing is not working
[02:02:37] <KOTRET> how to abort / revert a click on a ui  $(...).button() if its clicked?
[02:02:49] <Aruna> Ajax request is done but the callback function is not happening
[02:03:54] <Aruna> The same way .live is not happening but bind is working
[02:04:05] <Aruna> Can anybody tell me why it is happening so?
[02:04:19] <KOTRET> Aruna: sure the call is successfull?
[02:04:32] <Aruna> yes I am sure
[02:04:48] <Aruna> it gives 304 Ok
[02:05:44] <juha_> lol, i tagged jquery on a tweet and immediately got three followers
[02:07:48] <sente> there's too much jquery noise on the twitters, and blogs which just recycle the same content over and over
[02:07:57] <sente> makes it annoying to actually find/compare plugins and such
[02:14:12] <Logitec> Hello, I am doing price calculations in a table generated by javascript code, when a minus or plus button is clicked, i call a function calculateRowPrice(i, amount): i being the row index, amount being the amount to order, then it changes the innerhtml of that row
[02:14:49] <Logitec> now I want to calculate a subtotal at the bottom of this specific section, I'm using an ID but i have nowhere to get the right index number from
[02:15:23] <Logitec> any idea's?
[02:20:45] <Spikes> can u make a jsfiddle example?
[02:20:48] <benitofish> why is #php invite only?
[02:21:29] <JackBauer24> benitofish: my guess is too many people and too many newbies without Google search ability
[02:21:55] <JackBauer24> or even manual reading
[02:22:03] <sjeijk> can some1 point me into the right direction to improve the next code?
[02:22:10] <sjeijk> $('#products > *').hover(function(){
[02:22:10] <sjeijk> 		        $('#navigation').css('backgroundPosition', '0 -40px');
[02:22:10] <sjeijk> 		    }, function(){
[02:22:11] <sjeijk> 		        $('#navigation').css('backgroundPosition', '0 0');
[02:22:11] <sjeijk> 		    });
[02:22:12] <sjeijk> 		    $('#services > *').hover(function(){
[02:22:12] <sjeijk> 		        $('#navigation').css('backgroundPosition', '0 -80px');

[02:22:13] <sjeijk> 		    });
[02:22:13] <sjeijk> 		    $('#download > *').hover(function(){
[02:22:14] <Spikes> omg
[02:22:14] <sjeijk> 		        $('#navigation').css('backgroundPosition', '0 -120px');
[02:22:14] <sjeijk> 		    }, function(){
[02:22:16] <Spikes> dude
[02:22:18] <JackBauer24> wtf
[02:22:21] <Spikes> use pastebin
[02:23:56] <Spikes> seems like a mess of a code that i'm not exactly sure what it's for and i;'m not that interested in finding out
[02:24:02] <benitofish> @jackbauer: yeh probably. well i have one tiny little problem but i dont know what to search
[02:24:19] <benitofish> any of you know basic php who can help me out ! it'll take like 30 seconds if you know php
[02:25:03] <Logitec> quick question: trim 2 characters to the left of an innerHTML, which method to use?
[02:25:16] <Spikes> benitofish, shoot
[02:25:32] <benitofish> spikes: http://pastebin.com/fnvmenD5
[02:25:41] <benitofish> see where i'm defining $current_tag
[02:25:47] <Logitec> left(string, 2) ? substr(string, 2) ?
[02:25:49] <benitofish> and then calling it again in the line below
[02:26:12] <benitofish> i need to wrap the value of $current_tag in apostrophes so it works when a tag with a space in it is called
[02:26:42] <benitofish> but nomatter where i try to wrap it with apostrophes, it thinks im trying to do some php stuff and not just put apostrophes :(
[02:26:53] <benitofish> i've tried doing ' . ' . '
[02:27:03] <Spikes> benitofish, try this one: http://pastebin.com/kKfB6FEA
[02:27:43] <Spikes> you have to escape ' character with backslash
[02:27:53] <benitofish> i tried that! no luck.
[02:27:58] <benitofish> no luck with yours either :(
[02:28:08] <Spikes> hmm
[02:28:20] <JackBauer24> benitofish: it's impossible, that's the way it's done
[02:28:44] <benitofish> well
[02:28:57] <benitofish> with your method, the single tags still get called properly!
[02:28:58] <Spikes> i'm not sure what WP_Query does, so maybe something within it?
[02:29:12] <benitofish> so maybe its got something to do with the space
[02:31:00] <benitofish> yep okay, i think its putting the apostrophes in with your method
[02:31:03] <Spikes> benitofish, try this one: http://pastebin.com/EPhutDP1. if not working then you'd better investigate WP_Query
[02:31:34] <Spikes> maybe try using " instead of '
[02:32:24] <benitofish> nup
[02:32:30] <benitofish> all of those work with single words though
[02:32:40] <benitofish> so i'm guessing its the way wp_query deals with spaces
[02:33:04] <Spikes> try to var_dump($current_tag) to find what's inside
[02:33:42] <Spikes> what's WP_Query? Word Press class to fetch data from DB?
[02:34:08] <benitofish> yep
[02:34:35] <Spikes> ok, when does the problem occur exactly?
[02:34:58] <benitofish> when there is a space in the tag
[02:35:01] <benitofish> when trying to reach
[02:35:10] <benitofish> for example, www.website.com/tag/whatevertaghere
[02:35:25] <benitofish> if whatevertaghere is a single word, all is good
[02:35:47] <Spikes> ah, when "tag" part looks like "www.website.com/tag hurr durr/whatevertaghere"?
[02:35:47] <cedeon> Logitec: if you are after a performance related answer check out this page for comparisons: http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-substr-vs-substring-vs-split-vs-regexp/2
[02:36:07] <benitofish> spikes: more like website.com/tag/multiple word tag/
[02:36:19] <Spikes> right
[02:36:54] <Spikes> benitofish, http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp_query-no-space-in-arguments
[02:37:22] <Spikes> and this one: http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/21446/tag-search-using-wp-query
[02:38:16] <Owkkuri> benitofish: try this version http://pastebin.com/jr5DRy5c perhaps
[02:39:55] <benitofish> okay i've found what's wrong but dunno how to fix it
[02:39:59] <benitofish> so the correct thing to query
[02:40:05] <benitofish> is 'multiple-word'
[02:40:22] <benitofish> but you've helped me query 'multiple word'
[02:40:32] <benitofish> haha
[02:41:21] <benitofish> so i need to write something to rplace every space in $current_tag with a dash instead
[02:41:29] <benitofish> right?
[02:42:03] <Spikes> do you have slug field in your DB table for tags?
[02:42:57] <benitofish> im looking for that now, otherwise will need to filter that space which i dont know how lol
[02:43:19] <Spikes> str_replace(" ","_",$currentTag); ?
[02:44:30] <benitofish> hmm that doesnt work
[02:44:39] <benitofish> i put that after the $current_tag definitino
[02:45:54] <Cork> benitofish: are you reassigning it?
[02:46:02] <Cork> str_replace returns the updated value
[02:46:39] <Spikes> $currentTag = str_replace(" ","_",$currentTag); - that's how it should look like
[02:46:57] <Spikes> replace curentTag with current_tag
[02:47:08] <Spikes> camel case ftw
[02:48:23] <benitofish> this is what ive got: http://pastebin.com/MB0d4TpG but it doesnt work
[02:48:30] <benitofish> just returns every post
[02:48:49] <Spikes> you forgot $currentTag
[02:48:58] <Spikes> change it to $current_tag
[02:49:21] <benitofish> i redefined it as current_tag_slug ?
[02:49:37] <Cork> benitofish: the source variable doesn't exist
[02:49:56] <Cork> "-",$currentTag); should be "-",$current_tag);
[02:50:26] <benitofish> YES
[02:50:33] <benitofish> ahhhhh
[02:50:35] <benitofish> :D
[02:50:54] <benitofish> ty cork & spikes !
[02:51:04] <benitofish> super helpful.
[02:51:08] <Cork> Spikes did all the work :)
[02:51:22] <benitofish> haha
[02:51:26] <benitofish> ty spikes :P
[02:52:05] <johnywp> hey all
[02:52:10] <Spikes> i know that feeling. when i was just starting to learn php i too had problems with reading and understanding the code. It was amazing that i managed to spend hours on hours dealing with tiny little bugs that i just didn't understand
[02:52:26] <Spikes> such a great feeling when you finally fix the problem :)
[02:52:44] <benitofish> yeh! there are things which i've spent maybe 10 hours on (not kidding) which someone who knew a bit of php could have just told me in 2 seconds
[02:53:12] <Spikes> you'll get better
[02:55:06] <benitofish> hah i hope so
[02:56:49] <Spikes> well, look at me, i've learned pascal programming only in my last grade in high school, then studied journalistics for 5 years in Uni. And what i do? Programming. And i hate math
[02:58:10] <johnywp> would $("a.hello").click(); actually CLICK (as in trigger the href of) <a href=... class="hello">?
[02:58:23] <Spikes> nope
[02:58:57] <johnywp> hm
[02:59:10] <johnywp> syntax error?
[02:59:45] <JackBauer24> johnywp: click() method must have a handler
[03:00:06] <benitofish> haha spikes
[03:00:06] <Spikes> indeed click(function() {hurr durrr});
[03:00:11] <JackBauer24> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[03:00:14] <benitofish> programming is kind of fun when you achieve something
[03:00:44] <johnywp> so, how would you rewrite that to achieve the desired effect? if possible that is
[03:01:27] <JackBauer24> johnywp: just do redirection to the address of "a" element
[03:01:30] <ravenzz> when you write a web service for an health care service of an hospital is no that fun
[03:01:32] <ravenzz> :p
[03:01:33] <Spikes> benitofish, yeah, i just wish that some forms of it could be cnsidered as art and got attention of public - like great drawings or music etc
[03:02:03] <Spikes> benitofish, but that's a bit crazy idea which wouldn't be possible in real life world
[03:03:44] <johnywp> JackBauer24: at the example at the end, it says $("p").click(); which is what I am doing, right?
[03:04:11] <JackBauer24> johnwp: click is an event handler, it doesn't perform a click
[03:04:31] <JackBauer24> google "javascript redirect"
[03:05:23] <johnywp> oh
[03:05:25] <johnywp> now i get it
[03:05:29] <Spikes> hmm, why doesn't selectable plugin support shiftKey option - select range of elements from first selected element to the last one...
[03:05:43] <johnywp> so, what I am trying to do is impossible..
[03:06:13] <JackBauer24> johnywp: redirections in JavaScript are possible
[03:06:22] <aaronmcadam> lol wut
[03:06:29] <aaronmcadam> that's wrong
[03:07:06] <ravenzz> johnywp http://jsfiddle.net/vr4Wd/
[03:07:08] <johnywp> but i am not trying to achieve a redirection in this case
[03:07:27] <JackBauer24> then what?
[03:07:29] <aaronmcadam> JackBauer24: you're wrong about click too, it can trigger a click
[03:07:40] <johnywp> ravenzz! that's interesting
[03:08:03] <johnywp> but you had to use href
[03:08:12] <ravenzz> it's an example:o
[03:08:12] <johnywp> which wouldn't work in my case
[03:08:32] <ravenzz> you can select the element in any way
[03:08:36] <aaronmcadam> johnywp: there's nothing stopping u at all from using document.location = 'url'
[03:08:53] <johnywp> true... the problem is that I don't have an actual url
[03:09:11] <aaronmcadam> johnywp: there's nothing stopping u at all from using document.location = $('#link')[0].href
[03:09:13] <ravenzz> can you describe what are you trying to do?
[03:09:29] <johnywp> it's simply <a class="fb_button fb_button_medium">
[03:09:43] <johnywp> ravenzz: I have a facebook login button
[03:09:48] <aaronmcadam> it needs a href to work
[03:09:59] <ravenzz> ok go ahead
[03:10:13] <blackspotwiggins>  johnywp a click() on <a> with no href produces no results - and it surprises you?
[03:10:18] <johnywp> i want to display it within a modal box
[03:10:35] <aaronmcadam> johnywp: add 'href="javascript:void(0)"'
[03:10:38] <johnywp> when i try to make it render in my html
[03:10:45] <ravenzz> aaronmcadam don't do that :o
[03:10:55] <aaronmcadam> it's better than using hash link
[03:11:05] <aaronmcadam> nothing wrong with it
[03:11:05] <johnywp> it works... but when I try to render it in my modal box it doesn't
[03:11:13] <JackBauer24> aaronmcadam: it's true that click() can trigger an event, but you still need a handler to take some action. He was asking about real click on the link.
[03:11:26] <johnywp> so, i was thinking of somehow triggering the event of the actual button through the click of a random link
[03:11:38] <aaronmcadam> no u don't
[03:11:47] <aaronmcadam> you don't need a callback to trigger any event
[03:11:56] <aaronmcadam> it would just do the default action
[03:12:10] <JackBauer24> which is none in this case?
[03:12:19] <aaronmcadam> cuz he's not added a href
[03:12:25] <aaronmcadam> *nothing* gets fired
[03:12:44] <JackBauer24> it doesn't redirect even with href
[03:12:48] <ravenzz> aaronmcadam the crappy fb button doesn't have an href, so it is invalid by default, an href="javascript:void(0)" won't help
[03:12:56] <johnywp> exactly
[03:13:03] <blackspotwiggins> explain this
[03:13:19] <aaronmcadam> ravenzz: void is for links that are js specific anyway
[03:13:43] <aaronmcadam> you need a href attr for a link to fire
[03:13:47] <ravenzz> johnywp can you provide a demo? maybe there is a way to make your modal working
[03:14:49] <johnywp> sure - let me try
[03:17:36] <Xotix> How do i make a old simple pop up with jquery? like window.open in JS.
[03:18:01] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, window.open
[03:18:13] <blackspotwiggins> jquery is not a different language
[03:18:14] <aaronmcadam> hahah :D
[03:18:32] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins: isn't there a plugin? :(
[03:18:39] <blackspotwiggins> better write one
[03:19:07] <aaronmcadam> jesus we need more education out there, that question is pretty bad lol :D
[03:19:29] <Xotix> maybe they made a function with some fixed. IE rly hates the name parameter of window.open
[03:19:51] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, comes with the community/being popular
[03:20:20] <blackspotwiggins> but think of it this way - the shittier the average jquery "developer" is, the higher your value
[03:20:28] <aaronmcadam> yeah I know but you don't get python guys looking for django ways of doing standard stuff
[03:21:02] <blackspotwiggins> more accessibility -> nobody wants to learn anything
[03:21:06] <aaronmcadam> in my experience, there's a *lot* of shit jquery devs
[03:21:19] <blackspotwiggins> think what would happen if everyone could be a pilot as easy as they get a drivers license
[03:21:22] <blackspotwiggins> :)
[03:21:26] <aaronmcadam> or javascript in general, just like php
[03:21:37] <Spikes> fuck, i'd crash my plane for sure
[03:21:50] <Xotix> why should this be such a terrible question? IE doesn't support the name parameter so maybe jQuery does it better.
[03:22:00] <blackspotwiggins> Spikes, yeah, right now you might create a huge security hole and leak your users data
[03:22:00] <aaronmcadam> what does the name param do
[03:22:03] <Spikes> i wanted to be a pilot, but i was and still sure that i'd crash anything
[03:22:17] <blackspotwiggins> doesnt seem as tangible threat
[03:22:32] <blackspotwiggins> so yeah, go work for sony or smth :)
[03:22:40] <Spikes> blackspotwiggins, well, so far it's been fine :)
[03:22:50] <blackspotwiggins> Spikes, how do you know?
[03:22:59] <blackspotwiggins> if i mined some sites data
[03:23:02] <blackspotwiggins> i wouldnt tell them
[03:23:10] <Spikes> blackspotwiggins, because i can read and understand what i wrote
[03:23:58] <zalun> is there a jQueryLint for 1.7?
[03:25:04] <aaronmcadam> why don't u ask padolsey
[03:25:14] <johnywp> ok
[03:25:15] <johnywp> http://jsfiddle.net/MLgHK/1/
[03:25:33] <aaronmcadam> last commit june 13 so no
[03:25:35] <johnywp> at the moment, I am having another issue, but I am sure that this one has to do with syntax
[03:25:39] <aaronmcadam> https://github.com/jamespadolsey/jQuery-Lint
[03:25:49] <JackBauer24> Xotix: http://labs.wondergroup.com/frameworks/jquery-popup-plugin/ 5 seconds google search
[03:25:55] <johnywp> i get gofb is not defined
[03:26:33] <Xotix> JackBauer24:  it's a pop up. that must be possible without a pluginâ€¦ but thanks
[03:26:44] <aaronmcadam> zalun: how does it fare out as is
[03:27:00] <JackBauer24> Xotix: yes, it is possible in pure javascript which is simple enough
[03:27:03] <zalun> no idea - I've got one which was tested with .6
[03:27:15] <zalun> now I'm downloading the one from June
[03:27:15] <JackBauer24> if you desperatly want it in jQuery style, then a plugin is a way to go
[03:28:14] <johnywp> ravenzz: in this case, you can see the fb button render normally in the html but not within the dialog box
[03:28:26] <Xotix> JackBauer24, IE8 doesn't load the PDF im opening in the pop up. Thats why i asked this "stupid" question. Normaly, jQuery does it better.
[03:29:12] <JackBauer24> Xotix: it's a fault of IE's plugin, javascript can't touch it
[03:29:22] <JackBauer24> unless you would want to create your own PDF reader
[03:29:52] <aaronmcadam> oh great :D
[03:30:14] <ravenzz> johnywp i can't see any dialog box
[03:30:21] <aaronmcadam> wonder how chrome would open it
[03:30:40] <johnywp> do you see any syntax in the js? for some reason I get "gofb is not defined"
[03:31:50] <johnywp> syntax error that is
[03:32:21] <smk74> Hi folks!
[03:33:34] <smk74> Can somebody help me? I have very wierd issue (not directly Jquery related), code snippet:  win_obj_ref = window.open('/search_fractions','_blank'); // win_obj_ref is global variable here
[03:34:22] <smk74> in response server return a page with different resources attached (incl. jquery library)
[03:34:28] <zalun> aaronmcadam: the one from June looks fine (no errors on empty fiddle)
[03:34:30] <zalun> thx
[03:34:48] <zalun> so, jQuery 1.7 is implemented on jsFiddle
[03:34:50] <zalun> enjoy
[03:34:57] <Spikes> oh, fun
[03:35:04] <ravenzz> johnywp http://jsfiddle.net/MLgHK/3/
[03:35:10] <smk74> i can't access  win_obj_ref.$  from javascript code   (get undefined)  but can in js console (verified in Chrome and FF)
[03:35:14] <Spikes> and with jquery ui too
[03:35:53] <johnywp> ty for that ravenzz! so, now it looks exactly like on my site
[03:36:10] <johnywp> as you can see, the fb button doesn't render in the dialog box
[03:36:13] <zalun> but the 1.8.16 - google api says it's the latest one
[03:36:20] <aaronmcadam> zalun: just use edge
[03:36:26] <ravenzz> johnywp the error one?
[03:36:33] <zalun> aaronmcadam: do you have a link?
[03:36:42] <smk74> i.e.  typeof(win_obj_ref.$) is function in js console
[03:36:47] <aaronmcadam> zalun: in fiddle i mean, it pulls in the latest git commit
[03:36:49] <zalun> and it will change in time
[03:36:55] <johnywp> no, yours. while <div class="fb-login-button">Login with Facebook</div> renders the button in html
[03:36:56] <AhoOo> Hi, I have a problem with hovering. I have a div which when you hover over it shows a popup window. But sometimes mouseleave does not trigger, so the popup window stays open. This mostly happen if you drag the mouse fast. Is there any solution to this?
[03:37:03] <zalun> so it's not ideal
[03:37:08] <johnywp> it doesn't render the button in the dialog box
[03:37:08] <aaronmcadam> yes it is
[03:37:15] <smk74> any ideas?
[03:37:26] <zalun> ok - /me has to fly
[03:37:47] <zalun> flying to London today ... heh ... anyone going for a MozFest today?
[03:38:00] <johnywp> instead, it just renders the text
[03:38:32] <ravenzz> oh I see
[03:39:01] <ravenzz> so you want the login button twice
[03:39:15] <ravenzz> I mean in the dialogbox too
[03:39:15] <johnywp> nah - ideally it would just show once and in the dialog box
[03:39:23] <johnywp> that's the goal
[03:40:01] <johnywp> but if that's not possible (doesn't seem to be), i could show the button once in the html and somehow trigger it with a link in the dialog box
[03:40:09] <olivvv> hello
[03:40:27] <olivvv> i found this in some code : $(d).find(":rd(fooWidget)").
[03:40:55] <olivvv> can someone tell me what it is querying the dom for ?
[03:41:18] <rosieres> Noob: -> how do i call an element after this ?? -> $(this ul).makeSome("foo");
[03:41:44] <aaronmcadam> what?
[03:42:01] <rosieres> i don´t get the ul called
[03:42:15] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ rosieres
[03:42:16] <bot-t> rosieres, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:42:30] <johnywp> do you think it could potentially render within the dialog box?
[03:42:32] <aaronmcadam> use an example that will actually work
[03:42:45] <Spikes> rosieres, $(this).find('ul').hurrdurr
[03:42:49] <rosieres> just thought, it´s so short that´s not neccesscary
[03:43:05] <ravenzz> johnywp yes, hold on
[03:43:13] <aaronmcadam> ah u meant the this keyword ok
[03:43:37] <johnywp> ok - holding on with mucho excitement
[03:44:24] <rosieres> @spikes -> thank you !
[03:44:29] <Spikes> rosieres, np
[03:45:58] <smk74> anyone can point me how to access properties of DOMWindow of newly created window with loaded page  from js code (see above)?
[03:47:52] <smk74> repeat: win_obj_ref = window.open('/search_fractions','_blank'); // win_obj_ref.$ is undefined here .. but manual check in browser js console  return jquery function
[03:48:25] <Spikes> smk47, what does console.log(win_obj_ref) returns?
[03:49:07] <smk74> @Spikes  DOMWindow .. in console everything works fine but not in js code
[03:49:41] <aaronmcadam> what happens if u say win_obj_ref.location = 'bla
[03:49:41] <smk74> @Spikes - i'm trying to use qunit to test js code in new window
[03:50:05] <aaronmcadam> smk74: are you sure that's correct
[03:51:56] <smk74> @aaronmcadam  - i can assign any property to win_obj_ref - no problem  but can't read existed ones only from js code  (again in console eveything works fine) .. it drives me crazy
[03:52:19] <aaronmcadam> i think ur doing it wrong
[03:52:33] <aaronmcadam> every qunit test suite i've seen does it all in one window
[03:53:31] <smk74> @aaraonmcadam  for now i'm trying to get Jquery object to control page in new window
[03:54:11] <aaronmcadam> good luck
[03:54:30] <smk74> @aaraonmcadam  for example this works fine in console :  win_obj_ref.$('#container .main form').attr('action')    .. but not in js code
[03:55:13] <aaronmcadam> scoping
[03:55:18] <aaronmcadam> probably why
[03:55:35] <aaronmcadam> if ur running at from a test
[03:56:00] <aaronmcadam> smk74: try using $.proxy maybe but it still seem s wrong
[03:56:10] <smk74> so the main question is why it works in browser js console  of main page   but not in js file
[03:56:29] <aaronmcadam> test what the scope is
[03:56:33] <ravenzz> johnywp http://jsfiddle.net/754hN/
[03:56:41] <aaronmcadam> firebug runs from the window all the time
[03:57:11] <smk74> i'm working primary in Chrome .. but this issues exist in FF, Opera
[03:57:49] <aaronmcadam> web inspector would be the same
[03:58:40] <johnywp> thank you so much ravenzz! It's so close, but it's not clickable
[03:58:48] <johnywp> http://jsfiddle.net/754hN/1/
[03:58:59] <johnywp> i updated the code just to make the dialog box stay open
[03:59:32] <johnywp> that doesn't make sense, does it?you are printing the html output of the fb button into the dialog box
[03:59:47] <johnywp> but... it's not clickable
[03:59:52] <johnywp> beats me!
[03:59:55] <lampe> hi
[04:00:45] <lampe> are there any known problems that jquery breaks javascript Math or similar? I have a problem with following.. calculation
[04:00:46] <lampe> C9 = Math.exp(-(timestampAktuell-(sprayingTimeDuration+dt)) * pumpingSpeed/volumeWert) * E2;
[04:01:18] <lampe> in my test.html it works good.. but in my index.html it doesnt.. the odd thing ist that all variable values are equal.. any ideas?
[04:01:20] <Mads> I was just wondering! Any danes in here?
[04:02:52] <smk74> @aaraonmcadam  console.log(web_obj_ref)  ; // this shows entire DOMWindow with attached $ at the root .. but still can't access from js code  (qunit is disable  - called from raw js function)
[04:04:30] <lampe> I am using jquery.mobile-1.0rc2.min.js, jQuery v1.6.4 and jquery.jqplot.1.0.0b2_r947
[04:07:57] <rosieres> Noob: How can I prevent this flickering @ hovering the following li or how can I make this smarter at all http://jsfiddle.net/GwtnB/1/
[04:12:48] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/MSCPy5Ee why can't i use remove() like that but e.G. can do .html("test"); ?
[04:13:51] <Zerxer> what happens when you do it
[04:14:42] <Zerxer> a table still has to have the same number of columns for each row (unless a row has the colspan set higher than 1)
[04:14:49] <Zerxer> so by removing a td, it's still going to fill it in on its own
[04:15:06] <Zerxer> but if it still has the td there with the html/text in it, then I don't know
[04:15:11] <Xotix> No error occurs, but if i inspect the element, the empty <tr> tags are still there.
[04:15:23] <Zerxer> oh
[04:15:31] <Zerxer> well you're looping over td
[04:15:32] <Zerxer> not tr
[04:15:34] <johnywp> ravenzz: any more ideas? thanks you either way for all the help :)
[04:15:48] <Zerxer> so you're not removing empty <tr> tags, you're removing empty <td> tags
[04:15:57] <Zerxer> (which then may produce empty <tr> tags)
[04:15:59] <Xotix> ah i forgot the parent
[04:16:37] <Xotix> thanks
[04:16:50] <Zerxer> killing the parent if they have no grandchildren
[04:16:51] <Zerxer> what a world
[04:17:50] <Xotix> :)
[04:17:53] <lampe> the failing calculation only appears if I get the Values of some sliders like this
[04:17:54] <lampe> pumpingSpeed = $("#sliderPumpingSpeed-0").val();
[04:18:17] <lampe> there are 6 sliders.. if I set the values directly anything works fine..
[04:18:35] <lampe> the values directly to the variables w/o the sliders
[04:18:56] <lampe> it seems like a bug for me or do I miss something?
[04:41:49] <lampe> the magic word is "parseFloat()"..
[04:56:51] <especially-corn> hello :) i have a problem, i'm trying to extract something from a specific paragraph within a div but i'm having little luck, here's how the div and jquery function looks like http://paste.ubuntu.com/728095/
[04:59:00] <anvandare> especially-corn: try $('#6274 > .box,.d).html()
[04:59:19] <anvandare> err, add an ' before that ).html();
[05:00:44] <especially-corn> what should that return?
[05:01:11] <especially-corn> i
[05:01:15] <especially-corn> im interested in getting the date
[05:01:17] <ravenzz> are you trying to select any paragraph that is child of a div that has not the .box class?
[05:01:23] <especially-corn> from the paragraph outside of the box div
[05:01:38] <ravenzz> ..
[05:01:46] <ravenzz> $('p.date')
[05:01:47] <especially-corn> i want to select the date paragraph from every div
[05:01:47] <ravenzz> lol
[05:01:58] <especially-corn> but i need to be inside the div
[05:02:03] <especially-corn> to take the div id
[05:02:10] <guy> there is event propery client{X,Y} and what's the other one?
[05:02:26] <ravenzz> $('p.date').parent() is #6273
[05:04:35] <especially-corn> sweet man!
[05:04:41] <especially-corn> thank you very much
[05:05:27] <ravenzz> guy what?
[05:05:39] <guy> page{X,Y} was what I've meant
[05:05:55] <ravenzz> you need to get its position?
[05:06:24] <guy> yes. I needed to get the absolute position of the click, rather than relative.
[05:11:26] <ravenzz> ?position @ guy
[05:11:26] <bot-t> guy, .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[05:11:44] <guy> "relative to the offset parent"
[05:11:57] <ravenzz> sorry
[05:11:58] <ravenzz> offset
[05:12:01] <guy> yes.
[05:12:13] <ravenzz> ?offset
[05:12:13] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[05:12:32] <guy> though, I prefer plain JS when there are no cross-browser compatibility known issues.
[05:13:10] <Younos> hi folks, how can i make my jsfiddle's public or private if i have such a fiddle in my dashboard?
[05:14:47] <Derppy> Is is possible to modify the value of active input field? Trying to remove bad characters if the user tries to write them, but setting a new value with val() while the user is writing doesn't seem to work.
[05:15:19] <ravenzz> guy isn't offset crossbrowser?
[05:16:00] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Derppy
[05:16:00] <bot-t> Derppy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:16:40] <guy> offset{Top, Right, Bottom, Left} is perfectly crossbrowser
[05:16:53] <ravenzz> so what?
[05:17:18] <guy> so thats why I am using plain JS... what the issue about?
[05:29:58] <elektryk> Hi, i wroted script to autovalidate form. For text inputs I use keyup to do something when user input a letter. But it doesnt work when user choose something from browser's suggestion list. How i should recognize this?
[05:33:53] <ravenzz> elektryk you could validate the input field on blur/focusout
[05:35:31] <elektryk> but it still not resolve my problem
[05:35:47] <elektryk> i thing that this is impossible
[05:35:50] <elektryk> think*
[05:37:02] <ravenzz> I have to go
[05:37:09] <ravenzz> hold on, someone will help you
[05:37:39] <erichynds> yea, you have to do blur/focusout
[05:45:30] <Xotix> how can i disable sorting of one specific element? e.g. my ul is sortable but the li with the ID X shouldn't be sortable.
[05:48:17] <sadmicrowave> Xotix, can you not: $( "#X" ).sortable({ disabled: true });
[05:48:52] <sadmicrowave> that may only work for the entire sortable container, but it is a possibility
[05:51:18] <Xotix> no.
[05:52:17] <Xotix> But could i remove the ui-sortable class?
[06:01:16] <lokodomain> hey
[06:01:48] <dogan> hello, i use this code $("#contextMenu a").live('click', function(){
[06:02:11] <dogan> first time i click a link it pops one pop up (code runs once) but second time runs twice and so on
[06:02:39] <erichynds> dogan: you must be rebinding the handler over and over
[06:02:53] <dogan> how to stop this?
[06:03:18] <dogan> $("#contextMenu a").click( function(){ dont work
[06:03:31] <lokodomain> anyone used cropzoom plugin
[06:03:32] <erichynds> where in your code are you binding the listener
[06:03:32] <erichynds> ?p
[06:03:33] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:03:38] <dogan> and $('body').delegate('#contextMenu a', 'click', function(){ does the same
[06:03:56] <lokodomain> http://www.cropzoom.com.ar/
[06:05:53] <ironfroggy__> serious question: are bind, delegate, live, etc. deprecated or going to be, in favor of on/off ?
[06:06:42] <dogan> so is there a way to check if event is already binded so don't bind it again?
[06:08:57] <erichynds> dogan: your code is in a spot where it keeps getting bound over and over
[06:09:02] <erichynds> so move it out of that spot
[06:19:18] <{-_-\\\> hi
[06:19:28] <{-_-\\\> what is the best way to check for non-graphical browsers?
[06:19:36] <{-_-\\\> and draw images in ascii-art
[06:21:03] <Xotix> Any tips on ow to manage my jQuery Code if i have a bit more of it? Just in a procedural style? Or is there some good idea form managing it? Like MVC in other language. e.G.
[06:21:05] <Logitec> Hello, how can I stop my javascript from seeing a var as a string? (I want to add 2 variable values, but it outputs value 1+value2 instead of value3)

[06:41:28] <Xotix> If i want to select class X in element with ID Z, how do i do that?
[06:43:58] <Haprog> Xotix: $('#Z .X')
[06:45:05] <Xotix> hm hen i got a issue somewhere else, thanks
[06:45:07] <Xotix> t
[06:49:26] <Xotix> I have 2 containers. A and B. You can drag from A to B some elements. Some elements have a class. Because of this class, .live('dblclick' gets added to them but they should only be clickable in container B not A. What's the best way to solve that?
[06:52:20] <Logitec> kborchers: Sorry, I can't get a demo to work.
[06:52:34] <Logitec> kborchers: I am generating a table, a lot of dynamic things involved
[06:53:58] <nFFF> How do you change the color of text for isntance on the click of a button
[06:54:31] <Xotix> onlick"$(xxx).css('color', 'red')
[06:55:37] <Xotix> nFFF or $('.button').live('click', function() { use .css() here });
[06:56:10] <nFFF> Xotix, whats the difference between the two functions and which is better
[06:56:45] <Xotix> onclick="" is added directly to te HTML Element. use the 2nd.
[06:58:09] <nFFF> $('.button').live('click', function() {  $(#randomid).css('background-position','0 -30px')  });
[06:58:14] <nFFF> is this right?
[06:59:27] <Xotix> yes, just try it out.
[07:03:35] <{-_-\\\> what is the best way to run website on dynamic-ip server, to minimize its downtime during ip changes/dns updates?
[07:12:07] <ironfroggy__> {^_^\\\: best way? dont. why bother? you can get a cheap server for 5-10 bucks a month. you can get an ec2 micro for free, even.
[07:12:34] <{^_^\\\> no, dynamic ip is required
[07:12:37] <ironfroggy__> and if you dont have any backend processes, you can host static stuff as a github page, or one of many other options that dont cost you a dime.
[07:12:44] <ironfroggy__> define "required"
[07:16:17] <LightMonk> Hey, I want to run code just once on startup. thought that $(document).ready() would do but it looks like it fires again if i press a button that triggers a .js function. Is there a Method for running Code just once?
[07:17:31] <erichynds> doc.ready only fires once
[07:17:37] <erichynds> as the document is only ready once
[07:18:33] <LightMonk> for me, it doesnt look that way >.<
[07:18:52] <erichynds> does that button you're pressing reload the page?
[07:23:20] <Logitec> is my parseInt not working?
[07:23:22] <Logitec> previousAmount = parseInt(amount + 1);
[07:23:29] <Logitec> amount before = 1
[07:23:37] <Logitec> alerting previousAmount -> 11  instead of  2
[07:23:46] <erichynds> parseInt(amount, 10) + 1
[07:24:01] <khmer_> Logitec: it's doing the addition on two strings, which means concatenation, before the parse
[07:24:31] <Logitec> how can i force javascript to see them as ints?
[07:24:38] <erichynds> parseInt(amount, 10) + 1
[07:24:48] <Logitec> previousAmount = parseInt(amount - 1);  this does return 0
[07:25:15] <Logitec> let me try that
[07:25:19] <kborchers> Logitec: you have been told multiple times ... parseInt individual vars, not the "sum"
[07:25:29] <noaXess> hey all
[07:25:43] <kborchers> "-" works because that won't do concatenation of strings so it assumes ints
[07:25:54] <Logitec> ah, I see!
[07:26:04] <Logitec> yes it works indeed, thank you very much
[07:26:34] <Logitec> i always remembered the mathemetic solutions in class needed extra ( and ), i guess this logica doesnt work in javascript
[07:27:40] <noaXess> i have to datepicker (jquery-ui) fields.. one for start, the second for end... if i change the first fields date the second fields value should be: first files date + 7days :).. there is a minDate option for datepicker.. but for the moment no idea how to compute second field..
[07:32:46] <adolphm> hi
[07:32:55] <adolphm> I have a query ajax, php GET method to return a value, this value I want in a text input, but not how to do it, the value is returned in the php function using echo function.
[07:33:59] <adolphm> I use jquery 1.8.x
[07:34:00] <adolphm> suggestions?
[07:34:52] <futini> help whit this please : http://pastebin.com/whpRML6A
[07:35:01] <futini> is about global var... dont work..
[07:35:03] <adolphm> sorry jquery 1.8
[07:35:48] <kborchers> noaXess: in the onSelect event of datepicker1, you would create a date object, call it newDate, from the dateText provided to that event handler then do newDate.setDate(newDate.getDate()+7) to set it to 7 days from that date, then do set datepicker2's minDate option to that date.
[07:35:51] <kborchers> something like that
[07:37:30] <noaXess> kborchers: i see.. thanks.. :)
[07:49:10] <aitiba> hi
[07:49:10] <cjordan> I've got a quick question for any plug-in developers...
[07:49:27] <aitiba> I'm making a autocompleter with jquery ui
[07:49:43] <aitiba> the data cames from json ok
[07:50:08] <aitiba> but the autocomleter message is so short
[07:50:21] <aitiba> I have ui-autocomplete-input class but the css dont have any selectors for that
[07:51:44] <cjordan> I've got a plug-in that's been in existance for a few years now (CFJS), it essentially gave the user access to many methods that ColdFusion developers would be used to, but that JavaScript did no supply natively. One of these methods (isNumeric()) is now natively available in jQuery...
[07:53:30] <cjordan> I'm trying to think of the best way to detect the version of jQuery that the user has included, and use either *my* isNumeric or the native jQuery one depending on the version of jQuery the user is using.
[07:53:52] <ajpiano> cjordan: it would be better to just see if jQuery.isNumeric exists befoer you override it
[07:54:13] <ajpiano> relying on the actual version number is just an inference - just "feature detect" it
[07:54:41] <Gergov> hi, is there a way if i have a picture 600x800.. to crop it 1:1 - 400x400 when document load ?
[07:54:52] <ajpiano> psuedocode: CFJS.isNumeric = jQuery.isNumeric ? function() { // your impl };
[07:55:07] <ajpiano> lol i mean CFJS.isNumeric = jQuery.isNumeric || function() { // your impl };
[07:55:59] <cjordan> Yeah, I thought of that @ajpiano... but wasn't sure if that syntax would work within the jQuery.extends() method...
[07:57:11] <cjordan> for instance my plug-in really is jQuery.extends({method1 = function(){ //some function},isNumeric = function(arg){// isNumeric logic},method3 = function...
[07:57:13] <cjordan> you see?
[07:57:25] <ajpiano> cjordan: $.extend(someObj, { isNumeric: function(arg) { return jQuery.isNumeric ? jQuery.isNumeric(arg) : (function() { // your impl })();  }   });
[07:57:39] <cjordan> ah...
[07:57:53] <ajpiano> unforch, that way is gonna recreate your function on every call
[07:58:08] <ajpiano> oh but you could like, lazy eval it
[07:58:22] <ajpiano> yeah, you can do something like this
[07:58:25] <cjordan> yeah, I guess that would work. I guess I was thinking about the method just not being there under certain circumstances.
[07:58:59] <ajpiano> $.extend(obj, { isNumeric: (function(){ return jQuery.isNumeric || function() { // your impl }  })();   })
[07:59:04] <ajpiano> and then it'll only create the function once
[07:59:16] <cjordan> right...
[07:59:26] <ajpiano> cjordan: it'll only not-be-there in versions of jquery earlier than 1.7
[07:59:30] <cjordan> yeah, that's probably the way to go...
[07:59:47] <ajpiano> i think that's a lot more robust than doing like "is the jquery version >= 1.7"
[07:59:55] <cjordan> don't know why I couldn't see that before...
[08:00:11] <cjordan> I appreciate the help! :D
[08:00:22] <ajpiano> no prob, always glad to give a lift to a CF dev :)
[08:00:34] <scar2> is there a way to have the accordion automatically switch between the items on a timer or something that never endS?
[08:00:44] <cjordan> CF LIVES! ;o)
[08:00:56] <scar2> like maybe a timer that resets whenever an item is clicked
[08:01:01] <scar2> so it doesnt move for no reason
[08:02:34] <futini> help please :)
[08:02:35] <futini> http://pastebin.com/mRk22L1w
[08:03:02] <futini> why the second function trigger before first
[08:03:52] <quicksilver> futini: because getJSON is asynchronous
[08:04:06] <futini> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[08:05:10] <ezeql> hi, whats the best way for selecting the first child on a div?
[08:05:42] <anvandare> .children().eq(0)
[08:05:46] <futini> and how i can execute first the function whit getjson?
[08:09:34] <DanV> Hi everyone. I'm trying to do something like i'm doing at http://jsfiddle.net/EE8CD/26/ for div1 on click but for any div that is absolutely positioned in a fixed width and height container div. So I could define on hover for it to expand to size X, and it would automatically resize all the divs in the container to make it fit. Any suggestions?
[08:11:54] <kborchers> futini: http://pastebin.com/Dpinunrh
[08:12:34] <Lurzino> hello everyone!
[08:12:39] <Eviltwin> DanV: Maybe look at http://masonry.desandro.com/ ?
[08:13:08] <Lurzino> anyone can suggest me a jquery modal dialox where I can put also checkbox options and get back results of checkboxes?
[08:13:11] <Lurzino> thanks in advance
[08:14:52] <DanV> Eviltwin: yes, I have, but masonry moves the divs around. I want just to resize them, not move their position to the next row.
[08:14:59] <dv310p3r> I've got a page that when a link on it is clicked I run a .load() to get a php doc and place it into a div. That works fine, but what's weird is after I launch the .load() it seems to also be re running the page it was clicked from. It shouldn't all i'm doing is loading the php page into a div on the page it was clicked on. I get a php error for data that was already working in a php foreach loop.
[08:15:07] <DanV> And it acts on a different principle - not on the expansion of elements, but the resizing of the container
[08:17:22] <Eviltwin> DanV: I don't think there's any quick solution for what you're trying to do
[08:17:50] <Eviltwin> Even in your example there
[08:17:57] <Eviltwin> div4's height doesn't grow
[08:18:05] <Eviltwin> Which makes things look weird
[08:18:31] <DanV> Eviltwin:  it does, but not enough. What I was thinking is somehow by position/width/height of each element
[08:18:42] <DanV> to calculate the space it occupies and how it should resize.
[08:19:05] <Eviltwin> Probably want to check out #math :P
[08:19:32] <DanV> But for me, it's not a trivial task :) I don't have enough math-experience to do it right, and i will bang my head against a wall for days on the end.
[08:19:40] <DanV> Eviltwin:  exactly :D
[08:19:51] <DanV> I probably should have checkedout #math more in high school :)
[08:21:29] <Eviltwin> You're probably going to want to establish a graph
[08:21:41] <DanV> what do you mean ?
[08:21:42] <Eviltwin> Each div is a node and each edge represents the neighborness of it
[08:22:47] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)
[08:23:12] <Eviltwin> Not like x vs y
[08:23:24] <DanV> ok
[08:23:26] <DanV> looking now
[08:25:03] <DanV> not understanding much, also now :)
[08:38:44] <niclasDas> hi!
[08:39:23] <appel> Hello. I'm getting this exception: "Uncaught exception: TypeError: Cannot convert 'string' to object"  on "Error thrown at line 622, column 2 in <anonymous function: camelCase>(string) in http://.../jquery-1.7.js:"
[08:39:46] <andrew9183> anyone use ckfinder ?
[08:39:49] <niclasDas> i'm doing an onchange event, so if a date is selected with date picker then changes to another date field with datePicker, but it doesn't works, it appears for a fraction of second the disappear.. anyone know issues about the onchange event?
[08:40:09] <ravenzz> ?demo @ niclasDas
[08:40:09] <bot-t> niclasDas, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:44:42] <rubberneck> I have a graph png file that is updated every minute. It retains the same file name when updated. I am trying to use jquery to automatically update the image unsuccessfully. code: http://jsfiddle.net/5YCdg/1/
[08:45:39] <rubberneck> The graph shows up on page load, but does not ever refresh.
[08:47:31] <rubberneck> If my entire approach is wrong please shove me in the right direction.
[08:48:05] <quicksilver> in many ways, yes.
[08:48:19] <quicksilver> <img src ....> is definitely not Content-type: image/jpeg
[08:48:26] <quicksilver> it's an HTML fragment
[08:48:35] <quicksilver> but there is no need for an HTML fragment at all
[08:48:45] <quicksilver> just change the img.src
[08:48:54] <quicksilver> you'll have to change the name of the file to avoid browser caching
[08:49:02] <quicksilver> bit like you're doing with reload.py
[08:49:43] <quicksilver> $('selector for img').attr('src','csNCOToday.png?randval=' + Math.random());
[08:49:47] <quicksilver> something like that.
[08:49:58] <ravenzz> yep
[08:50:01] <smplstk> use date
[08:50:06] <ravenzz> within the setInterval
[08:50:17] <quicksilver> check your web server will permit (and ignore) ?-params on static files
[08:50:22] <quicksilver> but the ones I've used do.
[08:50:41] <quicksilver> yes, date is better than random
[08:50:50] <smplstk> new Date().getTime();
[08:50:54] <smplstk> always different
[08:51:12] <smplstk> (not that Math.random() will ever repeat, but it might!)
[08:51:34] <rubberneck> So I need to copy the file with a new name and retrun the path to the new file every time?
[08:51:44] <ravenzz> no
[08:51:53] <ravenzz> you must return the file itself
[08:52:18] <ravenzz> (in your pyton script)
[08:53:10] <ravenzz> even thouth it is going to create the new version...
[08:53:19] <ravenzz> otherwise you don't need the .py at all
[08:53:30] <rubberneck> so don't print the string "<img src......" but return the file?
[08:53:49] <ravenzz> just update the img src to /path/to/the/img.png?rand=foo
[08:54:53] <rubberneck> I don't totally understand, but I'm going to try that and see what happens.
[08:56:02] <rubberneck> Isn't that what I have right here: load('./cgi/reload.py?randval='+ Math.random())  ?
[08:57:49] <supsup> whats the . for
[08:58:47] <thdbased> Anyone knows whats wrong with this: http://pastebin.com/sTq3Jf8R
[08:59:11] <thdbased> img(src='/images/bundlemind_radio_fp.png', name='remember_me', onClick='javascript:ToggleImageCheckbox();')
[09:00:13] <thdbased> It's just an image replacement for a checkbox, that needs to be checked and unchecked with respective image versions
[09:00:48] <rubberneck> I think Ill just go with an iframe that refreshes on a timer.
[09:00:52] <rubberneck> Thanks.
[09:02:07] <smplstk> rubberneck: I made one of those recently: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/GWTUJ/
[09:02:09] <smplstk> enjoy!
[09:02:10] <opra> How do i create a json array of the text of the first 50 "p" elements in a page ( i want then to send this json to php)
[09:02:42] <rubberneck> smplstk: Cool, thanks.
[09:02:47] <smplstk> opra: you'd have to each, and build the object
[09:03:22] <quicksilver> rubberneck: you just don't want reload.py at all
[09:03:30] <quicksilver> reload.py was (a) broken and (b) not needd in the first place
[09:03:47] <opra> is each better than a for i loop
[09:04:54] <smplstk> opra: you could do either
[09:05:45] <Brodingo> whats the best way to redirect to a relative path with a hash in js?
[09:07:36] <Brodingo> nm
[09:09:11] <rubberneck> quicksilver: Im still fuzzy, I have never used any ajax whatsoever. so let me try what I think your telling me and Ill let you know. thanks.
[09:10:21] <quicksilver> rubberneck: you don't need ajax here
[09:10:24] <quicksilver> rubberneck: (does that help)
[09:10:30] <quicksilver> all you need to do is change the SRC of that IMG
[09:10:39] <quicksilver> no need for AJAX techniques to update an image.
[09:11:03] <rubberneck> quicksilver: So just refresh the div?
[09:11:07] <quicksilver> no.
[09:11:13] <quicksilver> don't refresh anything
[09:11:16] <quicksilver> don't use ajjax
[09:11:20] <quicksilver> just change the SRC of the IMG
[09:11:41] <quicksilver> $('#imgid').attr('src','/new/path/to/image.png')
[09:11:58] <rubberneck> quicksilver: I guess I dont understand how to do that without refreshing the page or the div?
[09:12:04] <quicksilver> just do it!
[09:12:06] <devc> Can anyone tell me why fadeTo drops my opacity to 0 then fades UP to 0.2 instead of fading down to 0.2 from its current opacity of 1??
[09:12:14] <quicksilver> it's javascript
[09:12:15] <quicksilver> it works
[09:12:25] <quicksilver> if you change the SRC of an IMG in javascript that will change the image.
[09:12:28] <supsup> anyone else notice jsfiddle is being hella slow today?
[09:12:35] <quicksilver> the syntax I pasted above is jQuery syntax
[09:12:39] <quicksilver> although the same will work in plain JS
[09:12:58] <quicksilver> obviously you need to change the selector (it can be ID based it doesn't have to be)
[09:13:04] <quicksilver> and you need the right name for the PNG
[09:13:08] <rubberneck> quicksilver: So I need to change the filename of the image first?
[09:13:15] <quicksilver> well that's the trick
[09:13:21] <quicksilver> because you want the filename to be the same
[09:13:30] <quicksilver> we add '?somerubbish' to the end of the filename
[09:13:46] <quicksilver> because your web server will ignore your ?somerubbish, but your browser will assume it might be a new file and reload it
[09:13:59] <smplstk> opra: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/yg3cf/
[09:14:04] <quicksilver> but I assume you already knew that trick because you wre using it on  reload.py
[09:14:12] <quicksilver> although as we discussed here, current date is slightly neater than random
[09:14:15] <quicksilver> random should work
[09:14:22] <rubberneck> quicksilver: Just some code I got on the web
[09:14:58] <supsup> thdbased:  i think this is what your tryign to do, but i can't tell fully.  since you provided no context.
[09:14:59] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/VFaWA/
[09:15:15] <rubberneck> Alright I understand, let me give it a shot and Ill let you know. Thanks for taking the time.
[09:17:25] <Nomikos> Under what circumstances might a simple $('tr').animate({'height': '120px'}); fail to work?
[09:17:45] <supsup> when ther are no trs on page!
[09:17:50] <supsup> bam i win
[09:17:53] <Nomikos> Assume there are :-p
[09:18:00] <Nomikos> *assuming
[09:18:06] <supsup> when you call that before there are trs on page!
[09:18:14] <supsup> or when you call it before the trs on the page
[09:18:47] <supsup> ? .animate()
[09:18:48] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[09:19:11] <supsup> why not make  a simple use case going over .animate with Trs on jsfiddle.net
[09:19:54] <Nomikos> I might; I can see it works with a simple table, but don't know where to /begin/ to take the one it's supposed to work on apart
[09:20:17] <supsup> the one? the selector your using is all trs
[09:20:27] <thdbased> supsup: It has to work the other way around actually
[09:20:36] <Nomikos> The one table
[09:20:42] <supsup> not sure what you mean thdbased
[09:20:43] <thdbased> the image replaces the checkbox
[09:20:52] <thdbased> the real checkbox is hidden
[09:21:07] <supsup> yah fix up that jsfiddle to do what your trying to do then repost
[09:21:15] <supsup> i don't know what your trying to do based one hwat u sent earlier
[09:21:34] <thdbased> I have a custom styled checkbox
[09:21:50] <thdbased> which uses to images as its state (active and inactive)
[09:21:52] <supsup> yah don't explain it just go make jsfiddle
[09:22:02] <supsup> add comments there
[09:22:06] <supsup> if u want to go into details
[09:22:07] <supsup> in the code
[09:22:29] <thdbased> but it is exactly the same as what you provided
[09:22:42] <thdbased> just the other way around, the image needs to be clicked
[09:22:58] <thdbased> to change the checkboxs state
[09:24:47] <rubberneck> quicksilver: That seems to work.  Thanks for the help. http://jsfiddle.net/5YCdg/2/
[09:25:00] <GoSox> i'm trying to get some code to run when the page loads, but nothing seems to be happening
[09:25:01] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/dkJ92haw
[09:25:05] <quicksilver> rubberneck: yay :)
[09:25:32] <quicksilver> rubberneck: you're now not in any way using jquery of course :P
[09:26:02] <quicksilver> $('#graph').attr('src','/img/csNCOToday.png?' + now.getTime()) is how we'd write tha
[09:26:06] <quicksilver> but, it works, so that's great.
[09:27:48] <rubberneck> quicksilver: yeah, I was definitely trying to make it more complicated that It needed to be.
[09:27:53] <jaequery> i undi understand there is :first-child and last-child,  but how can i get like the 3rd or 4th?
[09:28:06] <opra> Is is possible to do .replacewith on a group of elements?
[09:31:33] <opra> is it faster for jquery to target classes or elements?
[09:32:08] <supsup> thdbased:  http://jsfiddle.net/VFaWA/1/
[09:32:49] <supsup> could just use IDs instead of using .next() etc
[09:32:56] <supsup> prob safer
[09:37:01] <GoSox> wow they're up to firefox 7 already? when did that happen?
[09:38:19] <DanV> GoSox:  when they decided they want to follow instead of lead.
[09:39:58] <quicksilver> GoSox: when they decided that major_version_number++; every 3 months was the way to make their browser better.
[09:40:59] <GoSox> that's messed up
[09:42:01] <quicksilver> it works well for a bit
[09:42:09] <quicksilver> clealrly firefox 6 is 2x as good as firefox 3
[09:42:12] <quicksilver> but it's diminishing returns
[09:42:18] <GoSox> coming soon, firefox 84
[09:42:22] <quicksilver> firefox 21 will only be 5% better than firefox 20
[09:42:41] <quicksilver> it is a bit odd if you ask me
[09:42:49] <quicksilver> basically they're copying chrome
[09:42:56] <quicksilver> I think that's the answer in a nutshell
[09:43:05] <GoSox> i've never actually seen a "version" in chrome, i have no idea what versions i have on any systems
[09:44:00] <GoSox> well anyhoo.... so this code doesn't seem to run, am i doing something wrong?
[09:44:01] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/dkJ92haw
[09:46:24] <devc> I'm trying to use .fadeTo() to fade objects from 1 to 0.2, but instead of doing that, .fadeTo() is first setting opacity to 0 then fades UP to 0.2 -- anyone know why?
[09:47:09] <GoSox> fadefrom?
[09:48:35] <GoSox> damnit
[09:48:51] <GoSox> an hour to realize that there was a "../" missing from my jquery.js include tag
[09:49:05] <dogarrhea> HAHAH
[09:49:28] <ShaunR> i'm using a show() and hide() triggered by a select element changing, how can i make this show().hide() run when the page stops loading too so that whatever the select is set to by default shows properly
[09:51:25] <GoSox> dogarrhea: in my defense, i'm using mod_rewrite, so the dot dot slash level was right in a physical sense, just wrong in the end user virtual sense
[09:51:48] <devc> when I use .animate() the opacity works properly, but when I use .fadeTo() it doesn't work.
[09:57:36] <vladyn> hello guys
[09:58:02] <vladyn> does anyone know why ui-datepicker doesn;t show/hide with option showOn: both ?
[09:58:15] <vladyn> jsut reading the docs
[09:58:39] <opra> how do i send a json array to php
[10:02:07] <vladyn> I simply can;t get it show/hiding
[10:06:22] <ProLoser|Work> if i want to pass a url as a get param, what do i use to uhâ€¦ encode it?
[10:06:31] <ProLoser|Work> do i juse do escape()?
[10:06:54] <ProLoser|Work> like somepage.htm?url=http://www.google.com/howareyou.htm
[10:08:07] <smplstk> ProLoser|Work: technically, there's a bunch of invalid chars in there.
[10:08:36] <sybariten> hello hello
[10:09:16] <sybariten> i dont know a lot of javascript.... to say the least... but i got some help with a friend, to make a menu, that uses jquery to hide and show <div> elements
[10:09:18] <smplstk> ProLoser|Work: encodeURIComponent(str) and encodeURI(str)
[10:09:50] <sybariten> Now, suddenly, it seems as if this simple little structure behaves differently in ff and chrome. Anyone care to take a look at it in your machines? Whats a good place to UL ?
[10:10:15] <sybariten> I seriously cant remember that it was giving me these problems in FF from the beginning, but oh well....     i need it to work in both browsers though
[10:10:41] <smplstk> ProLoser|Work: ?eval encodeURIComponent('http://www.google.com/howareyou.htm');
[10:10:49] <smplstk> bleh
[10:10:56] <smplstk> ?eval encodeURIComponent('http://www.google.com/howareyou.htm');

[10:12:59] <gonssal> hi all
[10:14:08] <gonssal> if you append multiple animate to a selector [i.e. $().animate().animate()...], will they run simultanously or one after the other?
[10:14:24] <gonssal> i know there's a callback function
[10:14:51] <smplstk> gonssal: they'll run at the same time
[10:15:19] <smplstk> actually, the second might overwrite the first if you're animating the same properties
[10:16:10] <gonssal> yep that's what i supposed, but strangely they are running one after the other
[10:16:13] <sean`> uhm
[10:16:18] <sean`> smplstk, gonssal they run consequtive
[10:16:33] <smplstk> oh, really, like one waits for the other?
[10:16:41] <gonssal> apparently yes
[10:16:47] <sean`> http://jsfiddle.net/Jyu72/
[10:16:49] <smplstk> I guess they just queue then
[10:16:55] <sean`> ?tias
[10:16:56] <bot-t> Try It And See
[10:16:57] <sean`> baby
[10:17:17] <smplstk> good to know.
[10:17:40] <smplstk> I love being wrong.
[10:18:07] <smplstk> It only happens, like, everyday.
[10:18:07] <rayj480> hello i search a way to make a horizontal scrolling in my web site
[10:18:21] <rayj480> can u help me please ?
[10:18:38] <sean`> rayj480, <div style="width: 10000px;"></div>
[10:18:41] <sean`> should fix it
[10:20:34] <rayj480> sean` : i don't want to see the horizontal bar
[10:20:35] <MaxMeents> anyone know of an image map editor that can map an area by dragging the mouse along the edge of the hotspot rather than clicking 100s of times to set each individual coord?
[10:23:22] <gonssal> smplstk: the thing is, what's the point of having a callback function
[10:24:19] <Nomikos> why would hide/show work, but slideToggle not work?
[10:24:32] <Nomikos> on <tr> elements
[10:26:30] <luke_66> hi everyone
[10:28:59] <luke_66> i am a newbie w/ jquery. is it possible to change properties of an obeject instantiated in the Document.ready? i have an instance of bxSlider (a picture slider) and i want to set the auto slide transitions to false if the element count is < 5. so i set $(#slider2).attr('auto','false') just before the correspondant div, but nothing happens
[10:30:01] <Nomikos> try with quotes $('#slider2')
[10:30:25] <smplstk> gonssal: the point in having a callback function is so you can do something other than call .animate after it's done
[10:31:40] <luke_66> Nomikos, sorry $('#slider2').attr('auto','false');   . already tried also with $('#slider2').bxSlider.attr('auto','false'); but maybe this creates a new instance...
[10:32:18] <Nomikos> luke_66: gotta url?
[10:32:20] <gonssal> luke_66: .attr is used to change a dom element attribute, not an object property
[10:32:30] <Nomikos> yeah, that too
[10:32:37] <gonssal> how do you start the slider
[10:33:12] <luke_66> gonssal, so what i have to do?
[10:33:26] <gonssal> answer question.
[10:33:57] <smplstk> lol
[10:34:22] <luke_66> gonssal, http://dpaste.com/647363/
[10:34:46] <gonssal> oh dear...
[10:34:57] <gonssal> change auto: true for auto: false
[10:35:01] <gonssal> ?
[10:35:08] <LaytonE> Can anybody explain why this wouldn't be working ? : http://pastie.org/2811015
[10:36:31] <Nomikos> Ok, why would .toggle() work and .slideToggle() /not/ work, on a <tr>
[10:36:48] <luke_66> gonssal, i have to do it after the document.ready, just when i have the number of images that will populate the slider
[10:36:57] <hex``> What is wrong with lines 9-11? The jQuery code only works when I remove function hideElement? http://dpaste.com/647361/
[10:37:02] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, what is not working about it?
[10:37:34] <LaytonE> well,  the other radio boxes with the same name are not checked after I select one
[10:37:44] <tharkun> What piece of documentation should i read to better understand how to send aditional data for the cascade plugin?
[10:37:51] <ignotus> hi, how can I get the positioning (absolute/relative/etc) of an element?
[10:37:55] <LaytonE> I have similar code for select boxes, and input fields, they all work
[10:38:03] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, you cannot check multiple radio boxes with the same name - you need checkboxes for that
[10:38:09] <gonssal> if ($('#slider2 img').length > 5) { ... }
[10:38:13] <Nomikos> ignotus: .position()
[10:38:21] <Nomikos> ehr, ignore that
[10:38:25] <Nomikos> cat on keyboard again
[10:38:32] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, radio boxes are for either/or type of selection, not both
[10:38:47] <ignotus> Nomikos: ah, I mean I want to get a string with "absolute" "relative" etc
[10:38:50] <Nomikos> maybe with .css('position');
[10:38:53] <LaytonE> sadmicrowave, I understand,  I have like 4 sets of yes or no boxes
[10:38:54] <ignotus> Nomikos: I see
[10:39:11] <ignotus> Nomikos: that works, thanks!
[10:39:20] <LaytonE> would like all the yes's checked when sombody checsks yes.  They are seprate "groups"
[10:39:53] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, if they are separate groups then you can't use [name="' + $(this).attr('name') + '"]
[10:40:15] <sadmicrowave> since using that line you are selecting just radio boxes with the same name
[10:40:24] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, perhaps you are looking for the class
[10:40:36] <LaytonE> hmm.  maybe I will have to set their value to a hidden field, and ref them by class
[10:41:28] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, or give all the yes's another tag like answer='yes' and the no's a tag like answer='no'
[10:41:45] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, then reference it in your selector with [answer="' + $(this).attr('answer') + '"]
[10:41:57] <LaytonE> sadmicrowave, I can just add attributes to a tag?
[10:42:01] <LaytonE> that would make life so easy
[10:42:03] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, :) indeed
[10:42:25] <LaytonE> sadmicrowave, THANKS!  Nice.  feel like I just scored
[10:42:28] <LaytonE> haha
[10:42:29] <LaytonE> see ya
[10:42:29] <sadmicrowave> LaytonE, you can make any attribute you want (so long that it is not predefined for use in another context; like 'type' and 'value')
[10:42:33] <Nomikos> There is also .data() which I personally prefer
[10:42:52] <sadmicrowave> Nomikos++
[10:42:58] <LaytonE> sadmicrowave, I thank you for the help.
[10:43:04] <sadmicrowave> indeed have fun
[10:43:48] <smplstk> sad microwave is sad.
[10:44:05] <sadmicrowave> smplstk, is simple
[10:44:39] <michaeln> is the jquery closest()  start from the current element and go up , skipping sibling elements ?
[10:44:50] <hex``> Calling hideElement won't work, so every jQuery code must be a callback of ready function? http://dpaste.com/647369/
[10:44:53] <michaeln> is it intended to skip the sibling elements ?
[10:45:02] <sadmicrowave> michaeln, I think it includes sibling elements
[10:45:16] <erichynds> closest() only goes up the DOM tree
[10:45:20] <smplstk> michaeldeol: Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree.
[10:45:34] <smplstk> UP UP AND AWAY
[10:45:40] <michaeln> my closest skips the siblings,
[10:45:41] <michaeldeol> smplstk: wrong guy
[10:45:43] <michaeldeol> ;)
[10:45:48] <sadmicrowave> erichynds, including preppended siblings
[10:45:52] <erichynds> wat
[10:45:53] <erichynds> no
[10:45:54] <erichynds> up
[10:46:01] <sadmicrowave> just to parents?
[10:46:01] <smplstk> too many michaels
[10:46:05] <erichynds> yes
[10:46:07] <erichynds> ancestors
[10:46:09] <sadmicrowave> ok
[10:46:18] <michaeln> yes, it start with the parent, i wonder if it is intended to work that way
[10:46:21] <hex``> Calling hideElement won't work, so every jQuery code must be a callback of ready function? http://dpaste.com/647369/
[10:46:23] <Nomikos> michaeln: it is
[10:46:25] <sadmicrowave> my mistake michaeln - there is your answer
[10:46:27] <michaeln> before i submit a bug ticket to ask core jquery team
[10:46:30] <erichynds> wat, no
[10:46:35] <erichynds> that is how it works
[10:46:39] <erichynds> as it's documented
[10:46:40] <michaeln> thanks guy
[10:46:51] <smplstk> michaeln that is how it's intended, as documented.
[10:46:51] <Nomikos> It runs up the tree, ignores sibling branches
[10:46:52] <sadmicrowave> erichynds, you're documented
[10:46:56] <erichynds> NO U
[10:46:57] <sadmicrowave> ;p
[10:47:13] <smplstk> what I pasted was from the documention - yay
[10:47:14] <sadmicrowave> FACE
[10:47:22] <Nomikos> michaeln: it's sorta like parent() only faster (and no doubt there are other differences)
[10:47:23] <erichynds> +1 internets to smplstk
[10:47:30] <sadmicrowave> hah
[10:47:36] <smplstk> cept I gave it to the wrong michael
[10:47:41] <erichynds> :||
[10:47:47] <smplstk> -1 for autocomplete
[10:48:16] <smplstk> I guess it's easier to ask in here than it to read the documentation :|
[10:48:28] <smplstk> +is
[10:48:38] <sadmicrowave> smplstk, that is often the case - unfortunately
[10:49:05] <Nomikos> Well, it /is/ :-p and sometimes you've browsed the docs for so long your eyes get blurry
[10:49:06] <smplstk> sadmicrowave: OH INORITE
[10:49:19] <anvandare> any open source tools to minify javascript?
[10:49:34] <smplstk> anvandare: a bunch
[10:49:43] <erichynds> all of them?
[10:49:54] <erichynds> rite
[10:49:56] <smplstk> there are like, a lot.
[10:49:58] <erichynds> is closure open source?

[10:51:24] <tharkun> on the cascade plugin this data: { myotherdata: jQuery("#ajax_header").html() } renders  "Simple Ajax (in ext)" which is well understood. How do i pass a constant from the form to the server like A = "Aditional data" ?
[10:51:27] <smplstk> http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/ @ anvandare
[10:51:43] <anvandare> thanks
[10:51:56] <blognewb> hi everyone, is this $("p .h3") the same as writing without the dot in h3?
[10:52:12] <Nomikos> no, the dot would make it refer to a class
[10:52:16] <sadmicrowave> blognewb, you have a class called h3?
[10:52:22] <Nomikos> <p><foo class='h3'>
[10:52:37] <smplstk> <h3 class='h3'></h3>
[10:52:38] <blognewb> sadmicrowave oh ok because i was watching a youtube tutorial and he referred to .h3 as the h3 tag
[10:52:42] <smplstk> lolerskates
[10:52:53] <blognewb> ggot a little confused
[10:52:59] <sadmicrowave> $('p h3') = <p><h3>poop</h3></p>
[10:53:06] <eddiemonge> blognewb: dont believe everything you see on youtube
[10:53:12] <sadmicrowave> lol
[10:53:29] <eddiemonge> a little invalid markup to start your day off
[10:53:33] <eddiemonge> ^^
[10:53:37] <blognewb> how about "p.h3" same as "p .h3"?
[10:53:42] <sadmicrowave> blognewb, the jquery website is much better for understanding jquery than youtube
[10:53:42] <smplstk> if everything that happens on TV is real, and everything that happens on the internet is real, than youtube is double real.
[10:53:46] <smplstk> I heard you like real.
[10:54:04] <Nomikos> blognewb: no, without the space it means <p class='h3'>, not a child element
[10:54:16] <sadmicrowave> Nomikos++
[10:54:17] <blognewb> oh cool
[10:54:18] <blognewb> thanks
[10:54:19] <Nomikos> blognewb: it's pretty similar to regular CSS in that regards
[10:54:33] <blognewb> i see so it follows css syntax too
[10:54:46] <sadmicrowave> thats by design also

[10:55:06] <Nomikos> Hmm.. I should read that sometime
[10:55:10] <sarkis> hey guys, so i am running a .click() on a button that ends up submitting some form, however, it seems to be clicking it twice?
[10:55:33] <Nomikos> sarkis: is it a submit button per any chance?
[10:55:43] <michelem> hello folks
[10:55:45] <sarkis> when i do it from the firebug console, works fine clicks it once.. as soon as i put it in my script and run it from there its doing it twice
[10:56:01] <sarkis> Nomikos: its an input that acts as the submit for the form
[10:56:01] <eddiemonge> sarkis: is your code getting called twice?
[10:56:13] <eddiemonge> ?preventdefault @ sarkis
[10:56:14] <bot-t> sarkis, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[10:56:17] <sarkis> eddiemonge: im trying to figure it out.. it looks like the code for the click is run twice
[10:56:20] <sybariten> object orientation can bite my shiny metal ass
[10:56:20] <sarkis> oh ya!
[10:56:23] <sarkis> i forget about that
[10:57:52] <sarkis> eddiemonge: this is kind of weird though i want it to do a click on the button and run what happens next?
[10:58:07] <sarkis> if i use preventDefault, it won't act like a click?
[10:58:26] <sarkis> problem is it's doing what happens next twice
[10:58:37] <sadmicrowave> sarkis, prenvetDefault prevents the submit default action from firing; it does not prevent the click action from firing
[10:58:50] <sarkis> i see
[10:59:24] <sadmicrowave> sarkis, you want it to click, but you don't want it to automatically submit.  So you prevent the automatic [default] action and continue with your function
[11:00:13] <Nomikos> Be nice if there was a "doThisFirst" handler
[11:00:14] <michelem> I want a "rolling counter" similar to http://zysoft.github.com/jrollingcounter/ , but I do want it to run forever, not to stop. That will do something similar to gmail's quota counter. Any tip?
[11:00:41] <eddiemonge> Nomikos: the first one bound to an event gets that distinction
[11:00:56] <Nomikos> "doThisFirster"
[11:01:26] <Nomikos> Maybe if you call it with all-caps, it'll move it to the front
[11:01:53] <especially-corn> hello, i'm trying to apply a css to just one jquery ui dialog
[11:01:56] <especially-corn> not to all, is it possible?
[11:02:03] <sadmicrowave> michelem, why would you not specify a stop number?
[11:02:17] <sarkis> sadmicrowave: hmm actually i want it to click and auto submit :/, just tried the preventDefault and it stopped everything in its tracks
[11:02:21] <michelem> sadmicrowave: why would I?
[11:02:35] <sadmicrowave> michelem, yes, why would you?
[11:02:35] <kollapse> Hi. Anyone here using jquery.datatables ?
[11:02:45] <michelem> indeed :)
[11:03:17] <sadmicrowave> michelem, I'm asking why you would not use a stopDigit (the default is 0, but you could make this anything you wanted)
[11:03:29] <michelem> sadmicrowave: I don't know how it matters, however it will count "how much spam we have filtered so far". It's always increasing.
[11:03:57] <sadmicrowave> sarkis, if you want to click and auto-submit you shouldn't be complaining about the function firing twice, since that is what you are telling it to do
[11:04:34] <michelem> if you will, I am asking: Do you know gmail's "Over 7644.061918 megabytes (and counting) of free storage." counter? Is there anything similar in jquery, but "rolling" ?
[11:04:35] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: its possible
[11:04:36] <sarkis> hmm so maybe i want .submit()
[11:04:41] <sarkis> instead of .click()
[11:04:48] <eddiemonge> michelem: thats more backend
[11:04:50] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, i thought it should be but how can i achieve that?
[11:04:58] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: give the dialog an id
[11:05:05] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, it does have an id
[11:05:07] <michelem> eddiemonge: uh?
[11:05:13] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: then target that with the id
[11:05:33] <sadmicrowave> sarkis, indeed
[11:05:34] <eddiemonge> michelem: im assuming that statistic is generated by your backend system, not your frontend system
[11:05:39] <michelem> it's real simple. I load the page with a <span id="count">12345</span> value. Then a js (jquery) updates that counter.
[11:05:39] <especially-corn> i tried .ui-widget#vertical, div#vertical .ui-widget
[11:05:43] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, nothing worked
[11:05:56] <michelem> question: any rolling counter that does not stop?
[11:06:31] <Nomikos> especially-corn: specify *just* the id, since it's unique that should be enough and always work
[11:07:08] <eddiemonge> michelem: so you just want something to autoincrement on the front end? even if its not a real statistic?
[11:07:19] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: are you familiar with css?
[11:07:24] <especially-corn> Nomikos, but i can't since the widget has multiple values .ui-widget, .ui-widget-content, .ui-widget-header the list goes on and on
[11:07:29] <michelem> eddiemonge: precisely.
[11:07:33] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: what specifically on it are you trying to change?
[11:07:48] <eddiemonge> michelem: so you want the fake counter to count up?
[11:07:52] <michelem> that's exactly what google does, and it's the most reasonable way to do it.
[11:07:58] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, i want the normal accordions to be unstyled and the vertical accordion to be styled
[11:08:13] <eddiemonge> michelem: googles doesnt change every second. its per page load i think
[11:08:26] <b1lly> if i create a object = new Object();           and fill it up with data... how do i empty it? just invoke a new object = new Object(); ?
[11:08:30] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: normal accordions?
[11:08:44] <eddiemonge> b1lly: object = null
[11:09:07] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, i have 3, they were all unstyled up to now but now i want to style one of them, i can't style all of them because they ruin my page layout if i do
[11:09:08] <michelem> it does change every second. But it's irrelevant: do you have any jquery tip? Elsewhere I'm writing it in plain js
[11:09:13] <b1lly> eddiemonge: if i do object = new Object();  will that overwrite it with an empty object?
[11:09:15] <sadmicrowave> b1lly, object = {}
[11:09:31] <sadmicrowave> yes
[11:10:17] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, because of the styling one of the accordions takes up too much space in a limited div which does not look nice at all
[11:10:24] <eddiemonge> michelem: function fakeCounter() { $('#count').text( parseInt($('#count').text(), 10) + 1); setTimeout(fakeCounter, 1000); } fakeCounter()
[11:10:52] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: just target them with the id
[11:11:20] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, i would love to but i don't know how to specify all elements by id  .ui-widget, .ui-widget-content, .ui-widget-header....
[11:11:44] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, those are set by the default jquery-ui
[11:12:08] <eddiemonge> #id .class1, #id .class2.  its css 101
[11:12:17] <sadmicrowave> especially-corn, can you not add your own ID when you create the element?
[11:12:43] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, eddiemonge that doesn't work
[11:12:59] <sadmicrowave> ?demo @ especially-corn
[11:12:59] <bot-t> especially-corn, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:13:42] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: are your rules loaded after the jqueryui ones?
[11:13:58] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, wait, i'll jsfiddle it
[11:14:00] <eddiemonge> michelem: does that work?
[11:14:54] <michelem> eddiemonge: thanks. That works but it's not "rolling". For a simple update I'd probably use plain hs
[11:15:35] <eddiemonge> what do you mean its not rolling? you mean you want an animated effected?
[11:16:01] <jedimind> we be rollin'
[11:16:10] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, eddiemonge i can't jsfiddle it since the jsquery javascripts have a huge footprint
[11:16:14] <especially-corn> the browser freeses
[11:16:51] <sadmicrowave> especially-corn, just put what you are looking at in pastebin or something, I'm having a hard time visualizing what you are trying to do
[11:16:59] <eddiemonge> select jquery on the left dropdown, then add the jqui resources there as well
[11:17:02] <evilgeenius> Is anyone farmiliar with a DMCA takedown?
[11:17:18] <eddiemonge> evilgeenius: yeah its take it down or get sued into oblivion
[11:17:20] <detailiffanu> hi
[11:17:28] <eddiemonge> or do you want to know how to do request one?
[11:17:36] <detailiffanu> how can i check if element will overflow another element in case i append it to it?
[11:17:43] <detailiffanu> without actually appending
[11:17:47] <evilgeenius> eddiemonge: A client has literally cloned the website I created for them.
[11:17:53] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, well without the jquery items you won't be able to tell
[11:17:58] <evilgeenius> eddiemonge: using wget or some other tool
[11:18:33] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, http://95.76.74.76
[11:18:50] <eddiemonge> evilgeenius: thats what your contract is for
[11:18:58] <eddiemonge> sue them!
[11:19:03] <evilgeenius> eddiemonge: there was no contract
[11:19:08] <anvandare> lol
[11:19:10] <evilgeenius> yes, i know.
[11:19:23] <evilgeenius> But they still have no right to copy my site
[11:19:37] <evilgeenius> Their stylesheets even include the comments specific to my machine
[11:19:45] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, does it work
[11:19:46] <especially-corn> ?
[11:19:47] <sadmicrowave> especially-corn, alright, walk me through what you are trying to do, be as descriptive as possible
[11:19:49] <eddiemonge> without a contract you are going to be hard pressed to have them take it down, especially if the content is related to them
[11:20:06] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, mind if i private you?
[11:20:10] <detailiffanu> um, hi
[11:20:12] <`ini> i'm getting a   funtion   is not a function error. the script loads (I can view it from firebug), and i tried noConflict(), but no luck. any ideas out there?
[11:20:26] <detailiffanu> is it possible to check if element A will overflow element B if it will be appended?
[11:20:43] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, so we don't clog up this channel
[11:20:46] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: dont do @import in the css
[11:20:54] <Nomikos> `ini: is the function defined inside jquery "$(function() {" but called outside of it?
[11:21:00] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, that's what the jquery css did
[11:21:28] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: really? are you sure?
[11:21:40] <especially-corn> eddiemonge, yep, download the jquery-ui and see for yourself
[11:21:49] <`ini> Nomikos - that looks like the snytax from the file. its SimpleModal, if that helps
[11:22:11] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, as you can see the hidden accordion on the left is not displaying properly
[11:22:20] <especially-corn> that's fine since i dont want it to
[11:22:33] <especially-corn> but that's the vertical one, it should display properly
[11:23:05] <Nomikos> `ini: yes, but what function is it complaining about, one you've added?
[11:23:24] <eddiemonge> especially-corn: ok i did and thats not how they are doing it
[11:23:24] <Nomikos> `ini: or maybe it requires jqueryui to be loaded?
[11:23:25] <sadmicrowave> especially-corn, I use jquery-ui all the time and never have had a problem with styling. humor me by taking out the @import's and include the path to your css's in your <head>
[11:23:25] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, eddiemonge i just realized i changed the vertical from a class to a id
[11:23:59] <`ini> Nomikos - ill go recheck the documentation
[11:24:07] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, eddiemonge so it should be .vertical .ui-dialog, it works now
[11:24:12] <especially-corn> sadmicrowave, eddiemonge thanks guys
[11:24:16] <sadmicrowave> ok
[11:25:16] <detailiffanu> hi
[11:25:31] <detailiffanu> how can i check if element A will overflow element B if i will append it?
[11:25:44] <Nomikos> `ini: I'm backgrounding a bit, might not see any mentions immediately
[11:26:30] <eddiemonge> detailiffanu: what do you mean? visually?
[11:26:39] <detailiffanu> yes
[11:26:46] <detailiffanu> will it fit into B or not
[11:26:57] <detailiffanu> assuming B contains other elements
[11:27:03] <eddiemonge> check the heights
[11:27:12] <detailiffanu> eddiemonge: A can have variable height
[11:27:14] <detailiffanu> and B too
[11:27:17] <eddiemonge> does B have a fixed height?
[11:27:21] <detailiffanu> and B can have other elements with variable heights
[11:27:23] <eddiemonge> then it will make it expand
[11:27:26] <detailiffanu> eddiemonge: no, B resizes with window
[11:27:40] <detailiffanu> eddiemonge: it must not be expanded
[11:27:46] <detailiffanu> i am implementing dynamic content fetching
[11:27:55] <detailiffanu> 'fetch enough to fill container'
[11:27:56] <eddiemonge> why cant it scroll?
[11:28:02] <detailiffanu> because it isn't fancy
[11:28:31] <detailiffanu> eddiemonge: http://www.trolls.lv/
[11:28:36] <detailiffanu> i will fetch posts into center div
[11:28:44] <detailiffanu> you can see entire design is scaleable
[11:28:54] <detailiffanu> i need to fetch just enough posts to fill center container
[11:29:01] <detailiffanu> and on resize i will fetch some more / delete some
[11:29:51] <eddiemonge> i refuse to help any site that says joomla more than 0 times!
[11:30:00] <detailiffanu> eddiemonge: its not in joomla
[11:30:07] <detailiffanu> i just copied random text there
[11:30:11] <eddiemonge> i know but it says joomla lol
[11:30:25] <detailiffanu> okay will you help me if i censor word Joomla there?
[11:31:04] <eddiemonge> not since im not sure i can
[11:31:25] <eddiemonge> meant no, since im not sure i can
[11:31:25] <detailiffanu> :/
[11:32:19] <eddiemonge> the only solution i can think of is super dirty. get the height of all the immediate children of that box, add them up, subtract them from the parents height, then see if this is more or less than the height of the new content
[11:32:38] <detailiffanu> eddiemonge: how about width?
[11:32:43] <detailiffanu> posts won't occupy 100% width
[11:32:48] <detailiffanu> they will be probably with float:left
[11:33:12] <detailiffanu> otherwise on wide resolutions it won't look nice
[11:33:24] <eddiemonge> same thing i guess although if you are using float it makes it hard since they can wrap
[11:33:36] <detailiffanu> yep
[11:34:02] <detailiffanu> and i wish i could make them of fixed height, but i can't, because every post length is different
[11:34:17] <eddiemonge> ?wrapinner
[11:34:18] <bot-t> .wrapInner(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
[11:34:30] <detailiffanu> um?
[11:36:45] <sraka1> hi
[11:36:48] <`ini> Nomikos - loaded up ui, but i still get the error
[11:36:56] <sraka1> can anyone help me with this -> http://pastie.org/private/ytdlbruag9wgpybixheg
[11:37:11] <sraka1> .click won't recognize the click
[11:39:23] <Nomikos> `ini: is it something you can reproduce in jsfiddle so's we can look at it?
[11:40:22] <ravenzz> sraka1
[11:40:33] <ravenzz> it is silly to look into the data
[11:40:45] <ravenzz> as you are getting back JSON
[11:40:58] <ravenzz> you can get the title/year directly
[11:41:19] <`ini> http://www2.wou.edu/pls/wou2/woutv.home2
[11:42:01] <`ini> the  next page  button for Most Popular is where it is being called
[11:42:31] <sraka1> ravenzz you mean like $("title").val(data.Title)
[11:42:38] <sraka1> no wait
[11:43:16] <eddiemonge> `ini: where modal defined?
[11:43:35] <eddiemonge> and why are you using jquery 1.5.0?
[11:44:26] <`ini> i don't know why they picked that version
[11:44:36] <eddiemonge> well upgrade that.
[11:44:37] <`ini> can you turn on line numbering in firebug?
[11:44:42] <eddiemonge> 1.5.0 has a known bug
[11:45:07] <`ini> ok, ill go fix that
[11:47:32] <`ini> eddiemonge - upgraded, but the error persists
[11:49:02] <eddiemonge> `ini: something is hijacking $
[11:49:06] <`ini> yeh
[11:49:22] <`ini> i could try  delegate again, couldn't get it to work yesterday
[11:49:37] <eddiemonge> thats not going to prevent $ from being hijacked
[11:49:38] <`ini> ill try the noConflict again
[11:49:43] <`ini> no
[11:49:49] <`ini> but, if delegate works, i dont need .modal
[11:49:52] <eddiemonge> somewhere in your code there is a $ = .... or a window.$ = ...
[11:50:11] <`ini> hm.. ok, ill go look for that
[11:51:10] <ravenzz> sraka1 yes http://jsfiddle.net/vnvgF/
[11:52:23] <`ini> my search for those came up empty
[11:52:26] <sraka1> ravenzz: thanks
[11:52:36] <eddiemonge> `ini: its jquery.tools hijacking it
[11:52:53] <ravenzz> yw
[11:53:01] <`ini> how can you tell?
[11:53:05] <sraka1> btw, how would I call somekind of loading image while it's requesting the json with ajax?
[11:53:11] <eddiemonge> because im looking at the ccode
[11:53:28] <cambrian> What do you think the best resource is for learning jQuery? Any recommended books?
[11:53:36] <eddiemonge> `ini: in the very first line of the code
[11:53:57] <eddiemonge> `ini: its including its own version of jquery: 1.3.2
[11:54:15] <ASUChander> If I have one window that opens another, and then use a statement like $('a',window.opener.document).click() - is there a way to get event handlers to trigger?
[11:54:18] <ravenzz> sraka1 you can define a css loading class and add it within the submit handler, and then remove it on success
[11:54:49] <`ini> ok, i don't have access to that directory, i'll reroute it
[11:55:07] <`ini> is .tools  part of the jquery release?
[11:55:59] <`ini> guess not, found it
[11:56:29] <eddiemonge> `ini: no. its supposed to be a competitor to jquery ui
[11:58:06] <ravenzz> sraka1 http://jsfiddle.net/vnvgF/2/
[11:59:06] <`ini> haha. well, linking to the newest version, but same error
[11:59:14] <sraka1> thanks ravenzz, it's actually so simple :)
[11:59:20] <ravenzz> it is ;)
[11:59:34] <eddiemonge> `ini: are you using tools for anything? if not, remove it
[12:00:01] <Nomikos> Huh. How would simply restarting the browser fix a javascript issue >.<
[12:00:18] <Nomikos> In a perfect world that couldn't make any difference, could it?
[12:00:22] <ravenzz> sraka1 anyway you should handle errors there
[12:00:41] <ravenzz> just to be sure that everything is ok
[12:02:52] <`ini> oy vey. removing enables the function, but the tools is needed for the page
[12:03:10] <thomedy> okay i have a php variable  populated by adatabase query that holdes a  unix timestamp... i want to compare it to a time the most recent time stamp i have in my database the only way i can do this is with ajax right because php is server and js is client... so even though the page is already populated with the variables content the js needs an ajax to grab that or am i wrong
[12:03:56] <thomedy> in particular this time stamp is not in the html or i would just use inner html but its a variable holding the contnet
[12:04:01] <Nomikos> If both values you want to compare are already on the page, you don't need ajax
[12:04:17] <Nomikos> a javascript variable?
[12:04:36] <thomedy> Nomikos... i wan't thinking straight when i typed that first bit with the addition of the php variable not printed in the html is that still true
[12:05:10] <Nomikos> thomedy: the php variable is printed in a javascript variable, but has to be compared to the max(timestamp) from the database on the server?
[12:05:25] <thomedy> okay im sorry let me try again..
[12:05:31] <dv310p3r> Anyone ever have a problem getting the post data from a TinyMCE textarea. The editor works fine, but I can't get the post data. It's just empty.
[12:05:32] <thomedy> i have a facebook feed i have craeted
[12:05:43] <thomedy> and im wanting to update it based on time obviously
[12:05:47] <thomedy> so whats currently on the page
[12:05:59] <thomedy> my current display is perfect and now im adding the update function
[12:06:12] <Nomikos> right
[12:06:19] <thomedy> so i have a variable in my php page that holds the timestamp
[12:06:28] <thomedy> however it does not print it because i dont' wna tit in there
[12:06:39] <thomedy> but i need to be able to update based on it..
[12:06:58] <Jon47> thomedy <input type="hidden">?
[12:07:01] <thomedy> so i waht i want is to add a jquery slide with each new update...easy enogu
[12:07:01] <Nomikos> you can put it inside some js code
[12:07:31] <Nomikos> or as a data-* attribute value, this is the easy part I think
[12:07:38] <thomedy> okay  i am new... so i guess ill have to google all that your suggestion implies jon47
[12:07:40] <thomedy> and thank you
[12:07:57] <ravenzz> thomedy are you using the facebook apis?
[12:08:00] <Jon47> actually the data- attribute is a beter suggetsion
[12:08:01] <Nomikos> thomedy: do you have a url we could look at?
[12:08:08] <thomedy> yeah heres the url...
[12:08:12] <thomedy> www.thomedy.com/lifecenter
[12:08:42] <thomedy> i just started doing this half a year ago... so im still learning
[12:08:47] <thomedy> maybe a little over now but about that
[12:09:11] <thomedy> this is my first solid database work
[12:09:16] <thomedy> i was toying with it earlier
[12:09:23] <thomedy> but now its in motion
[12:10:06] <Nomikos> are you familiar with ajax?
[12:10:12] <thomedy> yeah i can ajax
[12:10:20] <Nomikos> I didn't get that it was to be an auto-update thing earlier
[12:10:38] <thomedy> wait your saying that you do know now or you dont' know how..?
[12:10:47] <thomedy> just because i want to make sure we communicate effectively
[12:10:55] <ravenzz> do you store your streaming on the db?
[12:11:02] <ravenzz> stream*
[12:11:24] <thomedy> yeah i think so... context.. i use drupal...
[12:11:34] <ravenzz> do you really need that?
[12:11:39] <thomedy> so the database is filled off of an fbrss.com
[12:11:59] <thomedy> i think i do right now cuz like i said im still learning... and then after that
[12:12:03] <thomedy> drupal pays well.
[12:12:04] <thomedy> really well
[12:12:09] <thomedy> im surprised honestly
[12:12:15] <ravenzz> i wouldnt allow them to read from my fb stream :p
[12:12:20] <thomedy> but im learnign really really really qucik i think
[12:12:44] <thomedy> any way.. i spent a long tim googling how to get my fb rss feed for my friend
[12:12:49] <johnywp> hey guys
[12:12:51] <thomedy> and fbrss.com is the only way
[12:12:54] <ravenzz> at the same time I haven't played with fb apis before, https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/stream.get/
[12:12:56] <eddiemonge> michelem: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/C4mR7/1/
[12:13:05] <thomedy> so thats how i get the feed and it goes to the database  and thats where i pull it out of
[12:13:13] <ravenzz> thomedy ^
[12:13:16] <johnywp> ravenzz! I missed you yesterday - internet cut out
[12:13:22] <johnywp> thank you again for all your help
[12:13:48] <ravenzz> oh well I can't remember how I helped you...but you are welcome :P
[12:13:50] <thomedy> i think the api thing is taken care of as you can see the content is there... i get it out of the databasse... i jus tneed to get my php variable in to my jquery page.. and i know its server/client issues
[12:13:59] <michelem> eddiemonge: that's cool, thanks!
[12:14:20] <michelem> any chance to have only the "changing digits" roll?
[12:14:31] <thomedy> wait you know what i just realized i absulutely need ninput hidden
[12:14:47] <thomedy> bi was just thinking about th elogic because i cant test the database to the database
[12:14:49] <thomedy> thats stupid
[12:14:49] <Nomikos> <script type='text/javascript'> var foobar = '<?php echo $myvariable; ?>'; </script> like that?
[12:15:05] <thomedy> are you kidding thats cake
[12:15:07] <thomedy> i love that
[12:15:16] <thomedy> thats way easier than the other way around
[12:15:31] <thomedy> so all i have to do is php echo a var into a js var
[12:15:36] <thomedy> awesom
[12:15:39] <johnywp> here it ishttp://jsfiddle.net/754hN/1/
[12:15:44] <eddiemonge> michelem: thats a little bit harder since all the digits could roll
[12:15:44] <thomedy> merci
[12:15:46] <Nomikos> ehr, yes, that's one way to go about it
[12:15:54] <johnywp> we were trying to get the fb button to be clickable within the dialog box
[12:16:10] <eddiemonge> Nomikos: you could drop the type="text.... part
[12:16:29] <ravenzz> Oh yes! does it work  now?
[12:16:33] <johnywp> nope :P
[12:16:36] <ravenzz> lol
[12:16:43] <johnywp> it renders (because of you), but it's not clickable
[12:16:59] <Nomikos> eddiemonge: probably... I'm old-skool. I just had to un-learn <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
[12:17:12] <michelem> eddiemonge: still, you could instantiate that class N times for N digits, and then control whose one to call "rollMe()" based on simple modulos
[12:17:15] <ravenzz> also it was still today for me :P as it was morning here
[12:17:42] <johnywp> oh lol
[12:17:43] <ravenzz> I have to go to prepair the dinner :S
[12:17:44] <johnywp> europe?
[12:17:47] <ravenzz> yes
[12:17:51] <johnywp> where?
[12:17:54] <ravenzz> italy
[12:18:03] <johnywp> grazzi
[12:18:12] <eddiemonge> michelem: yeah but you also have to use fixed positioning changes as well and have each digit get wrapped in its own div. you  know, fun stuff
[12:18:36] <ravenzz> ahahha "grazie"
[12:18:47] <johnywp> :P
[12:19:02] <johnywp> i would have more words for you if you said spain
[12:19:13] <ravenzz> I'll quit, see you
[12:19:15] <johnywp> wish i had chosen to learn italian instead though
[12:19:23] <johnywp> ok ty again!
[12:19:42] <Nomikos> I've seen Italian and Spanish people just talk to eachother in their own language, it seemed to work
[12:19:57] <johnywp> can anybody think of a way to make the fb button clickable within the dialog box here? http://jsfiddle.net/754hN/1/
[12:20:24] <johnywp> Nomikos: they are very similar... gamates gloses kai oi dio ;)
[12:20:37] <johnywp> but greek is the best
[12:20:48] <Nomikos> Ehr.. yeah, actually I'm Dutch myself :-p
[12:20:56] <Nomikos> Sorry to disappoint :)
[12:21:03] <johnywp> ehm.. i never saw that coming
[12:21:11] <Nomikos> Are you Greek?
[12:21:15] <johnywp> how come the greek name?
[12:21:27] <Nomikos> Old sci-fi hero
[12:21:29] <johnywp> yes - not in greece at the moment, but originally from there
[12:23:15] <b1lly> is there a way to print an object
[12:23:16] <thomedy> okay you said input hidden... i was reading about that and i found that 'input' part even when hidden is just for posting data or as it said deliver of form data
[12:23:19] <b1lly> so that i can see its structure
[12:23:39] <thomedy> but since that really doens't matter to me.. i can just use anytag correct and display hidden
[12:23:39] <thomedy> and then innerhtml it still
[12:23:49] <Nomikos> b1lly: object.toSource(), but not in all browsers (only Firefox?)
[12:24:17] <NickASloan> I am doing a trigger that gets handled by one event, which triggers another event which is handled and so on
[12:24:55] <NickASloan> but I have some code right after the first trigger() that needs to run after all of the event handlers in the chain started by trigger have done their thing.
[12:26:14] <eddiemonge> console.log( object )
[12:26:18] <eddiemonge> b1lly: ^^
[12:26:49] <Nomikos> probably better
[12:27:23] <johnywp> any ideas for this guys? http://jsfiddle.net/754hN/1/
[12:30:03] <eddiemonge> for what?
[12:30:59] <johnywp> eddiemonge: we managed to get the fb login button to render within the dialog box that opens when you click on hello, however, it's not clickable
[12:31:14] <NickASloan> here's a demonstration of my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/kFrEz/ the next line executes before the handler does. How do I fix that?
[12:32:31] <NickASloan> I lied, my example is broken
[12:34:05] <eddiemonge> johnywp: because you are only copying the html, not the actual button or its associated events
[12:35:42] <johnywp> is there any way to copy all the associated events?
[12:36:18] <khmer_> anyone used jquery with requirejs?
[12:36:19] <eddiemonge> ?clone @ johnywp
[12:36:20] <bot-t> johnywp, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[12:36:26] <khmer_> why do they insist on combining them into the same file?
[12:40:38] <johnywp> hmmm
[12:40:42] <johnywp> thank you for the suggestion
[12:41:09] <johnywp> I tried $('.fb-login-button').clone().appendTo('.face'); where .face is a div within my dialog box, but it still doesn't seem to work
[12:41:23] <johnywp> the button renders but it's still not clickable
[12:41:31] <johnywp> am I doing it wrong?
[12:41:44] <johnernaut> Is there any way to add something to an attribute string on click?  Like if I have an href="blah" how can I append data on click so it looks like href="blah?foo" ?
[12:42:38] <eddiemonge> johnernaut: read the docs for clone. you need to clone events as well
[12:43:05] <johnernaut> :o
[12:43:14] <johnernaut> sounds? tedious
[12:43:29] <johnywp> oh - is there a way to tell it to clone all the events? or do i have to specify each of them? i am asking because the fb.js file is quite large and I am not sure which events need to be copied
[12:46:44] <eddiemonge> ?clone @ johnywp
[12:46:45] <bot-t> johnywp, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[12:48:30] <johnywp> thank you eddiemonge. it's just that I don't know which events should be cloned... there is no way to include them all in order to make sure?
[12:48:43] <jaequery> can i do like this for css selector,    " li:contains(Hi):first-child " ?
[12:51:48] <eddiemonge> johnywp: .clone(true, true)
[13:01:59] <sarkis> wow this makes no sense.. no matter what i do this ajax call somehow is calling to the url more than once..
[13:02:10] <johnywp> eddiemonge: thank you for that. it still doesn't seem to work though - still copying all the data (ie. the button renders), but it's not clickable
[13:06:36] <Cade> I have a mouseover handler on an element. How do I keep it from firing when I move onto an element that is INSIDE the element the handler is on?
[13:07:35] <erichynds> Cade: use mouseenter
[13:10:07] <Cade> and mouseleave?
[13:12:26] <erichynds> yessir
[13:15:54] <sarkis> hey guys i have a form framework and i need one of the forms to not prompt the user for anything and just submit itself.. so when i run that.submit() instead of clicking, somehow it runs multiple times... its like i clicked multiple times
[13:16:05] <sarkis> if i leave it the way it is and click through, it runs once..
[13:16:35] <sarkis> what could be causing it to fire submit() or even click() more than once from within the script
[13:17:26] <detailiffanu> hi
[13:17:38] <detailiffanu> how can i check if element with overflow:auto has any scrollbars visible?
[13:18:52] <Brodingo> ?vc
[13:18:52] <bot-t> very carefully
[13:19:21] <erichynds> check if the scrollHeight property > the height of the element
[13:19:38] <thomedy> can i grabb the info out of an rss feed with jquery or am i going back to php for this part
[13:19:47] <erichynds> except that I don't think that works in IE <= 7
[13:19:51] <MaxMeents> anyone know how to add a css effect to a mapped area?
[13:20:03] <thomedy> somehow i have to know when an rss feed gets to me
[13:20:47] <detailiffanu> erichynds: well i need cross-browser solution
[13:24:54] <kollapse> How do I use two event function handlers when using .on() ? For example , the hover event has two handlers. Can I use .on("hover", function(){...}, function(){...}); because it seems I can't. Any solutions for this ?
[13:25:06] <kerx> hi all, I'm using the datatables plugin in jquery.  I initialize a datable and I'm trying to reDraw the datatable with new data to filter a specific column.  Could anyone please help?
[13:25:40] <gnarf> kollapse: .hover( on , off ) is a shorcut function
[13:25:57] <kollapse> gnarf: Oh, so the shortcuts use event delegation by default ?
[13:25:58] <gnarf> kollapse: for .on( "mouseenter", fn ).on( "mouseleave", fn )
[13:36:32] <dandrinkard> anybody know how to get the unclipped dimensions of an element with scrolled or hidden overflow?
[13:38:33] <sneakyness> Where can I read about what's new in 1.7
[13:39:32] <`ini> i'm trying to pass a web page as a variable, but the : in the address is causing problems... any thoughts out there?
[13:40:04] <tharkun> `ini: try escaping it
[13:40:15] <tharkun> or use dns
[13:40:39] <S|acker> sneakyness: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/
[13:40:49] <chestnut> Hi! I would like to use .sortable() to reorder elements, placing the handle just outside the element bounding box. However, elements can't be dropped this way (see http://jsfiddle.net/LF6mb/ for an example). What am I doing wrong?
[13:40:50] <sneakyness> thanks babycakes
[13:41:21] <kollapse> Is there a big performance difference between $("tbody tr").on(event, fn) and $("tbody").on(event, "tr", fn) ?
[13:46:49] <`ini> when using \ \  or escape(), i still get errors. is there a better way to do it?
[13:46:50] <erichynds> kollapse: if you have a lot of tr's then yeah
[13:47:18] <kollapse> erichynds: Hmm. 10.000 trs ? :)
[13:53:17] <erichynds> kollapse: big time
[13:53:43] <Cade> How can I tell if an element is currently in the middle of an animation?
[13:54:12] <erichynds> $(elem).is(":animated")
[13:55:18] <Hopsy> I hate passwords #$%#%$&#@
[13:55:18] <Hopsy> it's just so much trouble!
[13:55:19] <aaronmcadam> Cade is.(':animated')
[13:55:20] <aaronmcadam> i was right woops
[13:55:21] <kollapse> erichynds: Hmm, I'm a little curious about just how big the difference is. I'll make a test case with 10.000 trs each with 6 tds (so 60.000 "cells" in total).
[13:55:49] <erichynds> kollapse: well, without delegation the same handler has to be bound to 10k elements one by one in a loop
[13:55:57] <erichynds> with delegation you're only binding to 1 element
[13:56:07] <aaronmcadam> yaaaay
[13:58:47] <ryanneufeld> erichynds: thanks for your blog post on deferreds, helped me out big time
[13:58:53] <erichynds> <3
[13:59:16] <ryanneufeld> should update it for 1.6+ though ')
[13:59:19] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[13:59:34] <erichynds> yeah
[13:59:36] <erichynds> 1.7 even
[13:59:47] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:59:49] <ryanneufeld> that too
[14:00:01] <ryanneufeld> given $.Callbacks
[14:01:02] <chestnut> How can I reorder elements if the handle is (physically) outside the elements bounding box? Please see http://jsfiddle.net/LF6mb/ for an example. Any hints are much appreciated.
[14:07:05] <ryanneufeld> chestnut: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/LF6mb/2/
[14:07:28] <amh345> hi guys, ive got an issue/question.   when i load pages via ajax the loaded pages dont get up and of the jquery in my main app.js file.   i have to include script tags within each of the pages and place the js there.   it's my understanding that the ajax page has no clue about the script in the main .js file.   my code is becoming an absolute mess because of it.  can anyone offer any guidance on how i can get this script to
[14:07:28] <amh345> be in the main js file?  any help would be appreciated.
[14:07:34] <ryanneufeld> chestnut: adjusting your css can give you the same appearance, without all the headache of elements being outside the sortable
[14:08:10] <amh345> pick up any the the jquery, i mean
[14:08:43] <jirwin> amh345: do you have an example?
[14:09:17] <jirwin> amh345: Are you trying to bind to events triggered by elements that you load through ajax?
[14:09:27] <amh345> jirwin: not really, no.  the pages that load via ajax are all serverside. i can try to mock sometihng up.
[14:09:48] <jirwin> amh345: I was really just asking what your test for failure is
[14:10:22] <jirwin> (what do you mean it doesn't 'pick up any jquery')
[14:10:57] <kollapse> erichynds: Big difference indeed. 10.000 rows with delegation = 16 ms, without delegation = 283 ms
[14:11:00] <amh345> jirwin: for example.    i load a page via ajax that has a href id="test".     if i want to have a click alert on that id "test" i need to put that click alert in the page itself.   if it's in the app.js file-  the click event wont work.
[14:11:25] <jirwin> alright. Thats what I was expecting. Checkout http://api.jquery.com/live/
[14:11:43] <aaronmcadam> nope
[14:11:46] <aaronmcadam> on/off baby
[14:12:10] <amh345> jirwin: thank you.   im going to test it out.
[14:12:15] <jirwin> amh345: good luck
[14:12:24] <amh345> looks simple enough to implement.   <famous last words>
[14:12:36] <jirwin> oh, looks like .live() is deprecated in 1.7
[14:12:40] <jirwin> so take note of that
[14:12:51] <aaronmcadam> just use on/off
[14:12:51] <chestnut> ryanneufeld: Thanks a lot! I will try and see if that does the trick (in my case, the sortable elements are already in a tight container div, so that I can't really make them wider -- do you have any thoughts on that?).
[14:13:02] <jirwin> aaronmcadam: ah, thats what you meant :P
[14:13:03] <jirwin> yeah
[14:13:05] <aaronmcadam> yes
[14:13:06] <jirwin> what he said.
[14:13:44] <ryanneufeld> chestnut: well, you can do some css sorcery to do it.
[14:13:55] <ryanneufeld> you can have the handle show up only on hover for example..
[14:14:06] <chrisdev> whats the right way to clear your keyboard handlers?
[14:15:08] <Renegade001> Has anyone any experience with the Reddit API?
[14:15:21] <Renegade001> Specifically, logging in via Javascript
[14:15:33] <chestnut> ryanneufeld: Ok, I'll give it a shot. Thanks for your help!
[14:17:41] <RaviJK> aaroonmcadam ryanneufeld  ... Hi
[14:17:53] <ryanneufeld> hey buddy...
[14:18:04] <ryanneufeld> chestnut: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/LF6mb/3/
[14:18:24] <RaviJK> Hi.. U good ? wanted do let you know where i ended up from yesterday's discussion
[14:19:06] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: I'm doing well, thanks, how did you make out?
[14:19:26] <RaviJK> I decided to dump jquery solution
[14:19:32] <RaviJK> i am doing it with ESI now
[14:19:47] <RaviJK> again on the edge, but less with JS
[14:20:19] <RaviJK> i have setup a server side process that does all the auth , but is outside of Drupal
[14:20:57] <RaviJK> Have a tiny ESI that gets called from Edge (Varnish) which does all the hardwork..  completed prototype, its looking good
[14:22:32] <kanzie> in the module-pattern, how do I access a public method (in the return) from a private function (outside the return)? Do I use this.
[14:22:49] <ryanneufeld> chestnut: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/LF6mb/4/
[14:23:07] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: sorry, ESI?
[14:23:32] <RaviJK> Edge side includes, something that Varnish , Akamai and other reverse proxies support
[14:23:53] <RaviJK> they are like Server side includes that are handled by Varnish
[14:24:23] <RaviJK> https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ESIfeatures
[14:24:43] <aaronmcadam> haha
[14:24:46] <aaronmcadam> same problem?
[14:25:07] <RaviJK> aaronmcadam with ESI, it turned out to be much simpler and elegent
[14:25:14] <aaronmcadam> does it work?
[14:25:28] <RaviJK> included a php , which would do redirects to CAS and back
[14:25:29] <RaviJK> yep
[14:25:33] <aaronmcadam> no js?
[14:25:34] <RaviJK> awsome
[14:25:58] <RaviJK> after hearing from you.. did u think i would dare to do JS solution :)
[14:26:03] <aaronmcadam> :D
[14:26:06] <aaronmcadam> good man RaviJK
[14:26:16] <aaronmcadam> glad u got it sorted, and did it the *right* way :D
[14:26:17] <ajpiano> omg
[14:26:22] <ajpiano> did talking some sense into someone worked
[14:26:24] * ajpiano celebrates
[14:26:28] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[14:26:30] * ajpiano high fives everyone
[14:26:37] * aaronmcadam high fives back!
[14:26:48] <RaviJK> aaronmcadam++ ,  ryanneufeld++
[14:27:16] <aaronmcadam> so ajpiano you remember the pattern I'm using, I think it's called a facade
[14:27:20] <aaronmcadam> tehee :D
[14:27:21] <RaviJK> thats good Karma incremented :)
[14:27:23] * ryanneufeld highfives everyone back
[14:27:38] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: glad to hear you found a more elegant solution
[14:27:43] <aaronmcadam> me and ryan are the advice team
[14:27:48] <ryanneufeld> I aplogize if I was dickhead about it ;P
[14:27:52] <aaronmcadam> haha
[14:28:04] <aaronmcadam> #negativity? ;)
[14:28:14] <RaviJK> ryanneufeld np .. its all in good faith
[14:28:14] <aaronmcadam> in this case tho we both needed to be dicks :D
[14:28:39] <RaviJK> before i jump into forums, i decide on a key rule .. all the suggestions are in good faith ..
[14:29:18] <RaviJK> beauty of open source ..... thank you so much .. really helped me a great deal
[14:29:19] <aaronmcadam> well I wish more people shared your attitude dude
[14:29:52] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: cool man
[14:29:53] <ryanneufeld> cool
[14:29:57] <RaviJK> cannot reveal the client just yet, but you can be sure your suggestions have gone into building among the most complex online broadcasting systems
[14:30:07] <chestnut> ryanneufeld: I can't keep up, sorry :-) The idea was to have a system similar to backpacks, c.f. (http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/833/backpacky.png/), with the drag handle outside of the main content area.
[14:30:50] <ryanneufeld> I don't know what that is
[14:31:08] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: I want a code credit :P
[14:31:21] <ryanneufeld> chestnut: I'm not sure how they did it
[14:31:59] <ryanneufeld> chestnut: you might be able to do it that way by changing the containment: 'parent', to the div that contains the UL
[14:32:00] <RaviJK> yep, when i put forward my solution, i mentioned the suggestions and our chat from yesterday
[14:32:06] <ryanneufeld> nice
[14:32:25] <RaviJK> "Spirit of opensource"
[14:32:54] <chestnut> ryanneufeld: You're right, I should look at their code. Thanks again, and sorry for bothering you so long!
[14:33:18] <ryanneufeld> chestnut: no worries man
[14:33:30] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: haha, I was mostly kidding :p
[14:33:54] <RaviJK> too everyone on this forum , ryanneufeld & aaronmcadam are two people that know what they are talking about... do take their suggestions seriously
[14:34:08] <MaxMeents> in jquery ui there is a duration option with addClass.. how would I just aquire that and nothing else?
[14:34:09] <ajpiano> RaviJK: i am very happy

[14:34:33] <ajpiano> #jquery success story
[14:34:48] <ryanneufeld> RaviJK: I have to give credit where it's due
[14:35:04] <ryanneufeld> I've had gnarf and ajpiano working directly on my code with me, so I've learned from the pros
[14:35:20] <ryanneufeld> and they have in turn made me more awesum
[14:35:28] <aaronmcadam> boucoup? :D
[14:35:47] <ryanneufeld> nope
[14:35:53] <gnarf> MaxMeents: include jquery.effects.core.js
[14:35:58] <RaviJK> ryanneufeld, agree with you .. working with peers is a major part of development..
[14:36:00] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: who's your favorite artist?
[14:36:05] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[14:36:10] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: mondrian

[14:40:20] <sl00> Hi. I am trying to get jqplot to work with an ajax/json source but somehow the xaxis categories do not line up. Does anyone have an example other than the one from the jqplot homepage?
[14:40:43] <jaequery> whats the best way of going about generating printable invoices? is it usually standard practice to just display it in HTML and have them print it out or does it have to be converted to PDF?
[14:42:02] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[14:42:08] <aaronmcadam> most likely pdf
[14:42:31] <aaronmcadam> but then it depends, if you want to stick to a good print stylesheet
[14:42:49] <aaronmcadam> i.e. if ur styling isn't too involved
[14:43:55] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: http://www.metrolyrics.com/pumped-up-kicks-lyrics-foster-the-people.html
[14:44:13] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: ajpiano helped me write the blue highlight thing over the lyrics
[14:44:33] <ryanneufeld> which get's so many hits now, that facebook throttles us down :p
[14:44:38] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[14:44:46] <aaronmcadam> bit jittery but nice
[14:45:37] <aaronmcadam> how does it decide which stanzas to highlight
[14:45:57] <aaronmcadam> oh is it set to 4 lines?
[14:46:26] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: you gotta ad the "amount of lines" incrementer
[14:46:27] <ajpiano> :D
[14:46:37] <aaronmcadam> i need to make dinner i'm staaarvin
[14:46:40] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: That's coming in a future release
[14:47:14] <ajpiano> sweet
[14:47:43] <aaronmcadam> i dunno, the content area could do with a bit more width or something
[14:47:49] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: you guys gunning for songmeanings.net now?
[14:48:15] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: kinda
[14:48:17] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[14:48:44] <ajpiano> you guys have better URLs lol
[14:48:52] <aaronmcadam> hahah hell; yeah
[14:49:10] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: we need a urlmeaningofsongmeanings.com
[14:49:14] <ryanneufeld> SEO is our key business :p
[14:49:34] <aaronmcadam> nooooooooooooooooooo
[14:49:37] <aaronmcadam> adaaaaam :O
[14:49:52] <aaronmcadam> who excessed his floods :(
[14:50:38] <aaronmcadam> ryanneufeld: I think it would help a lot if some of the left padding was reduced
[14:50:43] <aaronmcadam> in the content area
[14:51:12] <aaronmcadam> i dunno tho, the content seems squashed between all the ads and other distractions
[14:51:56] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: ?
[14:52:31] <ryanneufeld> Hey guys, I just published our first chrome extension! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pkjomccnobbpfpbgdldlefchdnefcioj?hl=en&gl=CA
[14:53:25] <smplstk> gotta love those webstore urls
[14:53:26] <ryanneufeld> does that work for anyone yet?
[14:53:42] <smplstk> ryanneufeld: the link?
[14:54:41] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:54:53] <smplstk> worked for me.
[14:56:15] <ryanneufeld> nice
[14:56:30] <ryanneufeld> Check it out guys, we'd love some reviews!
[14:56:44] <jirwin> ryanneufeld: url again?
[14:57:01] <ryanneufeld> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pkjomccnobbpfpbgdldlefchdnefcioj?hl=en&gl=CA
[14:58:03] <jirwin> lyric sites are a tough market to break into
[15:02:18] <ryanneufeld> jirwin: we're not breaking into it dude
[15:02:35] <jirwin> oh I know
[15:02:39] <ryanneufeld> ah, k
[15:02:40] <jirwin> it was just a mental sidenote
[15:02:48] <ryanneufeld> and yes it's tough
[15:02:56] <jirwin> I've dreamed of making a great lyrics site
[15:03:12] <jirwin> but aol/metrolyrics is sort of a big beast, not to mention the SEO game you have to play
[15:06:19] <detailiffanu> hi
[15:06:27] <detailiffanu> how can i optimize these ajax requests - http://www.trolls.lv/ ?
[15:06:45] <detailiffanu> posts are fetched until container is filled
[15:06:51] <detailiffanu> works on resize too
[15:07:01] <detailiffanu> however takes a bit too long
[15:07:26] <detailiffanu> i can increase chunk, so they will be fetched no by 1 , but by 4-6. but this is a bit dirty
[15:10:05] <detailiffanu> also i would like then from bottom to top
[15:11:09] <sneakyness> oh man, so many 1.7 articles to read through
[15:13:07] <sneakyness> should I read about deferred or callbacks first?
[15:13:48] <sneakyness> this promises stuff is new to me
[15:21:40] <acidjazz> INTERIOR CROCODILE ALLIGATOR
[15:21:42] <acidjazz> I DRIVE A CHEVROLET MOVIE THEATRE
[15:23:09] <idlesysop> is this the proper way to call a public method with the widget factory? $('#slideshow').data('flipper').flipSlide(self, 'next');
[15:28:34] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: http://www.metrolyrics.com/c-thomas-howell-as-the-soul-man-lyrics-botch.html
[15:29:13] <ryanneufeld> jirwin: we're not AOL anymore we're CBS now
[15:34:03] <sneakyness> so let me get this straight, with the deffered stuff, bascially, you make a request, then create an object, and attach the callback to that object
[15:34:13] <sneakyness> so it's like placeholders for content that will show up
[15:34:22] <sneakyness> on a more granular scale
[15:34:26] <jirwin> ryanneufeld: thats good to know at least
[15:35:32] <jirwin> ryanneufeld: have you ever looked at http://www.rapgenius.com
[15:35:34] <jirwin> ?
[15:40:27] <ryanneufeld> jirwin: ....yeah.....
[15:46:30] <patrick99e99> I am trying to dynamically call a method on a jquery object but am having a problem
[15:46:37] <patrick99e99> x = $('#foo')
[15:46:44] <patrick99e99> y = "show"
[15:46:52] <patrick99e99> x[y].apply(this, [])
[15:47:04] <patrick99e99> I get "this._show is undefiend"
[15:47:07] <patrick99e99> *defined
[15:48:51] <xarxer> Can one create a jquery script so that when I hover over a certain div, everything else gets darker, except for that div?
[15:49:54] <ryanneufeld> xarxer: yes, one can
[15:50:22] <xarxer> ryanneufeld: Might there be an example you know of?
[15:50:44] <ryanneufeld> what you're looking for is called a light box
[15:50:58] <ryanneufeld> oh, hover
[15:51:05] <ryanneufeld> that's alittle different
[15:51:16] <ryanneufeld> not sure how you'd do it
[15:51:23] <ryanneufeld> but it could be done
[15:51:29] <xarxer> hmm okay
[15:51:47] <dabear> patrick99e99: .apply(x, []) ?
[15:53:12] <danzik17> patrick99e99: if you want to do that, you need to do jQuery.fn[y].apply( x, [])
[15:57:41] <patrick99e99> danzik17: thank you!
[16:33:26] <jzaksh> hi, this might not be jquery specific.. not sure. i want to call a .val() or .html() depending on a single condition. i have "html" or "val" in a string variable "meth"... .. with a given object i want to do object.[meth] .. is there some way to do this?
[16:33:54] <jzaksh> i tried object.apply(meth) -- but i get an error "apply is not a method of obj".. so i guess i don't undertand apply/call quite well.
[16:35:27] <erichynds> obj[ condition ? "html" : "val" ]()
[16:35:58] <jzaksh> aww
[16:39:16] <patrick99e99> is there any difference to doing $('input:radio') and $('input[type=radio]')  ?
[16:39:46] <dabear> you get the same result
[16:40:36] <jzaksh> erichynds: thanks! :)
[16:40:43] <erichynds> no problem
[16:40:53] <erichynds> patrick99e99: one uses querySelectorAll if it's available
[16:41:18] <patrick99e99> erichynds: I guess what I am asking is-- is one more efficient than other?
[16:41:24] <erichynds> yes
[16:41:28] <erichynds> the latter is more effecient
[16:43:52] <sorahn> hey guys, i'm looking for a way to have an image open a dropdown when you click it.  IS that possible?
[16:47:19] <patrick99e99> sorahn: all things are possible
[16:50:57] <sorahn> patrick99e99: do you happen to have a place i could look for that?  i'm turning up empty on searches.
[16:51:24] <sorahn> i could easily have a hidden div, that i show, with the select menu in it, but ideally it wouldn't take 2 clicks to get to it, just the first click would open it.
[16:59:01] <patrick99e99> sorahn: what do you want to do exactly?
[17:20:47] <k1ng> please recommend me a color picker
[17:25:41] <imsky> WAT

[17:27:01] <abjorn> today was? this was the week
[17:27:04] <imsky> so i'm not glad, moar fearful
[17:27:09] <abjorn> lol
[17:27:13] <abjorn> why will it be hell
[17:27:41] <imsky> ehh got a bunch of school stuff on monday, exams and such. then have to prepare for a bunch of meetings
[17:27:50] <abjorn> that gay as all hell
[17:27:57] <abjorn> I had a customer the other day
[17:28:00] <imsky> i think that's gay as hell too
[17:28:05] <abjorn> who kept asking the same thing for an hour and a half
[17:28:18] <abjorn> he wanted me to extend the due date on an invoice that had already been extended
[17:28:19] <abjorn> no go
[17:28:26] <abjorn> fucker wouldn't take no for an answer
[17:28:28] <abjorn> he just kept begging
[17:28:37] <imsky> why didn't you just say yes
[17:28:40] <abjorn> mofo never pays his bills on time too
[17:28:47] <imsky> and then shut off his webternetz
[17:28:59] <abjorn> because that would be bad
[17:29:00] <imsky> U PAY OR UR SITE = 127.0.0.1
[17:29:04] <abjorn> best case: I get written up
[17:29:08] <abjorn> worst case: I get fired
[17:29:19] <imsky> so what ended up happening?
[17:29:50] <abjorn> he said he was upset then started a new chat with someone else to do the same thing to them
[17:29:55] <imsky> lolol
[17:30:03] <imsky> why isn't there a policy to turn off service to deadbeats?
[17:30:08] <imsky> i see that shit happening all the time
[17:30:17] <abjorn> we suspend accounts when they dont pay their bills
[17:30:38] <imsky> wasn't that the case?
[17:30:38] <abjorn> we don't suspend right after the due date, but after some time we do
[17:30:49] <imsky> oh ok so he just wanted to be suspended later
[17:30:51] <k1ng> please recommend me a color picker
[17:30:53] <abjorn> yeah basically
[17:30:59] <abjorn> then it's like
[17:31:03] <abjorn> months before we cancel the thing
[17:31:06] <imsky> k1ng: the one on colorzilla, same one as photoshop's
[17:31:25] <abjorn> we go through and audit accounts (meaning we go and cancel accounts that have been suspended a long time) like twice a year
[17:31:36] <abjorn> so its not like he wouldn't get it back
[17:31:39] <imsky> k1ng: they got one in the gradient maker: http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[17:31:41] <k1ng> imsky, i need a jquery version :)
[17:31:43] <Druid_> hm... offtopic question.. how do you handle assets? e.g. images (logo / icons) in your VCS? just add them?
[17:31:47] <imsky> k1ng: lol noap
[17:31:53] <abjorn> Druid_: Yeah
[17:31:54] <imsky> Druid_: yeah why not
[17:31:58] <imsky> are you scurred
[17:31:58] <abjorn> but I use git so its okay
[17:32:02] <k1ng> imsky, for website
[17:32:03] <abjorn> in svn its like
[17:32:10] <Druid_> working on with symfony2 right now
[17:32:12] <imsky> abjorn: why do it manually? isn't there just a bash script
[17:32:14] <abjorn> "lol you wanna version control anything thats not text? fuck you"
[17:32:23] <abjorn> imsky: we don't do it manually
[17:32:24] <imsky> fossil + git work ok
[17:32:37] <imsky> abjorn: gotcha
[17:32:41] <abjorn> it's a script that runs on the servers
[17:32:43] <imsky> so did he ever extend it?
[17:32:46] <abjorn> we just don't run it often
[17:32:50] <abjorn> idk
[17:32:53] <abjorn> probably not
[17:33:00] <imsky> wat a sleazy douchebaguette
[17:33:06] <abjorn> no just an idiot
[17:33:23] <imsky> hot damn
[17:33:28] <Druid_> never heard of fossil
[17:33:35] <imsky> so why are you on irc at 8:30, abjorn
[17:33:39] <ravenzz> abjorn just mail him a backup and suspend his account!

[17:33:57] <imsky> hack on proto engine, duh
[17:34:00] <abjorn> too young to go to bars
[17:34:02] <abjorn> i might
[17:34:09] <abjorn> id be home either way though :p
[17:34:17] <imsky> lol i'm not too young for bars...and yet they do not compel me
[17:34:24] <abjorn> well they wouldn't compel me either
[17:34:25] <imsky> to go to them
[17:34:27] <abjorn> just saying though
[17:34:28] <imsky> and get wasted
[17:34:52] <imsky> shit i got so many ideas i need to work on
[17:35:12] <imsky> abjorn: cssfx got a slight upgrayedd
[17:35:16] <abjorn> why is newegg sending me an email suggesting an DC to AC inverter
[17:35:21] <imsky> oh
[17:35:29] <abjorn> i have like
[17:35:31] <abjorn> 0 use for that
[17:35:39] <imsky> and some bro who owns cssfx.com sent me an email with some weird ass dialect
[17:35:50] <imsky> apparently i owe him copyright dues or something
[17:35:59] <imsky> haven't heard back from him yet
[17:36:04] <abjorn> is it an actual company
[17:36:12] <imsky> no it's an email harvester that doesn't work
[17:36:18] <imsky> but abjorn http://imsky.github.com/cssFx/
[17:36:22] <imsky> PREFIXES WHILE U WAIT
[17:36:32] <imsky> lea verou also came out with her own take on this thing, but her shit's jquery-dependent
[17:36:39] <imsky> and doesn't support @import
[17:36:43] <abjorn> sweet as shit
[17:36:56] <abjorn> i dont get what cssfx.com is
[17:37:03] <imsky> it's a thing he'll never get done
[17:37:13] <imsky> apparently it's a blog or some shit: http://blog.cssfx.com
[17:37:22] <juha_> anyone who's worked with fancybox, ever ran into problem like this: http://imgur.com/VdYkB ?
[17:37:23] <imsky> last update: may 27
[17:37:38] <juha_> i have the exact same code working just fine on another site, which is weird..
[17:38:00] <abjorn> juha_: can't load the image, maybe?
[17:38:20] <abjorn> imsky: what a loser, he thinks he has legal rights just cause he has a domain name
[17:38:22] <abjorn> lololol
[17:38:36] <imsky> i know, i even looked it up in the catalogue just to hammer the point home
[17:38:45] <imsky> guy's a joke
[17:38:48] <juha_> abjorn: it's laoding html content, i can see the html on network tab in devtools
[17:38:56] <sneakyness> are there any good jsfiddles laying around that exemplify some of this fancy $.Callbacks(); stuff?
[17:39:09] <imsky> sneakyness: yeah i got a whole shipping crate full of fiddles
[17:39:15] <juha_> abjorn: i can also find the html with devtools, seems that fancybox isn't rendering width/height properly
[17:39:26] <abjorn> hm, weird
[17:39:27] <sneakyness> I have this one that I just made but I'm lazy http://jsfiddle.net/ZmWMh/
[17:39:30] <abjorn> dunno i dont really use fancybox
[17:39:31] <abjorn> or any box
[17:39:36] <juha_> http://pastie.org/2812939
[17:39:53] <abjorn> I was just making a blind guess :D
[17:40:14] <juha_> i'm using same code on another project which makes this really weird..
[17:40:40] <imsky> then it's not the code
[17:41:06] <abjorn> imsky: that's not necessarily true, it could be the same code, but his setup could be different, in a way that his code doesn't expect
[17:41:14] <abjorn> but yeah
[17:41:16] <abjorn> point is
[17:41:19] <abjorn> doin sumin wrong
[17:41:21] <imsky> but then it's still not the code
[17:41:32] <abjorn> ur not the same code
[17:41:40] <juha_> fuu, something in the css breaking it, just overwrote the css with the css of the other project and fancybox working
[17:41:44] <juha_> fuuuu
[17:41:48] <imsky> why are you building proto anyway, abjorn
[17:41:49] <abjorn> fuuuuu
[17:41:56] <abjorn> imsky: there's a game I wanna make
[17:42:00] <abjorn> been planning for like
[17:42:01] <abjorn> 5 years
[17:42:02] <imsky> I AM THE SAME CODE
[17:42:15] <discountrobot> how the heck can i keep multiple transforms with Jquery?
[17:42:24] <imsky> as you white people
[17:42:24] <imsky> abjorn: probably time to make it
[17:42:28] <abjorn> lol
[17:42:37] <abjorn> im not in a hurry
[17:42:51] <imsky> trust me, everything i wanted to do when i was 1* is still relevant today
[17:42:55] <imsky> be in a hurry
[17:43:00] <abjorn> i wanna fork cssfx just for the sake of forking it
[17:43:04] <imsky> plz do
[17:43:11] <imsky> it's now loosely coupled
[17:43:15] <abjorn> but i have nothing significant to do to it
[17:43:16] <imsky> so you can build a framework around it
[17:43:20] <imsky> dude, really?
[17:43:27] <imsky> how about css3 transition jq-wiggle
[17:43:32] <abjorn> hmmmmm
[17:44:15] * imsky wiggles as this is a great idea
[17:44:25] <abjorn> how would that work
[17:44:33] <imsky> do you not know how to do css3 animations?
[17:44:40] <abjorn> vaguely
[17:44:54] <imsky> well, all ya gotta do is just create a bunch of keyframe declarations
[17:44:54] <abjorn> ill look it up
[17:45:01] <imsky> and then get the ball rolling
[17:45:19] <imsky> if you want, you can work on the hard problem of cssfx:
[17:45:28] <imsky> re-styling elements that change properties
[17:45:37] <imsky> i'm not touching that beast for a while
[17:45:42] <abjorn> lol neither am i
[17:45:54] <imsky> shit's hard
[17:46:34] <imsky> what's the game you want to make?
[17:46:55] <abjorn> basicallyyyyy
[17:46:56] <ravenzz> moremandy
[17:46:56] <abjorn> like
[17:47:04] <ravenzz> it was an old .exe porn
[17:47:07] <abjorn> rpg/adventure/zelda kinda style
[17:47:09] <imsky> what the hell
[17:47:13] <imsky> who is this ravenzz dude
[17:47:25] <imsky> abjorn: and you're building proto for this?
[17:47:29] <ravenzz> gh
[17:47:42] <abjorn> like you play a guy who wants to overthrow the king of his whatevernation, and it's all open ended, so the decisions you make during the game affect the overall reason you want to do it, when it's finally revealed
[17:47:53] <abjorn> which i know makes no sense, because you should know the reason already since you're the person doing it but
[17:48:10] <abjorn> imsky: more or less
[17:48:10] <imsky> so why aren't you already working on this
[17:48:23] <imsky> how much of sfml do you really need to port
[17:48:24] <abjorn> and because I think the world needs a js game engine that isn't browser based
[17:48:30] <abjorn> and doesn't suck like spherical
[17:48:48] <abjorn> or sphere, or whatever its called, i forgot
[17:49:00] <abjorn> sphere, that was it. oldass engine using an old version of spidermonkey
[17:49:08] <abjorn> slow as balls, terrible design
[17:49:23] <imsky> it's from 2008
[17:49:36] <imsky> lol get with it bro
[17:49:43] <abjorn> it's older than that
[17:49:50] <abjorn> that's just the last time it was updated
[17:49:55] <imsky> ye ye, i read the pedia
[17:50:00] <abjorn> community is almost dead
[17:50:03] <imsky> anyway, make the game
[17:50:09] <abjorn> yeahyeahyeah whatever
[17:50:10] <abjorn> homo
[17:50:12] <abjorn> <3
[17:50:16] <imsky> you should probably have the whole fsm done by now
[17:50:25] <imsky> and you could just plug it into everything
[17:50:33] <imsky> android, ios, web, and proto
[17:50:34] <abjorn> transform: wiggle(5, 2, 200);
[17:50:38] <imsky> word up
[17:50:52] <abjorn> it must be done.
[17:51:10] <imsky> hmm an easter egg inside cssfx?
[17:51:22] <imsky> challenge accepted
[17:51:28] <abjorn> yeah
[17:51:39] <abjorn> gonna have to basically rewrite jq-wiggle to not rely on jquery though lol
[17:52:02] <imsky> easy peasy, use qwery, domready, and some other stuff from ender
[17:52:09] <imsky> ded is a beast at microcode
[17:52:21] <abjorn> lol
[17:52:52] <imsky> i wonder if it's possible to write javascript in bytecode and then eval it on load
[17:53:00] <imsky> that way you can shrink a ton of instructions inside unicode
[17:53:05] <abjorn> well
[17:53:10] <abjorn> it is in the v8 api
[17:53:16] <imsky> no i mean, clientside
[17:53:18] <abjorn> I know
[17:53:19] <imsky> nothing fancy
[17:53:24] <abjorn> just sayin
[17:53:25] <abjorn> lol
[17:53:28] <abjorn> "nothing fancy"
[17:53:33] <imsky> word up, i bet those guys just want to push nacl though
[17:53:33] <abjorn> yeah thats not fancy at all
[17:53:46] <imsky> here's some native code for you pl0x
[17:53:50] <abjorn> eval'ing bytecode, simple stuff, right right
[17:54:02] <abjorn> man my mind is like
[17:54:03] <abjorn> tapped out
[17:54:09] <abjorn> im trying to write code
[17:54:10] <imsky> you need to start drinkin
[17:54:11] <abjorn> but my brain is like
[17:54:13] <abjorn> "fuck you"
[17:54:24] <imsky> that's because you probably don't feel strongly about your goal
[17:54:41] <imsky> and also you're not drinkin
[17:55:07] <abjorn> I DON'T FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT ANYTHING
[17:55:13] <imsky> the curse of generation y
[17:55:20] <abjorn> lol
[17:55:56] <imsky> hmm well if you're all fucked up about proto, write some bullshit for js1k or 140bytes
[17:56:35] <imsky> create a series of squares that are colored according to the input string
[17:56:40] <imsky> boom, 140bytes challenge
[17:56:45] <imsky> or maybe 1k
[17:56:47] <abjorn> wiggle in 140 bytes
[17:56:49] <imsky> canvas is a beast
[17:56:56] <imsky> hmmm wiggle in 140?
[17:57:01] <imsky> ok you're on grandpa
[17:57:05] <abjorn> rofl
[17:57:16] <imsky> first question
[17:57:18] <imsky> can we use jquery
[17:57:31] <abjorn> depends on your difficulty
[17:57:32] <imsky> it's what grandpas don't use
[17:57:41] <abjorn> Hard Mode: Yes
[17:57:41] <abjorn> Nightmare Mode: No
[17:57:50] <imsky> ok we'll see how it goes
[17:57:57] <imsky> why does jsfiddle default to mootools
[17:58:01] <imsky> who the hell uses mootools
[17:58:07] <abjorn> jsfiddle i guess
[18:01:15] <imsky> animation is broken for me waat
[18:02:12] <imsky> damn you css position property
[18:03:18] <imsky> they tried to make me go to reeeehaab
[18:03:53] <abjorn> lol
[18:04:00] <abjorn> im trying this
[18:04:01] <abjorn> this is hard
[18:04:10] <imsky> i will beat you
[18:04:15] <imsky> i will eat* you
[18:09:29] <abjorn> imsky: nuh uh
[18:09:39] <imsky> painis cupcake agrees with me
[18:11:29] <imsky> successful prototype: check
[18:11:41] <imsky> 133 bytes
[18:13:47] <abjorn> 160 bytes D:
[18:13:55] <imsky> does yours wiggle forever?
[18:14:33] <abjorn> yes
[18:14:38] <imsky> good, good
[18:15:01] <imsky> i'm adding the option to mine
[18:15:25] <abjorn> why must it be Math.random and not Math.rand, or better yet, just rand
[18:15:33] <imsky> why are you using rand
[18:15:39] <abjorn> because
[18:15:46] <imsky> u r dum
[18:16:50] <abjorn> ur dum
[18:17:26] <imsky> ok i'm taking the limit out
[18:17:29] <imsky> infinite wiggling is boss
[18:18:35] <imsky> what to add in the remaining 7 bytes..hmm
[18:19:42] <abjorn> ffff hit f5
[18:19:43] <abjorn> lost it all
[18:19:45] <abjorn> igiveup
[18:19:48] <imsky> lolol
[18:20:28] <imsky> does yours include the .ready handler
[18:20:32] <abjorn> no
[18:20:37] <imsky> you cheating sack of shit
[18:20:40] <abjorn> lol
[18:20:59] <abjorn> ur a cheating sack of cheating
[18:21:00] <imsky> k well since you lost yours
[18:21:06] <imsky> i present my 133 byte pile of awesomeness
[18:21:14] <imsky> that works instantly, JUST DROP HER IN
[18:21:15] <imsky> $().ready(wiggle);function wiggle(b,a){$("#test").animate({left:(a==1?"+":"-")+"=10"},500,function(){wiggle(b,a==undefined?1:0-a)})};
[18:21:23] <imsky> shit, forgot the "#test" thing
[18:21:32] <imsky> ah they'll figure it out
[18:22:03] <imsky> http://jsfiddle.net/2HAe9/
[18:22:05] <imsky> works like a champion
[18:23:03] <imsky> in retrospect, wiggle could be shortened to w
[18:23:13] <imsky> please hold while i stick more crap into this function
[18:23:33] <imsky> ahh yes, 118 bytes
[18:25:08] <abjorn> what
[18:25:10] <abjorn> why no mario
[18:25:23] <imsky> did you write an ascii mario in there or something
[18:25:27] <imsky> this is just proof of concept
[18:25:28] <abjorn> no
[18:25:31] <abjorn> the mario image
[18:25:34] <abjorn> from the jq-wiggle demo
[18:25:35] <imsky> IT WILL BE THERE
[18:25:43] <imsky> i'm working on some new stuff to make it more user friendly
[18:31:54] <imsky> ok down to 125 bytes
[18:34:00] <imsky> 112 bytes, keep up son
[18:35:17] <abjorn> :c
[18:35:20] <abjorn> nah
[18:35:21] <abjorn> is stopped :(
[18:35:25] <imsky> now with mario :D
[18:35:25] <abjorn> *i
[18:35:35] <imsky> http://jsfiddle.net/2HAe9/1/
[18:35:39] <imsky> $(document).ready(w);function w(b,a){$("#test").animate({left:(a>0?"+":"-")+"=10"},500,function(){w(b,1-!!a)})};
[18:35:43] <imsky> oh shit why the document
[18:35:56] <imsky> $().ready(w);function w(b,a){$("#test").animate({left:(a>0?"+":"-")+"=10"},500,function(){w(b,1-!!a)})};
[18:36:00] <imsky> 104 bytes awwww yeah
[18:37:50] <abjorn> why not $(w)
[18:37:58] <imsky> hmm
[18:37:59] <imsky> jesus
[18:38:16] <imsky> 96 bytes
[18:38:19] <imsky> now in the double digits
[18:38:21] <abjorn> lol
[18:38:23] <imsky> $(w);function w(b,a){$("#test").animate({left:(a>0?"+":"-")+"=10"},500,function(){w(b,1-!!a)})};
[18:38:25] <imsky> bam
[18:38:31] <imsky> the biggest thing here is the selector
[18:38:35] <abjorn> lol
[18:38:48] <abjorn> best code tweet ever
[18:38:54] <imsky> hold on don't post yet
[18:39:05] <imsky> what can we add here
[18:39:09] <imsky> what did jq wiggle have
[18:39:35] <imsky> oh yeah, rotation and random range of wiggle
[18:42:34] <imsky> unpredictable wiggling: achieved
[18:43:36] <abjorn> wigglan
[18:43:48] <abjorn> forget #poopin
[18:43:49] <abjorn> #wigglin
[18:43:53] <imsky> lolwut
[18:45:34] <imsky> ah dammit, rotation bumped me up to 177
[18:52:48] <imsky> ok rotation's out
[18:52:52] <imsky> back to 121
[18:52:54] <imsky> $(w);function w(b,a){var c=Math.random();$("#t").animate({left:(a?"+":"-")+"="+(5+(0|c*5))},500,function(){w(b,1-!!a)})};
[18:53:35] <Eviltwin> Are we golfing again?
[18:53:47] <imsky> abjorn checked out early
[18:54:12] <abjorn> yeah :(
[18:54:58] <imsky> ok 113 bytes, posting this bad boy
[18:56:12] <Eviltwin> Can you do "-+"[~a] instead of a?"+":"-" ?
[18:56:31] <Eviltwin> Actually instead of (a?"+":"-")
[18:56:52] <Eviltwin> Rather !a
[18:56:53] <imsky> are you coercing to -1 in there?
[18:56:56] <imsky> or something else
[18:57:07] <Eviltwin> I meant !a
[18:57:14] <imsky> hmm
[18:57:17] <Eviltwin> NVM
[18:57:20] <Eviltwin> I don't know if it will work
[18:57:29] <Eviltwin> Maybe 0|
[18:57:32] <imsky> oh i see what you mean
[18:57:33] <imsky> good idea
[18:57:39] <Eviltwin> Depends on what a is
[18:57:52] <imsky> it does work
[18:57:53] <imsky> one sec
[18:58:34] <imsky> down to 112 bytes, good job :D
[18:58:55] <Eviltwin> Is a ever not 0 or 1?
[18:59:07] <imsky> it's always 0 or 1
[18:59:14] <imsky> it already works bud, thanks for the tip
[18:59:19] <Eviltwin> What's the purpose of 1-!!a then?
[19:00:07] <Eviltwin> Is that not the same as 1-a for a=0 or a=1?
[19:00:13] <imsky> a may be undefined
[19:00:21] <imsky> so i coerce it with the double bang to a boolean
[19:00:59] <imsky> down to 110 now...wonder what else we can put in here
[19:01:51] <lolgolflol> Hi.
[19:01:52] <Eviltwin> Instead of function w(a,b){var c=Math.random()...} use function w(a,b,c){c=Math.random()...}
[19:01:55] <Eviltwin> 2 bytes
[19:02:01] <imsky> who is lolgolflol
[19:02:06] <imsky> don't mock our pastime
[19:02:21] <imsky> Eviltwin: already took that out, was legacy code
[19:02:25] <lolgolflol> Who use limechat ?
[19:02:37] <imsky> i was reusing c for rotation, but it was too bulky
[19:03:09] <Eviltwin> Well lets see your latest
[19:03:43] <imsky> $(w);function w(b,a){$("#t").animate({left:"+-"[+a]+"="+(8+(0|Math.random()*9))},500,function(){w(b,1-!!a)})};
[19:03:45] * Eviltwin is watching Swordfish
[19:03:58] <Eviltwin> Why the two args?
[19:04:04] <Eviltwin> For jQuery?
[19:04:09] <imsky> yeah, damn jquery
[19:04:16] <Eviltwin> Oh, nice call with the +
[19:04:19] <imsky> oh maybe i can omit it in the second call
[19:04:19] <Eviltwin> Since it's already an int
[19:04:30] <Eviltwin> Probably
[19:04:33] <imsky> it's not
[19:04:46] <imsky> nope can't omit it
[19:04:47] <imsky> damn
[19:05:06] <imsky> i think that's as close as i'll get it without adding some crazy stuff
[19:05:20] <Eviltwin> Thought
[19:05:30] <Eviltwin> Just use !a instead of 1-!!a
[19:05:50] <imsky> oh right
[19:05:53] <imsky> makes sense, doesn't it
[19:06:22] <imsky> but actually wait
[19:06:45] <Eviltwin> +true === 1
[19:06:48] <imsky> so just doing !(undefined) makes it into true
[19:06:48] <Eviltwin> +false === 0
[19:06:57] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:07:02] <Eviltwin> Since undefined is fasly
[19:07:06] <imsky> right right
[19:07:09] <Eviltwin> falsy*
[19:07:11] <imsky> i was trying to be fancy
[19:07:28] <Eviltwin> Nothing about golfing is fancy
[19:07:36] <imsky> down to 107
[19:08:38] <Eviltwin> So you still aren't using b...
[19:08:49] <imsky> can't really use it, it's just jQuery()
[19:08:59] <imsky> took out rounding as well, -2 chars
[19:09:12] <Eviltwin> What are you at now?
[19:09:16] <imsky> 105
[19:09:26] <Eviltwin> I mean the code
[19:09:29] <imsky> oh
[19:09:39] <imsky> $(w);function w(b,a){$("#t").animate({left:"+-"[+a]+"="+(8+Math.random()*9)},500,function(){w(b,!a)})};
[19:09:48] <imsky> actually 103
[19:10:36] <Eviltwin> Isn't +undefined NaN?
[19:10:48] <imsky> certainly is
[19:10:54] <imsky> ?js +(undefined)
[19:10:58] <Eviltwin> Isn't a undefined?
[19:11:00] <imsky> bot-t is taking a rest
[19:11:08] <imsky> hmmm a is only undefined at first
[19:11:18] <imsky> after that it's converted
[19:11:26] <Eviltwin> +!a?
[19:11:31] <imsky> why?
[19:11:50] <Eviltwin> "+-"[NaN] is undefined
[19:12:02] <imsky> oh hmm
[19:12:04] <bot-t> imsky: NaN
[19:12:05] <imsky> good point
[19:12:12] <imsky> it works though
[19:12:17] <alphaman> I want to build an input box where whenever we type something and press enter, the text should appear at the center of the page... to do this, I am using the keyPress() event and checking if event.check == 13 (for the enter key)... but this doesn;t work... any idea whats wrong?
[19:12:23] <Eviltwin> Because you're first hitting "undefined=..."
[19:12:40] <alphaman> I am sorry event.which I meant
[19:13:01] <Eviltwin> How about $(w);function w(a){$("#t").animate({left:"+-"[+!a]+"="+(8+Math.random()*9)},500,function(){w(!a)})};
[19:13:35] <imsky> well that can work, but why bother?
[19:13:46] <Eviltwin> You saved the b's
[19:13:56] <Eviltwin> And now the first iteration counts
[19:14:03] <imsky> i have no choice with the b's
[19:14:11] <Eviltwin> Why not?
[19:14:18] <imsky> ok how do i take them out?
[19:14:23] <Eviltwin> I just did
[19:14:34] <imsky> oh wait
[19:14:35] <black_warlock> hi
[19:14:38] <imsky> that's not going to work
[19:14:41] <Eviltwin> Why not?
[19:14:49] <imsky> let me check
[19:15:02] <black_warlock> i have a question
[19:15:09] <imsky> what black magic is this
[19:15:14] <black_warlock> im using this jq plugin
[19:15:17] <black_warlock> http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/#about
[19:15:29] <imsky> ohhh
[19:15:35] <imsky> you're casting the function to boolean
[19:15:37] <black_warlock> im using the last option
[19:15:42] <imsky> man that is pretty spiffy
[19:15:45] <Eviltwin> Yup
[19:15:46] <black_warlock> with fade in out
[19:15:49] <black_warlock> but
[19:16:02] <imsky> we are now at 100 bytes
[19:16:04] <black_warlock> id like to add the selected value to an input field
[19:16:30] <black_warlock> to an hidden input field
[19:17:05] <black_warlock> i was thinking to add the line after >>> onChange: function (hsb, hex, rgb) {
[19:17:32] <black_warlock> and exactlly $('#colorpickerField2').val(hex);
[19:17:33] <Eviltwin> imsky: Not seeing too much more we can do
[19:17:43] <imsky> me neither...wondering if there's anything to add
[19:19:06] <black_warlock> who can help me ?
[19:19:14] <imsky> oh this is a beauty: $(w);function w(a){$("#t").clone().appendTo("body").animate({left:("+-")[+!a]+"="+(8+Math.random()*9)},500,function(){w(!a)})};
[19:19:16] <imsky> a path of marios
[19:19:26] <Eviltwin> HA ha ha
[19:19:45] <imsky> good job Eviltwin
[19:19:49] <Eviltwin> Thanks
[19:20:04] <imsky> you have served the wiggling forces proudly
[19:21:08] <alphaman> if i have defined both $(document).keypress and $("input").keydown and then I press some key in the input box, which one will be called?
[19:21:30] <imsky> abjorn: i salute you little bugger, check the twitters
[19:21:59] <abjorn> fukya

[19:22:48] <imsky> get some smirnoff and turn on some deadmau5
[19:23:46] <imsky> Eviltwin: if javascript was a better language, we wouldn't be able to do such nasty things to it
[19:24:01] <imsky> dirty, dirty things. brown paper bag kinda things
[19:24:21] <black_warlock> ill wait tomorrow for dj =|
[19:24:49] <imsky> black_warlock: you're going to wait to do .val($("el").val())

[19:40:06] <black_warlock> i give up ill try tomorrow
[19:40:10] <black_warlock> gnight
[20:01:03] <jimmyz22> I"m trying to add an item to a select using the  "new Option(index, value);", however if value is a string that includes a '+' character it errors, out.
[20:01:25] <jimmyz22> I can replace this + with \\+ and then it works but shows up in the listbox as '\+'
[20:01:32] <jimmyz22> any ideas how to resolve this?
[20:08:12] <danzik17> jimmyz22: just create an option element - dont use new Option
[20:17:45] <conee> not sure if this is the right place to ask, but i have a handler bound to hashchange currently that works fine, except when the user comes in with a hash already in the url (ie, www.foobar.com/test#hash).  i'm binding to the hashchange event after ready, and the code that executes is tab changes.
[20:18:21] <jimmyz22> danzik17, you mean just use append and create the option that way?
[20:18:27] <jimmyz22> I've already tried that.
[20:18:31] <conee> i have two theories: the tabs are not finished being initialized when the user comes in with a hash, OR i'm binding the hashchange event too late to pick up the incoming URL hash
[20:18:42] <conee> does anyone know what i'm doing wrong or how i should approach this?
[20:21:45] <danzik17> jimmyz22: and what happened
[20:23:17] <jimmyz22> oh same thing.
[20:23:34] <jimmyz22> Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [value=Dedup-Mem+LZO-Compression_HTTP_Baseline]
[20:26:08] <jimmyz22> Here's the code:
[20:26:09] <jimmyz22> http://jsfiddle.net/mz8EW/
[20:50:05] <lolgolflol> Is errors line $("#selectleft option[value=" + value + "]").remove(); ?
[20:51:11] <patrick99e99> does jquery have a unique identifier for elements ?
[20:51:28] <lolgolflol> if yes, I think value as param in incorrect.
[20:51:58] <patrick99e99> in other words..  lets say I have an item that I got from another function, and it could have either been gotten by id or class...
[20:52:05] <patrick99e99> I want to store a reference to that element
[20:52:24] <patrick99e99> is there some unique identifier that I can get it by?
[20:52:28] <lolgolflol> I think you write  $("#selectleft option[value='"+value+"']")

[20:53:50] <lolgolflol> patrick99e99 : just a minute.
[20:53:59] <patrick99e99> I was hoping I could just do something like x = {}; x[el] = ...
[20:54:15] <patrick99e99> but the problem is, I cant do Object.keys(x).indexOf(el)
[20:54:19] <patrick99e99> because it becomes [Object Object]
[20:55:22] <lolgolflol> Can you debug on chrome and inspect object.
[20:56:11] <lolgolflol> patrick99e99 : Can you debug on chrome and inspect object.
[20:56:25] <patrick99e99> no its a string when you do Object.keys
[20:57:10] <patrick99e99> I read on the api that there is $.expando...  el.attr($.expando)
[20:57:16] <patrick99e99> but when I try it, it's undefined
[20:59:19] <lolgolflol> sorry I am not good english skill so I maybe difficult for understand and slow understand. I try help you.
[21:01:10] <lolgolflol> patrick99e99 : You try chrome tool and inspect http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/scripts.html.
[21:02:45] <lolgolflol> Do I right understand.

[21:05:26] <patrick99e99> that's my problem
[21:06:29] <lolgolflol> patrick99e99 just a minute
[21:08:56] <lolgolflol> you try inspect in chrome look Object.keys(obj)
[21:09:39] <lolgolflol> what is in object have element ?
[21:11:35] <lolgolflol> You have simple code in file and sent me. I inspect look element in object.
[21:12:22] <patrick99e99> lolgolflol: Object.keys(obj) does not have anything to inspect.. it's a string...
[21:12:25] <patrick99e99> lolgolflol: http://collinatorstudios.com/www/i_told_you_its_a_string.png
[21:15:38] <lolgolflol> just a minute
[21:24:24] <lolgolflol> Do you would like object as key ?
[21:25:12] <lolgolflol> so time call x[$(x)] , Do I true understand ?
[21:39:00] <lolgolflol> lolgolflol : I found problem , if you use object is key when you use  obj[el] = event_type;   new value instead old value.
[21:40:41] <lolgolflol> ><
[21:45:49] <lolgolflol> I think solve a problem so it is not best. you add variable  index_obj = {}  for keep key and obj ={} key
[21:45:49] <lolgolflol> ex :  obj[0] = event_type; index_obj[0] = el
[21:46:50] <lolgolflol> sorry as I little help for you
[21:51:09] <orentanay> How would I apply noconflict to the following function? (function($){/*jQuery stuff here*/})(jQuery); and will this interfear with any other jquery scripts on the page (I know there are other script, but nothing other than that.)?
[21:58:17] <orentanay> never mind, I did some more reading and answered my own question.
[22:08:52] <Onions> How can I make a cross-domain $.get?
[22:09:14] <Onions> Without editing the php
[22:10:25] <styol> Onions: may need to use $.ajax so you can specify crossDomain true
[22:10:41] <styol> er false
[22:11:16] * styol is probably wrong
[22:17:43] <asadpakistani> nested each are not working
[22:34:00] <destinydriven> how can I eliminate duplicate code from this jquery script http://jsfiddle.net/eJcS4/
[23:19:50] <rhandom2> At http://tinyurl.com/3rcedo2 I use the datepicker. It does not load properly. Pop-up loads, but no days show. Any ideas why?
[23:21:18] <rhandom2> I do get [13:20:27.057] reference to undefined property d.queue @ wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.6.1:18 but have no idea if that is a related error nor how to fix this
[23:53:31] <rhandom2> http://tinyurl.com/3rcedo2 has datepicker. It shows almost empty popup. Any ideas why guys?
