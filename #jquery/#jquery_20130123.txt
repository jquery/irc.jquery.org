[00:00:08] <anonymus> @cork: oh!  i duno how to add resources.
[00:00:20] <Qbix1>  many bugs happen becauseyou forget to TYPE new
[00:00:29] <Cork> anonymus: the images needs to point to a site that holds the image
[00:00:32] <Qbix1> so why would a library want to give you constructor functions
[00:00:36] <Qbix1> instead of say factories
[00:00:40] <Cork> anonymus: js and css can be added in the manager resources section
[00:00:52] <Qbix1> it would lead to more errors made by users of said library
[00:00:52] <Cork> (don't forget to select jquery in the dropdown)
[00:00:56] <Qbix1> jquery doesn't :)
[00:01:15] <Cork> anonymus: additionally don't include anything outside the body in the html section, and only js in the javascript section
[00:01:56] <anonymus> @cork: ohk..i added javascript/css
[00:02:27] <Cork> Qbix1: well the only difference between constructors and factories is that with factories you wrap the constructors in a function
[00:02:55] <Cork> and that means you get an additional scope that needs to be created for each call
[00:04:14] <marcules> Morning! :)
[00:05:49] <anonymus> @corkL in choose framework section: wt sud  i do?
[00:06:00] <anonymus> *@cork :
[00:06:20] <Cork> anonymus: select the jquery version you're using
[00:06:31] <Cork> most likely the 1.8 version
[00:06:36] <greek> Hey fellas. I have an input text field. When the user types something in it, I'd like to do something with the text via an Ajax call. On what event should I call the Ajax code - onkeyup? onchage? Not sure which is better / more efficient, but I'm worried about calling the Ajax event too often for each keypress. Thanks.
[00:06:39] <anonymus> i hv 1.9
[00:07:05] <Cork> anonymus: you're sure cycle supports 1.9 ?
[00:07:09] <anonymus> ohk.under tht..any checks ?
[00:07:17] <Cork> no
[00:07:18] <anonymus> how to ensure that?
[00:07:40] <marcules> greek, afaik onkeyup is also triggered when you type shift repeatedly
[00:07:43] <Cork> well 1.9 dropps quite a lot of old deprecated features
[00:08:01] <Cork> so if you haven't made sure it does; that might actually be why it isn't working for you
[00:08:05] <marcules> Fuck this is annoying
[00:08:18] <ravenzz> use jQuery Migrate
[00:08:39] <anonymus> @cork: ohk.. i have selected 1.8.3
[00:08:39] <Cork> ravenzz: that doesn't fix all of the problems with 1.9
[00:09:16] <ravenzz> I know but you know what has been deprecated at least
[00:09:33] <Cork> ravenzz: well ex. http://jsfiddle.net/6qhGz/
[00:09:46] <Cork> as far as i can see its not deprecated; but it doesn't work
[00:10:19] <greek> So is onchange better for calling an Ajax when capturing a change in a text field?
[00:10:40] <ravenzz> Cork mh? http://jsfiddle.net/6qhGz/1/
[00:10:57] <Cork> ravenzz: you just removed what the problem is
[00:11:04] <ravenzz> ok
[00:11:15] <Cork> the old one used global events, the new one use element event
[00:11:40] <anonymus> @cork: wt about no wrap (head)?
[00:11:58] <Cork> anonymus: if you're using dom ready use head
[00:12:10] <Cork> else use ondomready or onload
[00:12:38] <Cork> dom ready === $(document).ready() or $(function() {})
[00:12:38] <anonymus> ohk
[00:13:01] <greek> My thinking is to only call the Ajax method about 1 second after the user has stopped typing in the input field. That way it won't get called repeatedly while he's typing in a word
[00:13:21] <anonymus> how to add resources?
[00:13:26] <anonymus> askin sum url ?
[00:13:37] <Cork> anonymus: what type of resource?
[00:13:41] <Cork> images can't be added
[00:13:52] <anonymus> javaacript/css
[00:13:58] <Cork> manager resources
[00:14:10] <Cork> *manage resources
[00:14:34] <anonymus> for me its nt mentioned here
[00:14:41] <anonymus> i have add resources option
[00:14:45] <anonymus> visible
[00:14:59] <Cork> ah they might rename it when you actually add a resource
[00:15:06] <ravenzz> Cork I don't see any trigger method in the docs
[00:15:07] <Cork> just give the full url to the js/css file
[00:15:20] <anonymus> ohk
[00:15:20] <ravenzz> I never used global events though
[00:15:25] <Cork> ravenzz: its not fully documented
[00:15:32] <Cork> ravenzz: but its ex. what ajaxStart uses
[00:15:50] <ravenzz> I see
[00:15:50] <Cork> and ajaxStop/ajaxComplete and so on
[00:16:16] <Cork> haven't had time to try those event listeners, but as far as i can see they can't be working either
[00:16:43] <ravenzz> well maybe it is fine in such cases, but isn't it better to use global events as less as possible?
[00:17:16] <Cork> ravenzz: it triggers the listeners bound with the name you give
[00:17:21] <anonymus> @cork : by mistake i have added 1.9 version's jquery plugin
[00:17:23] <anonymus> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js
[00:17:28] <Cork> ravenzz: it doens't care about what element its bound on
[00:17:33] <ravenzz> k
[00:17:39] <ravenzz> I got this
[00:17:55] <anonymus> other thing i have added is : cycle plugin: jquery.cycle.all.min.js
[00:18:01] <Cork> ravenzz: and its what i need cause i want to push info to things that is added dynamically; and i want there listers to be removed when the html is
[00:18:17] <ravenzz> and it is awesome... but if you know the actual element/s I think is better to trigger to that one
[00:18:23] <Cork> ravenzz: thats why global event listeners was souch a good match
[00:18:32] <trinadh> anonymus: http://jsfiddle.net/trinadh/9dQqU/6/ , check the settings of the fiddle as well
[00:18:33] <Cork> ravenzz: i don't
[00:19:10] <Cork> ravenzz: this is a websocket liberary i start when the page loads, and when ajax calls change the page they bind listeners for the type of message they'r interested in
[00:19:13] <ravenzz> why? because you of  the event.target ?
[00:19:15] <Cork> and they get it as events
[00:19:45] <ravenzz> -you
[00:20:17] <Cork> ravenzz: $container.html().on('se:section_i_want', function(event, messages) { alert(message + ' was reserved'); });
[00:20:43] <Cork> and when you want to clean up you just do $container.html('').off()
[00:21:14] <anonymus> @trinadh: ty for info
[00:21:17] <ravenzz> yeah make sense
[00:21:22] <anonymus> now  i understud
[00:21:30] <Cork> and its actually faster then doing $('element') cause it doens't involve the dom at all when you trigger it
[00:21:54] <Cork> cause it just looks in the event data array in jquery and call each callback function
[00:22:04] <Cork> no element lookup needed
[00:22:09] <ravenzz> yeah
[00:22:42] <ravenzz> well anyway I think that it creates the jQuery objects for the target elements at least, doesn't it?
[00:22:57] <Cork> ya
[00:25:08] <anonymus> now see  this:  http://jsfiddle.net/karanJ/s4dxn/
[00:25:15] <anonymus> @cork
[00:25:19] <anonymus> @trinadh
[00:26:13] <the_kick> i was wondering if anyone knew any good plugin tutorials, hopefully with syntax explanations
[00:26:41] <the_kick> im watching tuts+ one by Dan Wellman, but anything else is a bonus
[00:26:58] <Cork> anonymus: you need to provice a link to the cycle library
[00:27:07] <Cork> anonymus: jsfiddle doesn't host it
[00:28:29] <anonymus> @cork: yeh..worked now..
[00:28:55] <anonymus> check now: http://jsfiddle.net/karanJ/s4dxn/
[00:30:12] <anonymus> now i want to  execute thru my localhost using  php files
[00:30:41] <Cork> anonymus: you still don't inlcude the cycle library
[00:30:50] <Cork> or you didn't click update
[00:30:56] <jeremy-> I'm trying to pass a parameter using jquery. It works if i use the jquery selector $('#example tr').live('click', function() { ....then access it using this .... but doesnt work if i use a child selector and go for the parent tr using var ctr = $(this).closest("tr") ..... and access it using ctr....
[00:31:09] <Cork> jeremy-: don't use live
[00:31:17] <jeremy-> I have to because its dynamic from 'datatables'
[00:31:20] <Cork> its deprecated and removed in 1.9
[00:31:22] <kuter> how to put result from into i.e. <input id="result" name="result" />, now i have $("#sum").html(sum.toFixed(2)); and it works fine with <span id="sum" /> but i need to put the result into input
[00:31:23] <jeremy-> oh
[00:31:25] <jeremy-> whats the alternative?
[00:31:32] <Cork> jeremy-: use delegate or on
[00:31:36] <Cork> see the .live page
[00:31:38] <jeremy-> i see, thanks
[00:31:50] <anonymus> oh!! yeh i dint click update

[00:32:32] <Cork> anonymus: you didn't remove the old broken link; but ya :)
[00:32:40] <Cork> anonymus: so whats the question?
[00:32:42] <anonymus> how to remove old one?
[00:32:56] <Cork> the little x button on the right of the link in resources
[00:33:18] <Cork> it doesn't really matter though its just a 404 error line
[00:33:28] <anonymus> yeh .. am done now
[00:33:36] <Cork> anonymus: so whats the question? <--
[00:33:42] <anonymus> @ cork: now  i would like to execute this in my localhost
[00:34:06] <Cork> as long as you make sure you load the librarys you need it should just work as far as i can tell
[00:34:13] <anonymus> by placing code in file with .php extension
[00:34:15] <Cork> make sure the js files exist
[00:34:37] <anonymus> ohk.
[00:34:41] <Cork> anonymus: js doens't care if you use php, as long as the php generate valid html
[00:34:46] <anonymus> whr  sud  i place dom object  in my file
[00:34:55] <Cork> php run server side, and html is sent to the client, js runs on the client side
[00:36:53] <anonymus> am place jquery code  in seperate file with .js extension
[00:37:03] <anonymus> and including in main php file
[00:40:24] <Randomage> Allright. I tried not asking people for help, but I can't do it apparently. How the heck can I animate background position?
[00:40:40] <Cork> Randomage: you need a plugin
[00:40:55] <Randomage> Can you recommend one that isn't outdated?
[00:41:01] <Randomage> I tried one but I get an error.
[00:46:43] <Cork> Randomage: can't find any plugin off hand right now
[00:46:48] <anonymus> @cork : tyyy soo much!!
[00:47:00] <anonymus> i got it even in my localhost
[00:47:12] <Cork> Randomage: shouldn't be too hard to write one you're self though
[00:47:54] <Cork> Randomage: http://benknowscode.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/extending-jquery-animate-beyond-basic-css-animation/
[00:48:23] <marcules> Wouldn't it be possible to animate background-position-x and background-position-y simultaneously?
[00:48:33] <Randomage> It is in some browsers.
[00:48:37] <Cork> not supported in all browsers as far as i know
[00:48:38] <anonymus> @cork: still one doubt left. can i ?
[00:48:43] <marcules> And by that you mean IE?
[00:48:44] <marcules> :D
[00:48:53] <Randomage> Opera is failing too afaik.
[00:49:02] <marcules> hmpf
[00:49:11] <Cork> i don't think gecko supports background-position-* but i might remember wrong
[00:49:38] <Cork> i actually think its ie that first supported background-position-*
[00:50:08] <marcules> I know, that khtml supports it for some time now
[00:51:11] <Cork> http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/CSS.field.background-position-x.html
[00:51:31] <Cork> webkit and trident is the only ones that support it
[00:51:42] <Cork> webkit ~= khtml :)
[00:52:06] <Cork> webkit is based of khtml, and most of the khtml users has switched to webkit anyway
[00:52:50] <marcules> Cork, I always say khtml when I whink webkit for some reason :D
[00:52:56] <marcules> *think
[00:53:11] <anonymus> @cork : i created my webpage. in tht this slideshow sud  appear in my webpage .
[00:54:12] <Cork> (and if anyone doesn't know trident == ie)
[00:54:15] <marcules> Randomage, well I guess then you would have to write your own plugin animating it simultaneously in background-position, like Cork suggested
[00:54:30] <trinadh> how about css3 transitions or keyframes with a fallback to background-position-* for ie
[00:54:49] <Cork> that would work, but it would break on all ie browsers except ie10
[00:55:02] <Cork> (but sure about ie10 actually)
[00:55:40] <trinadh> yes it would break in ie9 and less
[00:56:19] <Cork> though its not hard to make the animation work with a plugin
[00:56:58] <Cork> oh, interesting http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/issues/9
[00:58:14] <anonymus> cork plzzz
[00:58:17] <anonymus> one moree doubtt
[00:58:22] <anonymus> clear tht too
[00:58:47] <Cork> anonymus: haven't seen any question to answer
[01:00:45] <Cork> hmm http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2004Aug/0205.html sounds like a really good idea; pitty they didn't do that yet >_>
[01:00:58] <lombrozo> Why does my simple XML to HTML (via XSL) only show "hello world" alert in FireFox but not in IE: http://www.lombrozo.co.uk/test/Simple.xml
[01:01:34] <Cork> lombrozo: if you can't reproduce it in a simple html page the question belongs in a xsl channel not here
[01:02:00] <DreamWork> good morning
[01:02:15] <Cork> might be something like ie not enabling "acrive scripting" on xsl pages or something
[01:02:18] <Cork> but i wouldn't know
[01:02:25] <DreamWork> the jquery templating, is this in core or in a plugin ?
[01:02:38] <lombrozo> Cork - cool, will try a XSL room, thanks
[01:02:44] <Cork> Dreamer3: jquery.tmpl has been depricated
[01:03:02] <Cork> i would suggest looking at jqote2
[01:06:05] <lucasbonomi> Hi ! i have a little issue with a simple jquery event..
[01:06:48] <DreamWork> other ideas with jquery and templating ? ;)
[01:08:59] <Cork> DreamWork: would you happen to beable to be a bit more specific with that question?
[01:09:10] <Cork> lucasbonomi: just ask the question if you want help
[01:10:09] <DreamWork> is jqote2 the only one templating with jquery ?
[01:10:14] <Cork> nope
[01:10:35] <Cork> you have a few mentioned here http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[01:10:39] <Cork> and there is more
[01:11:43] <Cork> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41375604/Template-Comparison
[01:14:54] <anonymus> @cork: sry.connnection has been lost.
[01:15:17] <Cork> anonymus: haven't seen any question to answer <--
[01:15:47] <anonymus> hmm.
[01:16:04] <anonymus> In my webpage  i have included  this slideshow. its working
[01:16:36] <anonymus> in the bottom when am trying to include slideup and slidedown panel..this slideshow is not getting displayed
[01:16:56] <Cork> need a fiddle again
[01:17:50] <anonymus> ok ..
[01:17:55] <anonymus> 2 minz
[01:18:15] <iman> how  can I check undefined in a if ?
[01:18:21] <iman> == not works
[01:19:54] <thirdender> iman: ===
[01:20:23] <iman> thirdender: and !== for not equal?
[01:20:31] <thirdender> iman: yep :-p
[01:21:01] <iman> thirdender:  SyntaxError: unterminated string literal Break On This Error] 	if(id !== 'undefined")
[01:21:23] <thirdender> iman: you have a single and a double quote... also, undefined shouldn't be in quotes (it's a Javascript literal)
[01:21:43] <NodeX> !== means type and match
[01:21:46] <thirdender> just if (id !== undefined)
[01:21:50] <NodeX> (both have to be equal)
[01:21:55] <Kingsy> this is gonna sound like a really dumb question, but say I have a function that returns a url of a file.. how do you offer that URL for download int he browser?
[01:22:29] <NodeX> Kingsy, file downloads are something that has to be initiated by the server
[01:22:35] <NodeX> browser first then server
[01:22:38] <thirdender> Kingsy: imho, best way is to already have a link/button in the DOM that's hidden by default... then assign your URL to that link HREF and show the link
[01:22:45] <iman> but i got last error again, ReferenceError: id is not defined [Break On This Error] 	f(id !== undefined)
[01:22:54] <iman> but i got last error again, ReferenceError: id is not defined [Break On This Error] if(id !== undefined)
[01:23:10] <thirdender> iman: can you post more of your code on http://jsfiddle.net/ ?
[01:23:15] <iman> sure
[01:23:26] <NodeX> if(typeof(id)!=='undefined')  .... maybe?
[01:23:32] <anonymus> @cork: see this: http://jsfiddle.net/karanJ/FfusY/
[01:23:54] <Haprog> Kingsy: window.location = my_file_url;
[01:24:02] <Kingsy> Haprog: thanks
[01:24:22] <Kingsy> I assumed you could just point the browser to it or something along those lines.
[01:24:27] <iman> thirdender: http://jsfiddle.net/8e8CW/
[01:24:32] <thirdender> iman: ah yeah, probably what NodeX said
[01:24:48] <Haprog> Kingsy: yeah, it's the same as redirecting to another address ny JS
[01:25:06] <thirdender> iman: oh, nm... you have trId as the variable on one line, then you try the variable id on the next line
[01:25:23] <iman> woooooow
[01:25:26] <Haprog> Kingsy: you will stay on the current page though if the server returns header "Content-Disposition: attachment" which forces a download usually.
[01:25:26] <iman> big mistake
[01:25:34] <thirdender> iman: change your if statements to trId !== undefined and see if that fixes it... :-p There's a second if lower down as well
[01:26:32] <iman> thirdender: ReferenceError: trId is not defined [Break On This Error] if(trId !== undefined)
[01:26:55] <sahbeewah> no you can't check undefined variables like that...
[01:27:13] <sahbeewah> as was mentioned... typeof trId !== 'undefined'
[01:27:15] <Kingsy> yeah exactly what I need
[01:27:19] <Kingsy> Haprog: thanks
[01:27:26] <Kingsy> thirdender: NodeX thanks for the info
[01:28:08] <anonymus> @cork :  did u find?
[01:28:12] <iman> in works correctly , if(trId === undefined)
[01:28:21] <iman> maybe there aren't anything such as !==
[01:28:21] <Anna30F> ____________Hello __________
[01:28:39] <Kingsy> Haprog: hrm damn, thats not what I wanted. its a pdf see, so its loading the stupid browse plugin.
[01:28:41] <thirdender> sahbeewah: read the code he posted... if you did that test, he'd never see that he used the wrong variable name :-p variable !== undefined works fine if you've already set a variable value
[01:29:01] <Kingsy> I could do it at a php level.. but I don't know how
[01:29:05] <Haprog> Kingsy: it depends on the browser configuration then. not much you can do.
[01:29:52] <Haprog> Kingsy: well if the file is on a server you control you can try to configure the server (Apache with .htaccess file for example) to always send the "Content-Disposition: attachment" header with PDF files.
[01:29:59] <thirdender> iman: there are a few other issues with the structure of your code... what is the second function() { ... } portion supposed to do?
[01:30:18] <Haprog> Kingsy: or if you send the file through a PHP file which sets that header first.
[01:30:50] <thirdender> iman: oh wait, I see... it's a hover callback
[01:31:00] <Cork> anonymus: looks like a z-index bug
[01:31:10] <iman> thirdender: it's a hover function, first function open a div to show a message and second function closes what first one opens
[01:31:18] <anonymus> @cork: meanz?
[01:31:28] <Cork> anonymus: make sure your form isn't slideing above the #flip element
[01:31:44] <Haprog> Kingsy: then you'd need to use the something like "http://myhost.com/download.php?file=myfile.pdf" as the url for downloading and have the PHP file output the pdf file contents along with the correct headers.
[01:31:47] <Cork> by giveing the #flip a higher z-index value then the form has
[01:32:27] <anonymus> oh!
[01:32:41] <thirdender> iman: you define trId in one function, but not the other... the variable trId ceases to exist after the first function
[01:33:18] <anonymus> where to make change for that?
[01:33:21] <Haprog> Kingsy: you would need a PHP file that does simething like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7263923/how-to-force-file-download-with-php
[01:33:29] <Haprog> *something
[01:33:58] <Kingsy> great..
[01:34:05] <Kingsy> Haprog: thanks for the help.
[01:34:44] <iman> dear thirdender thanks a lot, i change this like http://jsfiddle.net/8e8CW/1/ and it works, thank you for putting  time
[01:35:28] <anonymus> @cork: am forcing to scroll down to access tht flip .
[01:35:32] <thirdender> iman: okay cool :-p I was just about to send http://jsfiddle.net/thirdender/8e8CW/2/ ... the other way you can do it (depending on your goal) is to move the variable declaration outside the scope of the first callback function... that way the variable value persists even after that function ends
[01:35:49] <Cork> anonymus: in what browser?
[01:35:58] <Nebros> ist there any one with know how in ajax and django? ^^
[01:36:01] <iman> thirdender: you mean, declare a global variable, yes, it's ture
[01:36:14] <Cork> anonymus: ah sorry forgot i did that ;P
[01:36:17] <anonymus> @cork: sorry.it is forcing me to scroll down to access tht flip .
[01:36:47] <anonymus> @cork:  wt yu hv done?
[01:36:55] <anonymus> am using chrome
[01:36:55] <thirdender> thirdender: yeah, it doesn't have to be a global variable... just outside the closure of the first callback. If it's inside another closure (say, the $(document).ready callback) then it won't be "global"... it will only exist as far as that closure
[01:37:20] <Cork> anonymus: so #flit { position: fixed; bottom: 0px; } instead of margin-top
[01:37:39] <anonymus> @cork : let me try nd tell u.
[01:37:41] <Cork> anonymus: no i forgot that i needed to scroll down :)
[01:37:51] <Cork> thats what i meant "forgot i did that" ^^'
[01:38:05] <anonymus> :)
[01:39:56] <anonymus> @cork : tht space has gone but shifted to top of page.
[01:40:00] <anonymus> see this: http://jsfiddle.net/karanJ/FfusY/5/
[01:40:21] <anonymus> I need it to be @bottom of the page
[01:40:55] <Cork> anonymus: s/#flit/flip/
[01:41:03] <Cork> anonymus: * s/#flit/#flip/
[01:41:33] <anonymus> @cork: itz a typo mistake.
[01:41:37] <anonymus> itz jst a flip
[01:41:43] <Cork> anonymus: thats what i meant
[01:41:51] <Cork> and thats why the element is in the wrong place
[01:42:20] <anonymus> see now: http://jsfiddle.net/karanJ/FfusY/6/
[01:43:15] <anonymus> @cork: the size of lfip has been changed.

[01:43:21] <discorpia> what is the correct way to bind events to links in jquery mobile? i get strange behavior. if i use .on() in my pageinit it works on first pageload but not on the following pages (loading by ajax), and if i use .live() it adds the same handler once every pageload, meaning i get multiple triggered when clicking
[01:43:24] <anonymus> *flip
[01:43:31] <Cork> anonymus: left: 0px; right: 0px;
[01:43:56] <anonymus> ok
[01:44:34] <anonymus> @cork: hey yup!! got it..
[01:44:45] <anonymus> check : http://jsfiddle.net/karanJ/FfusY/8/
[01:46:27] <anonymus> now i will try this in my localhost .
[01:46:58] <Cork> anonymus: if you want to get rid of the flickering you need to replace the padding on the animated element
[01:47:50] <anonymus> ohh!

[01:48:19] <Kingsy> Haprog: screw it, I will just insert a link with js
[01:48:26] <Haprog> :D
[01:49:04] <Kingsy> Haprog: when you isnert a link wiht js, if you click it the browser will open it right? can you set it for download with js only if its a href?
[01:49:44] <anonymus> @tyy!!yourz lukz gud .
[01:49:46] <Haprog> Kingsy: I don't think so. Only thing you can do with a link is right click and Save As.
[01:50:01] <Haprog> as opposed to just opening the url
[02:01:00] <anonymus> @cork: i got it..
[02:01:20] <anonymus> but dunno why this slideshow file is getting effected.
[02:01:44] <anonymus> upon including panel file
[02:03:56] <anonymus> @cork: where sud  i include this file in main index.php file toget in my webpage?
[02:04:35] <Cork> that depends on what you're php file does
[02:04:45] <Cork> and that sounds like a question for ##php
[02:05:45] <anonymus> hmmm.ok.
[02:06:10] <discorpia> no suggestion on how to bind focus/blur events in jqm so they only get attached once but remain in place for subsequent page loads? is there another function except for pageinit that's meant for things that should only run once
[02:12:11] <anonymus> @cork: ty so much for all the help! bye.
[02:19:12] <anonymus> how to go into php channel  in freenode

[02:20:08] <anonymus> where sud type tht
[02:20:39] <Cork> in your client
[02:20:42] <beancurd> type /join #php
[02:20:45] <Cork> check the status window
[02:20:58] <Cork> its ##php not #php; and like i said the nick needs to be registered
[02:21:05] <beancurd> oh.. and what Cork said if you're not registered.
[02:21:11] <Trisox> hey cork
[02:21:15] <Cork> o/
[02:21:21] <Trisox> did you see the msg i send you yesterday
[02:21:31] <Cork> don't think so >_>
[02:21:32] <beancurd> disregard my comments.. listen to the Cork
[02:21:38] <Trisox> hmm
[02:21:41] <anonymus> ok..
[02:22:12] <Trisox> Cork
[02:22:12] <Trisox> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12739
[02:23:18] <anonymus> i got register instructions
[02:23:32] <Cork> Trisox: that bug is about namespaces
[02:23:39] <Cork> and its for 1.8 not 1.9
[02:23:45] <Trisox> oh ok
[02:23:49] <anonymus> when i did , got a msg saying..cant use this command in tihs window
[02:23:53] <Trisox> right
[02:23:57] <anonymus> whr sud  i type tht ?
[02:24:02] <Cork> uh scratch the last part
[02:24:06] <Cork> it was for 1.9 >_>
[02:24:16] <Trisox> well...
[02:24:19] <Cork> but it looks like they made a broad fix that fails >_>
[02:24:41] <Trisox> i though this looks bit like what you had going on
[02:24:51] <Cork> wonder if that was what broke normal unspaced events...
[02:25:15] <Trisox> i hope not :)
[02:25:21] <Cork> Trisox: its about namespace.event triggering all namespace. events
[02:25:34] <Cork> not about it triggering all namespae.event events on the page
[02:25:55] <Cork> so its very different
[02:26:03] <Cork> but it might be what caused it
[02:26:14] <Trisox> hmm then i miss read i supose
[02:26:49] <Cork> Trisox: see the dot in the event string
[02:30:35] <anonymus> @cork : do u come daily here?
[02:30:54] <Cork> more or less

[02:35:00] <anonymus> ok
[02:35:13] <anonymus> i cant register  :9
[02:35:19] <anonymus> :(
[02:35:24] <Cork> can't ??
[02:36:00] <anonymus> yup
[02:36:22] <Cork> define "can't register"
[02:36:43] <alexandernst_> I just noticed that the browser stops triggering mouse-move events when the mouse is not hovering the browser window. E.g. go here http://jqueryui.com/resizable/ , resize the window (height) until the demo area is cut in half. Start resizing the div and go down with the mouse until you're outside the browser area. You'll see that the div stopped changin it's size even if you haven't released the mouse and you're moving it.
[02:36:45] <alexandernst_> Why?
[02:37:28] <Cork> alexandernst_: mouse events are limited to the viewport
[02:37:56] <Cork> html doesn't have a way to capture the mouse event like you normally do in native programs
[02:38:00] <anonymus> typed like this : /msg NickServ REGISTER bar foo@bar.com
[02:38:08] <anonymus> with my values
[02:38:19] <anonymus> said anonymus already registered
[02:38:19] <Cork> sure, but what didn't work?
[02:38:23] <Cork> ah
[02:38:25] <alexandernst_> Cork: I understand, thank you
[02:38:32] <Cork> anonymus: so you need to use another nick
[02:38:40] <anonymus> nd i dint get any mail
[02:38:50] <anonymus> tried
[02:39:01] <Cork> ya, cause your nick is already owned by someone else
[02:39:24] <Cork> try /nick <another nick> until you find one thats free
[02:39:47] <Cork> nickserv will tell you in the status window if the nick is taken
[02:39:51] <anonymus> ok

[02:57:52] <the_kick> must be cos the plugins not returning the original element? but line 47 looks ok

[02:58:33] <the_kick> fixed :P
[03:07:27] <kuter> i'm using jquery.validate.js .. it works only if i click submit button is there any possibily to validate after button click ?
[03:07:39] <kuter> how to validate by calling function ?
[03:07:59] <kuter> sorry for asking, i'm new in jquery ..
[03:20:40] <Cork> kuter: you can ask the plugin to validate manually
[03:21:24] <Cork> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/valid
[03:22:10] <Cork> or http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/form if you prefer that
[03:25:47] <Anes> need a simple jquery help pls roommates
[03:26:56] <Cork> Anes: just ask the question, don't make ppl as what you want to ask about for them to get to know what you want to ask about
[03:27:13] <Cork> *ppl ask what you
[03:29:35] <kuter> Cork: thanks, it works.
[03:30:10] <caddoo> Is there a built in method in jQuery to get the text inside the selected option in a select form element?
[03:30:51] <Cork> $('#select option[name="value"]').text()
[03:31:11] <Cork> ah the selected option
[03:31:33] <caddoo> ah i can use that anyway
[03:31:39] <caddoo> just set value= instead
[03:31:40] <caddoo> thanks
[03:31:54] <Cork> var select = $('#select'); select.find('option[value="' + select.val() +'"]').text()
[03:31:58] <Cork> so that should work
[03:32:30] <Cork> ya name was a typo
[03:35:22] <milligan> How can I find an element by id from parent() ?
[03:36:27] <Cork> $('#id')
[03:36:36] <Cork> there is no need to go relative to find an id
[03:36:44] <Cork> it HAS TO always be uniq on the page
[03:36:49] <milligan> How about by class?
[03:37:00] <Cork> .closest('.my-class')
[03:40:00] <milligan> So this should work, $(sender).parent().closest('.details').options.length , when sender is a <select> ?
[03:42:33] <Krisostoomus> whats jquery address?
[03:42:40] <Krisostoomus> please i need it
[03:42:53] <milligan> http://jquery.com/
[03:43:23] <Cork> milligan: you don't need parnet()
[03:43:34] <Cork> milligan: closest is used instead of .parent
[03:43:59] <milligan> Cork, the item I am looking for is contained within the same element as the selector...
[03:44:14] <Cork> so sibling?
[03:44:51] <milligan> object has no method sibling.. ?
[03:45:11] <Cork> sounds like what you want is $(sender).sibling('.details')
[03:45:27] <Cork> or .nextAll or .prevAll depending on the structure
[03:45:43] <Cork> *$(sender).siblings('.details')
[03:46:21] <Cork> or if its always the next in the page; you might get away with just using .next()
[03:46:53] <Cork> milligan: i would need the html structure around these elements to be able to answer more precisely
[03:47:54] <milligan> I'm close... Gettng Cannot set property 'length' of undefined. So I guess it's not finding the elements. Let me pastebin the structure.
[03:48:14] <Cork> no you wouldn't ever get undefined
[03:48:31] <Cork> not from jquery at least
[03:48:56] <shadow_fox> can someone suggest me a full width responsive slider + fluid also
[03:49:23] <milligan> Cork, http://pastebin.com/BKEnasji . As you can see, my "system" element has an onChange, and it will try to update the details elements. At least that is what I want.
[03:49:57] <Cork> ugg .net...
[03:51:01] <Cork> milligan: i really don't see what that has to do with jquery
[03:51:19] <Cork> all those calls happen on page load, not client side
[03:52:12] <milligan> oooo, I think I know what is wrong.
[03:52:35] <milligan> I am using the elements provided in the function, inside a $.get() .. but that object isn't available in there, naturally.
[03:53:47] <milligan> Cork, http://pastebin.com/pNth9mZD .. Any easy way of making "sender" available inside the $.get function ?
[03:54:13] <Nebros> i have there a little problem... I have created a webpage with django and tryed to implement ajax. on my page are five tables and they have to load step by step. but now, the table have only the text "Loading..." on it, but its not loading. is there anyone with know how in ajax + django?
[03:55:21] <jayant__> i am doing an ajax query to populate data in dhtmlxgrid, but when i do  back button on the browser and land on the page the ajax query doesnt work
[03:55:27] <jayant__> unless i refresh the page
[03:55:44] <Cork> milligan: it all thats inside a js file, it should work just fine
[03:56:04] <Cork> milligan: the sender will be inherited in the $.get function scope from its parent
[03:56:31] <Cork> but the problem is .options
[03:56:43] <Cork> there is no souch value
[03:57:22] <Cork> milligan: $(sender).siblings('.details').children().length
[03:57:48] <Cork> and you can't do length = 0
[03:58:14] <milligan> $(sender).siblings('.details').children().length = 0
[03:58:18] <Cork> milligan: so even better $(sender).siblings('.details').empty()
[03:58:40] <Cork> milligan: that will only change the length of the jquery array
[03:58:46] <Cork> not remove actual dom elements
[03:59:11] <jayant__> i got a list of items, when i select the item an ajax query is executed populating the data of the table. It works fine. But when i go to another page and come back to the previous page using the browser back button the ajax query does not execute on selection of the same item untill i select another item or refresh the page
[03:59:28] <milligan> Cork, No, I meant that that call returned 0 .. so it doesn't seem like it's finding any siblings?
[03:59:31] <jayant__> plz help
[04:00:03] <milligan> hold on .. I might be brainfarting a bit..
[04:02:00] <Cork> milligan: $(sender).length > 0 ?
[04:04:41] <milligan> Cork, $(sender).parent().siblings().children('.details') did the trick. I forgot that the elements were packed in each their <td>
[04:05:17] * Cork nods
[04:06:01] <Cork> you could prob do $(sender).parent().find('.details') to make it a bit cleaner
[04:07:07] <milligan> Got it working now :) Thanks budd
[04:19:01] <patie> what is my and at in jqueryui tooltip position ??
[04:19:24] <patie> new design looks good but better doc is needed....
[04:26:51] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. Isn't is possible to load some javascript WITH an ajax page? Let's say I have a button with a link to sometest.html, and that is loaded via ajax. But if I have a <script></script> block in the bottom of sometest.html it is not transmitted with the content?
[04:27:28] <jaffipaffi> Let's say I have a button on sometest.html with onclick="dosomething();" and in the bottom I have <script>function dosomething(){ alert('test'); }</script> - then the function isn't working
[04:31:54] <imgrey> hello #jquery
[04:32:54] <imgrey> can someone suggest a way to switch content, show in certain div with swipeleft and swiperight actions ?
[04:33:21] <jaffipaffi> Is it really true that I can't load special utility scripts per page with jquery mobile? This is pretty basic functionality that should be documented
[04:52:07] <Nebros> is there someone with knowhow in django + ajax?
[04:52:15] <Randomage> I was reading about css hooks, I was wondering tho, are there any default one installed?
[05:08:21] <jacta> How can I toggle next-nearest ul to visible on click in radiobutton
[05:17:23] <jacta> Can anyone help with http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/1/ - I think im pretty lost here :p
[05:22:11] <jacta> its really dead in here today :\
[05:24:21] <jacta> hi?
[05:28:37] <cuddle`> hello I have a weird problem where jQuery returns zero elements with an ID selector, but wrapping a getelementbyid inside the query object does return the element
[05:28:58] <cuddle`> like $('#foo') vs $(document.getElementById('foo'))
[05:38:04] <Nebros> only questions, but no answers today...
[05:43:47] <nFFF> jacta, next is wrong
[05:44:21] <nFFF> your ul is not a sibling of the input
[05:45:32] <nFFF> jaffipaffi, why would you ever dunamically add javascript to the dom? :<
[05:46:29] <jacta> nFFF, but then how to find? I want to toggle the display of next ul and close when another is selected
[05:46:32] <jacta> u understand?
[05:46:36] <nFFF> yes
[05:47:27] <nFFF> but as I said your transversing of the DOM tree is incorrect
[05:47:35] <Cork> Trisox, : http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12989
[05:47:36] <nFFF> look at where you input is in relation to the UL you want
[05:48:04] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/2/
[05:48:07] <jacta> input is just before the ul?
[05:48:21] <nFFF> it's not
[05:48:29] <nFFF> its embedded within multiple elements
[05:48:50] <nFFF> the table is next to the UL
[05:48:56] <nFFF> and the input is within the table
[05:49:04] <jacta> smart, I think I get why now, but is it possible to add the toggle as I want, its not the correct way yet. aaah
[05:53:03] <aro> is there a plugin to open a new window with code snippets in
[05:59:42] <jacta> is it to much, nFFF ?
[06:01:16] <Nebros> is there one with skill in jquery and django? ^^
[06:10:03] <Nebros> i search on with skill in django + ajax...
[06:12:49] <nFFF> Nebros, ask questions speicifc to jQuery
[06:12:55] <nFFF> and then goto django channel and ask their questions
[06:18:20] <jacta> nFFF, are you still there?
[06:18:36] <Nebros> django channel is blocked
[06:19:11] <Nebros> and its one question for both parts together... :D
[06:25:31] <Trisox> ah Cork
[06:25:32] <Trisox> :D
[06:28:09] <Cork> Trisox: now the big question is; are they planing to remove $.cache
[06:28:12] <Cork> :)
[06:28:37] <Cork> i kinda supect they are, and if they do my schema collapses :/
[06:28:58] <Trisox> :|
[06:29:08] <Trisox> use older version then
[06:29:15] <Cork> na
[06:29:20] <Trisox> ok
[06:29:30] <Cork> i can get it working in 2.0 with 8 lines of code
[06:29:40] <Cork> the problem is; i don't know if it will keep working
[06:29:49] <Trisox> hmm
[06:29:52] <Cork> or if i'm painting my self into a corner >_>
[06:29:58] <Trisox> well 2.0 aint final yet
[06:30:20] <Trisox> paining the floor :D
[06:30:39] <Cork> well i actually don't really care about 2.0 its more like 2.3 or 2.4 that scares me
[06:30:52] <Trisox> hmm
[06:31:06] <Trisox> well thats like 1.3.2 and 1.9
[06:31:23] <Cork> cause that would be far ahead in time to be when the site i'm working on will have started to be a bit stale
[06:31:55] <Cork> and it would REALLY suck to have to rewrite the event core on it then cause jquery throw out $.cache[].event[].elm
[06:31:58] <Trisox> keep updating with every version
[06:32:31] <Trisox> what are you building any who?
[06:32:36] <Cork> if that elm variable is dropped the entire schema breaks
[06:32:51] <Cork> its a wrapper lib for a websocket connection
[06:33:01] <Trisox> ah
[06:33:11] <Cork> that lets pushes the messages from the socket out on event handlers
[06:33:15] <Cork> with filters in the name
[06:33:39] <Trisox> i see
[06:33:46] <Cork> ex: on('se:new-message', function(e, message) {})
[06:33:49] <Trisox> well isnt that always with plugins?
[06:34:01] <Cork> what do you mean?
[06:34:17] <Trisox> that version changes makes stuff break ect
[06:35:00] <Trisox> you can always wrap jquery in the wrapper :p
[06:35:10] <Trisox> lol
[06:35:39] <Cork> well i used jquery global events cause i didn't want to have to track if elements was removed from the dom
[06:36:22] <Cork> as jquery does this already i piggybacked on it so when an element was removed, my callback listener for that element was removed too
[06:37:49] <Cork> and if i where to wrap it up in a plugin i would have to track all events added through jquery and keep a cache that i update when elements are replaced/removed and so on
[06:37:57] <Cork> and that can become really harry
[06:38:00] <Cork> *hairy
[06:39:49] <dashavoo> after creating a datepicker I am calling $(".hasDatepicker>div").css("width", "");, but when I interact with it the width attribute comes back - how can I stop that?
[06:40:27] <Cork> dashavoo: you most likely can't
[06:40:48] <Cork> dashavoo: you could use a class that you add and in it have width: auto !important;
[06:40:51] <Cork> that MIGHT work
[06:41:52] <Kunda> can someone tell me how to fix this jQuery "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL" (http://i.imgur.com/rVF2Nhs.jpg) ? Thanks!
[06:42:24] <dashavoo> Cork: it doesn't
[06:42:33] <dashavoo> I tried that first
[06:42:37] <jrajav> Kunda: It would seem that you have an unexpected illegal token.
[06:42:40] <jrajav> *ding* next!
[06:43:08] <Rchristiani> Kunda: probably because of the #&038;
[06:43:13] <seutje> Kunda: don't copy/paste code
[06:43:20] <Cork> Kunda: when you get errors like that from the jquery lib it most always is from what you used to call it
[06:43:31] <seutje> oh wait, wtf pound?
[06:43:54] <Kunda> looking up that character now
[06:43:57] <jrajav> Kunda: You have an issue with your Javascript being html encoded.
[06:44:19] <Cork> :)
[06:44:21] <seutje> looks like the "&&" got escaped
[06:44:37] <Kunda> oh i see
[06:44:37] <Cork> dashavoo: you mean the class is removed too?
[06:45:14] <seutje> you copy/pasted it from some website, didn't u? :P
[06:45:27] <Rchristiani> That's what I am thinking!
[06:45:42] <Kunda> i'm not sure..but most likely
[06:46:33] <shadow_fox> Hi, I need help in this. I have this bounce effect but its not smooth. check here http://jsfiddle.net/UqFfJ/
[06:46:42] <shadow_fox> please advice me what should i do ?
[06:46:43] <Trisox> Cork:  remove() function does this also right
[06:47:05] <Cork> Trisox: as long as the cache is kept ya
[06:47:10] <Trisox> i mean it removes any left overs
[06:47:24] <Cork> Trisox: but if they choose to just relay on the underlying dom, it won't
[06:47:43] <Cork> they could basically remove the entire $.cache object
[06:47:45] <Trisox> well they cant remove the remove()
[06:47:49] <Cork> and i would be a sitting duck :)
[06:47:57] <cerberos> is there a way to get details of ajax request in a .done() callback?
[06:48:09] <Cork> Trisox: if remove only calls the native removeNode it won't help me
[06:48:31] <fRAiLtY-> Why does this work: http://pastie.org/5837104 (but it's ugly and old) and this doesn't: http://pastie.org/5837039
[06:48:34] <Trisox> well they would need something to remove eventhandlers
[06:48:45] <Trisox> removing from the dom is not good enought
[06:48:46] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to convert an old script to query to tidy it up a bit
[06:48:47] <Trisox> -t
[06:49:25] <Trisox> cork same goes if there would remove off() :p
[06:49:39] <Trisox> bit far stretched but...
[06:50:58] <Cork> Trisox: you missing the point
[06:51:02] <dashavoo> Cork: ah, got it. Thanks. I don't know what I did differently, but it worked this time.
[06:51:03] <jacta> http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/2/ can anyone help me out, I want to show the ul thats refered to radio and checked and display none the other
[06:51:21] <Cork> Trisox: off, remove, and so on could just call the native dom functions
[06:51:47] <Cork> Trisox: there behaviors would change a bit, but technically i think they could work without the need for the cache
[06:52:16] <shadow_fox> how can i make this smooth ?? http://jsfiddle.net/UqFfJ/
[06:52:18] <Cork> Trisox: i have a bit of a hard time seeing the point of removing the support for global events if it wasn't to remove that cache later on
[06:52:38] <Kunda> seutje, how do I unescape the && operator ?
[06:52:59] <Cork> Kunda: just write && instead of what you write right now
[06:52:59] <Trisox> i see your point
[06:53:03] <Trisox> Cork
[06:53:45] <seutje> heh
[06:53:50] <Trisox> hey seutje
[06:53:57] <Kunda> seutje, this is what the code looks like, I haven't altered it at all: if (script.readyState && script.onload!==null){
[06:54:29] <Cork> Kunda: and that's what you see if you look at the source in the browser?
[06:55:30] <seutje> js> var foo = document.createElement('div'); foo.innerHTML = '&#038;'; print(foo.innerText);
[06:55:33] <seutje> hey Trisox
[06:55:34] <b-ot> No output.
[06:55:40] <seutje> b-ot: SCOO JOO
[06:56:14] <Kunda> Cork, Nope, I see:  if (script.readyState &#038;&#038; script.onload!==null){
[06:56:23] <Cork> seutje: the bot doesn't have a dom :)
[06:56:30] <seutje> yeah, kinda figured
[06:56:40] <Cork> Kunda: so you're server script does html encoding
[06:56:50] <seutje> I'm too dumb to find a better way to unescape :P
[06:57:02] <Cork> seutje: there isn't another way
[06:57:05] <Cork> except regex
[06:57:15] <jacta> anyone can have a clue about it to help me?
[06:57:39] <Kunda> cork, this wasn't happening before, which leads me to believe something else is causing it
[06:58:19] <Cork> Kunda: most likely something server side
[06:58:39] <seutje> I'm reluctant to learn regex
[06:58:48] <seutje> this way, I can't possibly use it for evil
[06:59:07] <Brodingo> how considerate
[06:59:12] <Cork> you would still have the problem of converting the code to unicode
[06:59:46] <seutje> ?down jsfiddle.net
[06:59:54] <bot-t> seutje, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[07:00:04] <seutje> and just as it replies, jsfiddle loads up
[07:00:29] <jacta> How can I change this, so only nearest ul is visible, and rest will be display:none if not chosen, does it make sense? http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/2/
[07:01:06] <jrajav> I don't think anyone should be allowed to know what regexes are until after Formal Automata
[07:01:31] <seutje> "formal Automata" sounds like a rap track
[07:03:16] <dashavoo> "formal Automata" sound like androids at a ball
[07:03:36] <Cork> js> 'readyState &#038;&#038;'.replace(/&#([0-9]+);/g, function(i, s) { return String.fromCharCode(s); });
[07:03:41] <b-ot> No output.
[07:03:46] <Cork> opps
[07:03:55] <Cork> js> print('readyState &#038;&#038;'.replace(/&#([0-9]+);/g, function(i, s) { return String.fromCharCode(s); }))
[07:03:58] <b-ot> readyState &&
[07:04:05] <Cork> seutje: ;P
[07:05:41] <seutje> Cork: ew
[07:06:36] <Cork> that said; i don't think there's a way to fix &amp; and the like
[07:07:18] <alaing> hi, I have an array of objects and some maybe duplicates. Is there any methods or a way that I could removed the duplicate objects so I only have unique objects in the array
[07:07:27] <seutje> jacta: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/knXxY/3/
[07:07:30] <seutje> ah boo, he left
[07:07:54] <Ignus> hey guys, I need to address an issue I came  into while using jquery-ui in a backbone view. while draggable works, resizable and selectable doesn't
[07:09:43] <seutje> `g array filter
[07:09:44] <b-ot> seutje, Array filter method - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[07:09:55] <seutje> alaing: ^
[07:10:28] <tpyo> hi, trying to modify a bit of draggable code
[07:10:39] <alex88> hi guys, I'm trying an ajax request, I've seen that if the url starts with a slash it requests the actual page, without the leading slash it works fine.. what's wrong with that?
[07:10:47] <tpyo> it takes: ui.draggable.text() and puts it somewhere else
[07:11:06] <tpyo> i would like to (if possible) get a value of an attribute also in that ui.draggable element
[07:11:07] <tpyo> how do?
[07:11:36] <tpyo> i checked the element and it is carrying the attribute during the drag so its there
[07:11:42] <alaing> seutje: Sorry I should have mention it needs to work in IE7
[07:11:49] <Ignus> can someone check this fiddle and give me some insight why resizable won't work in my  ButtonInCanvas view? http://jsfiddle.net/IgnorantUser/u7JkX/
[07:11:51] <tpyo> im just too noob with jquery to know how to extract it correctly
[07:11:55] <Cork> alex88: wehat does it do when it "works fine"?
[07:11:58] <seutje> alaing: jQuery provides a cross-browser implementation of it
[07:12:00] <seutje> iirc
[07:12:13] <seutje> `api filter
[07:12:13] <b-ot> seutje, .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[07:12:21] <Cork> seutje: it does?
[07:12:32] <Cork> seutje: that only works for jquery objects
[07:12:32] <seutje> not that one, b-ot
[07:12:45] <Cork> there isn't a generic one
[07:12:49] <tpyo> i guess it really applies to anything.... if I have an element, how does one extract the value of an attribute within "this"?
[07:12:54] <alex88> Cork, http://pastie.org/5837809
[07:13:03] <seutje> well u can always implement it urself
[07:13:05] <Cork> seutje:  closest you can get is map
[07:13:17] <tpyo> .Attributes["value"] im guessing its not
[07:13:18] <Cork> ?jquery.map
[07:13:21] <bot-t> jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[07:13:41] <seutje> yeah, that with see ?isinarray
[07:13:43] <bot-t> yeah, jQuery.inArray() | jQuery API Documentation - Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[07:13:57] <seutje> fine, just inarray, geez
[07:14:02] <Cork> alex88: and you want to have a relative url or what?
[07:14:32] <tpyo> am I not phrasing my question well? D:
[07:14:34] <alaing> I was thinking about inarray
[07:14:34] <Cork> alex88: /path is an absolute url
[07:14:36] <yannickoo> hey guys, how can I get an element with a xmlns:og attribute?
[07:14:43] <Cork> alex88: and path is a relative url
[07:14:44] <alex88> Cork, I want to have site.com/site/web/app_dev.php/manager/fav/6
[07:14:53] <yannickoo> jQuery('[xmlns:og]') – "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [xmlns:og]"
[07:15:01] <alex88> but with the leading slash it requests current page
[07:15:04] <Cork> alex88: if so then the first one should work just fine
[07:15:13] <alex88> for some reason it doesn't
[07:15:21] <alex88> it queries the actual url
[07:15:35] <Cork> alex88: that is expected
[07:15:43] <randomguy> Hey, is someone familiar with chosen here? I'm trying wo write an ajax based searchbar with a multiple selection. My problem is, I have to remove every option, but the selected options should stay in the bar. Is there a way to do that? using find('option').remove() will clear every option and the input in the searchbar. That's bad.
[07:15:47] <seutje> alaing: paul irish also has an enhancement for $.unique, over at http://paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/
[07:15:54] <alex88> Cork, and to call that absolute url?
[07:16:07] <tpyo> its okay i worked it out, thanks :)
[07:16:16] <Cork> alex88: first: are you running this like local files or something?
[07:16:26] <Cork> alex88: or is it on a real webserver?
[07:17:04] <alex88> Cork, localhost:8080 is the server path
[07:17:12] <Cork> ok so a real server
[07:17:17] <alex88> yup
[07:17:27] <alex88> actual path is http://localhost:8080/site/web/app_dev.php/manager/
[07:17:33] <alex88> and the code is what I've shown you
[07:17:39] <Cork> and when you request /site/web/app_dev.php/manager/fav/6 it doesn't query localhost:8080/site/web/app_dev.php/manager/fav/6 ?
[07:17:57] <alex88> nope, it queries http://localhost:8080/site/web/app_dev.php/manager/
[07:18:05] <Cork> uh....
[07:18:12] <Cork> that makes no sense
[07:18:22] <alaing> thanks seutje I'll take a look at that
[07:18:33] <Cork> do you have urlrewire activeon the server or something?
[07:18:35] <alex88> yup.. thought that too.. :) first it was a result of a function call but now it's hardcoded
[07:18:42] <yannickoo> Can anybody tell me how to fix that? jQuery('[xmlns:og]') – "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [xmlns:og]"
[07:18:42] <alex88> oh...
[07:18:43] <alex88> sec
[07:18:53] <Cork> *urlrewrite
[07:19:01] <alex88> I thought console shows request url not after 302
[07:19:20] <alex88> damn, what an idiot :S sorry cork for the time waste
[07:19:26] <Cork> lol
[07:19:56] <Cork> np, those are not that crasy pitfalls :)
[07:19:58] <dcherman> yannickoo: escape the colon.  see http://learn.jquery.com/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/
[07:20:05] <Cork> i've been there several times my self
[07:20:15] <yannickoo> dcherman: saw that post but it isn't an id, it is an attribute
[07:20:28] <dcherman> yannickoo: doesn't matter, escape it.
[07:20:33] <Ignus> guys, can anybody spare some time and take a look at my code here: http://jsfiddle.net/IgnorantUser/u7JkX/ apparently selectable and draggable won't work in my "ButtonInCanvas" backbone view
[07:20:35] <alex88> that's what happens after a day of work :)
[07:20:46] <yannickoo> dcherman++
[07:33:25] <Ignus> anyone?
[07:37:37] <nights> hello
[07:37:41] <nights> why does this give me an error?
[07:37:43] <nights> if ( $(this).find('.validation_error').length )
[07:38:03] <nights> this works one line below
[07:38:08] <nights> i mean the object this
[07:40:22] <velcrobots> anybody know what's up with jsfiddle?  been slow for a day or two now
[07:40:34] <shoky> Ignus:  the container needs to be .selectable()  not the actual selectables
[07:41:02] <Ignus> ok, but what about the resizable?
[07:43:17] <nights> any ideas why this doesnt run? if ( $(this).find('.validation_error').length )
[07:44:26] <yannickoo> what is better? $(foo).find('.validation_error') or $('.validation_error', foo);
[07:44:28] <nights> nevermind
[07:44:41] <nights> apparently it was the continue that was no good
[07:44:46] <nights> :X
[07:45:01] <shoky> yannickoo:  the 2nd is a "shortcut" for the 1st. they do exactly the same thing
[07:45:19] <yannickoo> shoky++
[07:45:21] <yannickoo> thank you :)
[07:45:28] <shoky> ;p
[07:45:50] <Ignus> shoky, thanx for pointing out that .selectable() should be used in the container, but what about .resizable() that also doesn't work?

[07:46:36] <shoky> Ignus:  the .resizable doesnt work good because you're replacing the .html() of the element in your render function, i think
[07:47:15] <shoky> Ignus: put an element inside the resizable element and change its contents instead, i think
[07:48:50] <Ignus> thanx shoky, will try it

[07:56:47] <superdmp> if something calls jQuery.sortable(), does that imply the jqueryui.sortable library?
[07:57:19] <shoky> superdmp: jQuery.sortable() ?  what's calling that
[07:57:24] <alaing> seutje: just knocking up a jsfiddle
[07:57:28] <shoky> do you mean jQuery(...).sortable() ?
[07:57:45] <superdmp> shoky:  well, I have: InlineOrdering.jQuery("div.inline-group").sortable({
[07:57:55] <alaing> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/gTWc4/2/
[07:57:57] <shoky> superdmp: ok that's not jQuery.sortable()
[07:58:07] <shoky> superdmp:  that is probably jquery-ui, yeah
[07:58:10] <superdmp> sorry I should have said jQuery().sortable()
[07:58:23] <superdmp> thanks shoky
[07:58:27] <kuter> bye everyone
[07:58:38] <Ignus> shoky, awesome! One more question should i use this.$contents.html(this.template(this.model.toJSON())); in rendering or this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()));  inside init? (tried it and it also works). Having in mind that a button might be rendered many times (color change, css properties change) wouldn't it be more wise to get the "caption" in the initialization?
[07:59:39] <shoky> Ignus:  i assumed you had a special reason to do those stuff in the render function.. stuff like color/css properties are rendered by the browser automatically anyway
[08:00:08] <shoky> Ignus: putting it in the initialize is fine, if it's not gonna change.  just guessing tho, i dont know backbone
[08:01:02] <shoky> Ignus: and yeah i suppose if you put it in the initialize you don't need that extra div
[08:01:26] <fRAiLtY-> Ok I've put it all in a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/
[08:01:44] <fRAiLtY-> Need to lose the days and countdown to 11am every day
[08:02:16] <shoky> Ignus: but hmm doesn't this.template(this.model.toJSON()) change dynamically and cause a re-render?
[08:02:18] <lil-murph> Is there a best-practice syntax to running like 4 or 5 ajax requests in a row? I'm imagining all kinds of callbacks calling callbacks which is going to be hard to work with?
[08:04:10] <Maverick|MSG> I believe lightbox2 is having some sort of js conflict.  What's the best way to determine where they might be butting heads?
[08:04:15] <Ignus> shoky, well i want the user to be able to change css properties of each button model so getters/setters for css properties are needed inside the render, but for the caption I think i can initialize it as "Button" and re-render the model on change ;) Thanx for your help!!!
[08:04:22] <fRAiLtY-> Is it me or is fiddle down
[08:05:51] <shoky> it's ill
[08:05:52] <alaing> How can I output only unique objects in an array http://jsfiddle.net/gTWc4/2/
[08:07:17] <shoky> lil-murph: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ajaxQueue
[08:07:21] <Cork> alaing: you you could create an empty array, and then loop over the old array and add the values to the new array and do $.inArray() on the new array to see if its in there
[08:08:05] <alaing> Cork: check the key and value for the object before adding to the new array?
[08:08:29] <Cork> ah you want to check objects
[08:09:04] <Cork> that makes it a bit trickier
[08:09:19] <lil-murph> shoky: interesting, thx
[08:09:31] <Cork> alaing: what is it you need it for?
[08:09:36] <alaing> Yes, var arr = [{'a':1},{'a':1},{'a':2}]; should be [{'a':1},{'a':2}]
[08:10:37] <alaing> Cork, I'm workign with jQuery Flot plugin and I have a table that determines what to draw in the chart
[08:11:38] <alaing> Cork: I'm trying to see how many unique serie formats for serie types(bar,line, etc) to build up the options I need to the Flot plugin
[08:12:01] <alaing> for serie types(bar,line, etc) = and serie types(bar,line, etc)
[08:12:36] <Cork> alaing: do you have an id or something you can use for the object?
[08:13:14] <Cork> alaing: its actually quite hard to check if two objects in an array is the same (you would have to check each and every key in the object)
[08:14:08] <Cork> and worst of all, its close to impossible to make that performant
[08:14:44] <alaing> Cork, the actually values are part of part of a tr .data()
[08:15:05] <alaing> that i'm throwing into an array
[08:15:09] <Cork> so they all belong to a dom element?
[08:16:04] <alaing> basically each tr  that needs to be included in the chart has a series type and series format.
[08:16:10] <Cork> the reason i ask is cause you can check if two dom element references hare the same
[08:16:31] <Cork> elm === other elm
[08:16:48] <Cork> problem is { a:1 } !== { a:1 }
[08:17:11] <Cork> js > print({ a: 1 } === { a: 1 })
[08:17:20] <Cork> js> print({ a: 1 } === { a: 1 })
[08:17:23] <b-ot> false
[08:17:32] <alaing> I basically builing an array eg. arrMyseries which I then say table.data(arrMyseries)
[08:17:54] <Cork> ok, so you plan on adding the array to a tr
[08:18:00] <Cork> its not based on it?
[08:18:04] <Ignus> shoky, could you briefly explain the difference between this.$el.html and this.$contents.html?
[08:18:22] <shoky> Ignus:  this.$contents is a <div> i created
[08:18:43] <shoky> Ignus:  which i appended to this.$el
[08:18:59] <alaing> the .data() placed on the table is so I dont have to work through the table again just to get the data
[08:19:17] <shoky> Ignus: i created it in the initialize function:  this.$contents = $('<div>').appendTo(this.$el);
[08:19:24] <alaing> I plan on adding the array to table not tr
[08:19:36] <Cork> alaing: yes but the question was do you have any id you can use for the objects
[08:19:41] <Ignus> oh, now i get it! :) I was searching the jquery docs for a .contents :P thanks again shoky!
[08:19:46] <shoky> ;]
[08:20:02] <Cork> alaing: as you can't check if one object is the same as another without checking every member
[08:20:09] <alaing> unfortunately the tr donts use id
[08:20:24] <Cork> alaing: uh...
[08:20:37] <alaing> the table has an id
[08:20:37] <Cork> so each object in the array is referencing a dom tr element?
[08:20:47] <Cork> alaing: thats not the question
[08:20:59] <alaing> I loop through all the tr to get the series and then loop through the td to get that series data
[08:21:26] <Cork> ok, and you want to remove the ones where two tr has the same data?
[08:22:43] <alaing> basically the html fo the tr is <tr date-optflot-seriestype="1" data-optflot-seriesformat="%"> <td>apples</td><td>100</td>
[08:22:49] <alaing> </tr
[08:23:21] <ideaprison> can anyone tell me why this results in a error "unexpected token ILLEGAL" http://pastebin.com/CikTm5ym
[08:23:27] <NodeX> if I am loading some javascript async with an auto executing anonymous function (let's say like the analytics method but my OWN code) and I have some inline javascript on a page, how can I make my inline javascript (that's using $(document).ready()... wait for my async to load ... can I write a function that queues these things and executes them then is overwritten by jquery's own document.ready
[08:23:27] <NodeX> method?
[08:23:33] <alaing> each tr would content would be unique because the children would have different figures
[08:23:56] <Cork> alaing: so when can the duplicates arise?
[08:23:57] <alaing> each tr's content would be unique because the children would have different figures
[08:24:20] <Cork> that's what i've beem trying to get to since we started...
[08:24:22] <alaing> two tr with the same  date-optflot-seriestype="1" data-optflot-seriesformat="%"
[08:24:35] <seutje> ideaprison: the linebreak?
[08:24:38] <alaing> Cork sorry trying to work out what you asking me
[08:25:10] <Cork> alaing: ok, so the only option you have is to loop over the array, then loop over both objects and compare the keys and values to see if they are the same
[08:25:12] <fRAiLtY-> I have created a fiddle for you guys, how to ignore/not show the days and countdown to 11am each day, then restart. Currently each refresh it starts with a 10 day lead time http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/
[08:25:14] <alaing> basically duplicate attributres
[08:25:15] <seutje> ideaprison: ur also throwing a key into the values bit
[08:25:37] <Cork> that means a LOT of for loops, but as you have noway to do it without actually comparing the content of the objects...
[08:26:05] <alaing> can i not just compare the tr without the children?
[08:26:22] <Cork> if the two tr's are the exact same tr you can
[08:26:31] <Cork> (not different dom elements)
[08:26:45] <alaing> something like remove <td> and then compare?
[08:26:49] <ideaprison> se
[08:26:59] <Cork> alaing: no no need to do that
[08:27:02] <ideaprison> seutje: thanks, totally did not see that (never had it happen either) d0h
[08:27:38] <ideaprison> i know that code looks weird but its step 1 in making something awesome :p its not about the actualy gradient bit that much (yadayada)
[08:27:44] <Cork> alaing: if the data attributes can never be duplicated on different tr elements, you can just ask jquery to filter out the duplicate tr elements from the selected elements
[08:27:45] <alaing> so I can compare tr against another tr and its children(i.e td) will not impact the result
[08:28:16] <Cork> alaing: but if you have something like <tr data-something="1"></tr>.....<tr data-something="1"></tr> that won't work
[08:28:40] <Cork> alaing: two tr elements won't ever be the same
[08:28:56] <Cork> only if you have pointers to the same dom element can they be compared
[08:29:38] <Cork> ex $('#special-tr')[0] === $('#special-tr')[0] === true
[08:30:07] <alaing> is this because they would have different indexes within the table?
[08:30:26] <Cork> alaing: each dom element have a reference id in the browser
[08:30:42] <Cork> that's why you can check if two references to the same dom element are the same
[08:31:05] <Cork> it doesn't check if the serialized html would be the same
[08:31:26] <Cork> html has no importance when you're working with the dom
[08:31:32] <alaing> Cork brb.
[08:31:33] <Cork> its just a source used to build the dom
[08:39:15] <iiicubed> morning all... i'm looking for either a css selector, dom parsing method, or existing jquery method to determine if node B appears AFTER node A in a document
[08:39:39] <monk3y> @%@$^%#$^@#$% @ IE and $(document).ready()
[08:39:47] <monk3y> </rant>
[08:39:54] * monk3y gets back in box
[08:40:24] <iiicubed> caveat: AFTER from a display perspective - as in, node B's position (in normal document flow) is affected by node A's box model
[08:40:30] <Cork> iiicubed: after on the same level, or just after?
[08:41:05] <iiicubed> Cork: after as in node B's position is affected by node A's box model
[08:41:33] <Cork> wait, you mean including something like absolute positioned?
[08:41:38] <alaing> Cork back
[08:42:01] <iiicubed> Cork: no, irregardless of ABSOLUTE positioning...
[08:42:13] <iiicubed> Cork: only in a normal document flow...
[08:42:19] <alaing> crok could I perhaps compare the string?
[08:42:35] <samuelgoodwin> hey guys!
[08:42:39] <Cork> iiicubed: ok, is it enough if its on sibling level or does it have to be any level?
[08:42:43] <iiicubed> Cork: so, nobe B is not necessarily a "relative" (descendant, sibling, etc...) of node A
[08:42:50] <Cork> ok
[08:43:00] <iiicubed> Cork: any level... therein lies the challenge! :)
[08:43:00] <alaing> Cork: could I perhaps compare the string of the <tr>?
[08:43:25] <alaing> bey0nd	hey alaing , don't say bullshit in #jquery , asshole!???
[08:43:29] <Cork> iiicubed:  $('#nodeA, #nodeB')[0] === $('#nodeA')[0]
[08:43:40] <Cork> its false if #nodeB comes before #nodeA in the document
[08:43:47] <Lindrian> How do I select the nth element with a certain class?
[08:44:24] <Cork> alaing: you could do something like JSON.stringify the object and compare that string
[08:44:38] <samuelgoodwin> I'm having trouble providing the Token Authorization headers in my ajax request. Is this not the correct way to do this? https://gist.github.com/4609557 I included how I would make the same request with curl that works just fine.
[08:44:42] <Cork> alaing: but if the keys are in different order you will get false negatives
[08:44:59] <Cork> alaing: string of the tr will have the same problem
[08:45:14] <iiicubed> Cork: huh... very much a "DUH!" solution, but not strictly obvious...
[08:45:16] <Cork> except there you will have the problem with children
[08:45:21] <alaing> Shouldn't be a problem because its a server side script thats producing the html
[08:45:21] <iiicubed> Cork: I like!  thanks! :)
[08:45:30] <Cork> iiicubed: np :)
[08:47:56] <alaing> Cork:  coudl I perhaps have something like $('tr:has[data-optflot-seriestype]') to return all tr with that attribute and then produce a unique array of their values?
[08:48:11] <dp> I want to .append() a piece of html like <input type="text" name="<uniq>"> to a jquery selection. is there a way to do this with one .append() but have the <uniq> part be based on the current element being appended to?
[08:48:21] <BillCriswell> alaing: td[data-optflot-seriestype] is what you'd want.
[08:48:41] <dp> essentially I want objects.each() functionality, but preferably without calling .each()
[08:48:42] <Cork> alaing: ya that could be done
[08:49:01] <alaing> BillCriswell: thanks :-)
[08:49:21] <Cork> dp: no, you would have to keep that up to date in a variable you're self
[08:49:42] <alaing> Cork: I guess it just means I have to work through the table again but if its easy then why not
[08:49:42] <superdmp> if I'm using jQuery UI - <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.9.2/jquery-ui.min.js"></script> - what am I supposed to do about CSS for it? is there anything I *need* to do to get started?
[08:49:50] <superdmp> http://jqueryui.com/Getting_Started is not available, by the way
[08:49:54] <dp> Cork: ok. thought so, but thought I'd ask at the same time
[08:50:08] <BillCriswell> alaing: You coudl do like... var arr = $('tr[data-foo]').map(function(){ return $(this).attr('data-foo'); });
[08:50:17] <Cork> alaing: that is a slower option then looping the objects though
[08:50:45] <Cork> alaing: cause you would have to do dom selections over and over again, and thats slower then looping objects over and over again
[08:51:22] <alaing> Cork: I know my objects will always only ever have two key/value pairs
[08:51:23] <Cork> ?g javascript object isequal
[08:51:24] <bot-t> Cork, hashcode - How do you determine equality for two JavaScript ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/201183/how-do-you-determine-equality-for-two-javascript-objects
[08:51:33] <wolfehr_> superdmp: one option http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[08:51:44] <Cork> alaing: then theres even less reason to do multiple selections
[08:52:18] <Cork> alaing: you would have to compare the two keys and values for those keys for every object though
[08:53:00] <alaing> Cork: thanks for you help
[08:53:07] <Cork> np
[08:53:18] <alaing> Cork I think I'll need to read through that stackoverflow and have a rethink
[08:53:42] <Cork> not sure if that ones the best though
[08:53:46] <alaing> Cork: your help very much appreciated
[08:53:58] <Cork> but just google for object isequal and you should find a bunch
[08:54:07] <superdmp> wolfehr: thanks, but I am trying to understand a basic concept first - I presume it needs some CSS; will  it go looking for that itself? or do I have to load the CSS myself?
[08:55:13] <alaing> Yeah it shoudl be too hard because I know they will only ever have 2 key/value paris and its just the number of objects with in the array that could vary but at most there would be able 10 objects in that array so its very small
[08:55:32] <wolfehr> superdmp: you need to have a jquery ui css file loaded (all of the classes used for styling need to have a definition somewhere)
[08:56:03] <awc737> what could this error mean? and it is only in IE8
[08:56:12] <awc737> typing that in debian connects me to my localhost, from WIndows VM nothing
[08:56:16] <awc737> oops
[08:56:19] <Cork> alaing: ya, then it should be fine; its a bit sad to have to loop like that though
[08:56:26] <wolfehr> superdmp: if you don't have a jquery ui css file, all of your jquery ui modules will just appear unstyled (as they have the classes applied, but those classes don't have a definition anywhere)
[08:56:28] <awc737> here is the error: SCRIPT1028: Expected indentifier, string or number
[08:56:40] <awc737> well here is line 230: }).done(function(data) {
[08:56:40] <superdmp> wolfehr: so http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.9.0/themes/base/jquery-ui.css in my stylesheets?
[08:56:50] <awc737> character 3 supposedly, which is the period.
[08:57:00] <wolfehr> superdmp, yeah that'd do it
[08:57:16] <Cork> awc737: you have a key without a value possibly?
[08:57:23] <superdmp> thanks wolfehr
[08:57:25] <grafi> or a , too much
[08:57:31] <Cork> awc737: or a value without a key
[08:57:48] <awc737> I think it's a jQuery bug with ie8 Cork , how can it be character 3 of this line:
[08:57:49] <awc737> }).done(function(data) {
[08:58:14] <Cork> awc737: you need to look at whats above that line too
[08:58:21] <Cork> all the way up to the starting {
[08:58:23] <iiicubed> Cork: i'm testing your A before B? solution... and $('#nodeA, #nodeB') seems to return the same array order as $('#nodeB, #nodeA')...?
[08:58:36] <iiicubed> Cork: so the comparison is moot... :/
[08:58:37] <Cork> iiicubed: it does
[08:58:52] <awc737> Cork, http://paste.laravel.com/fBS
[08:58:54] <wolfehr> aw737, comment out functions one by one until you don't get an error anymore, then you'll have isolated the issue
[08:58:56] <Cork> iiicubed: no you check if the element you expect to be first is the first in the resulting array
[08:59:01] <awc737> oh
[08:59:07] <awc737> I think it's the trailing , on data:
[08:59:18] <Cork> tada
[08:59:23] <grafi> as i said ;)
[08:59:38] <grafi> should probably have highlighted you :x
[09:00:14] <Cork> iiicubed: jquery will always return the elements in the order they exist in the dom
[09:00:40] <Cork> iiicubed: so if you select the two elements you want to check and see if the first one is the one you expect to be first; you will know if it is
[09:00:42] <awc737> lol, I always use a trailing comma on the last item of every array
[09:00:45] <awc737> never knew it was an issue
[09:00:57] <Cork> awc737: its only an issue in ie
[09:01:09] <Cork> it wants to be special
[09:01:25] <grafi> it is special
[09:02:11] <grafi> http://ansonalex.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IE-eats-glue.jpg
[09:02:36] <iiicubed> Cork: I get the logic, and jQuery returning a document order makes sense... but it doesn't seem to be working that way:
[09:03:05] <iiicubed> Cork: $("[data-cox-ajax-url], [data-cox-new-feature]:visible") RETURNS [ul.amount, ul.alerts]
[09:03:20] <Cork> iiicubed: the order of the selectors in the string isn't what i meant by document order
[09:03:26] <iiicubed> Cork: $("[data-cox-new-feature]:visible, [data-cox-ajax-url]") RETURNS [ul.amount, ul.alerts]
[09:03:30] <Cork> it doens't matter what order you write the selectors
[09:03:50] <iiicubed> Cork: ok... OK...
[09:04:00] <Cork> but you can do ex. $("[data-cox-new-feature]:visible, [data-cox-ajax-url]")[0] === $("[data-cox-new-feature]:visible")
[09:04:08] <iiicubed> Cork: DUH!  wow!... where are my big coder undies?!
[09:04:09] <Cork> opps
[09:04:25] <Cork> meant $("[data-cox-new-feature]:visible, [data-cox-ajax-url]")[0] === $("[data-cox-new-feature]:visible")[0]
[09:04:31] <awc737> is this not OK in ie?
[09:04:32] <awc737> position: absolute; left: -10000px;
[09:04:44] <Cork> awc737: in css?
[09:04:51] <awc737> yeah
[09:05:04] <Cork> depends what version of ie
[09:05:10] <awc737> lol what is the proper # to bitch and inquire about IE inconsistencies?
[09:05:22] <Cork> for css its #css
[09:05:27] <awc737> ie8 does not seem to do what the rest do for that
[09:05:27] <awc737> k
[09:05:34] <iiicubed> awc737: #dIE maybe?
[09:05:39] <awc737> haha
[09:05:57] <awc737> damn, that should have been a channel
[09:06:06] <Cork> or jquery2.0 mandatory upgrade ^^
[09:06:12] * iiicubed nods
[09:06:16] <Cork> :D
[09:06:18] <grafi> awc737: http://i.imgur.com/h2JClux.jpg
[09:06:32] <Cork> lol
[09:07:05] <grafi> lets hope the trend goes on
[09:07:15] <awc737> lol! what does that correlation mean?
[09:07:18] <Cork> you mean most murderers are webdevelopers?
[09:08:05] <iiicubed> Cork: Dexter ?= WebDeveloper?
[09:08:14] <Cork> :)
[09:08:47] <Gho5t> awc737: you really have to ask?
[09:09:01] <Gho5t> is IE not one of your target browsers...ever?
[09:09:02] <awc737> lol I'm thick

[10:18:24] <theusbar_> Hi there, I am creating a custom plugin for jquery. So i started as $.fn.my_plugin(){ /*plugin body*/ }. I was wondering if there is any 'init' function I can create to automatically call when the plugin is called. Basically, what happens when $('#id').my_plugin(); is called?
[10:20:58] <thang> theusbar_: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring theres a section on adding an init block under Events
[10:22:49] <idletask> Hello
[10:23:46] <idletask> One simple question: I have learned on this channel that it was frowned upon specifying "onclick" directly in <a> elements -- but what if this "onclik" just does "history:back();"?
[10:23:57] <idletask> Err, history.back(), sorry
[10:25:20] <theusbar_> thang: Thank you, sorry about that. Actuallly I was just reading that part.
[10:26:18] <theusbar_> idletask: http://w3schools.com/jsref/prop_doc_referrer.asp
[10:27:16] <thang> idletask: thats more of an organizational thing, you wanna keep all your JS in JS files and keep HTML separate for sanity sake
[10:27:31] <idletask> I guess so
[10:27:38] <idletask> I am still worse than a rookie
[10:27:52] <thang> we all were once

[10:28:47] <here4thegear> I'm using $.getJSON and throwing the following error which google is no help with "TypeError: $.getJSON is not a function".
[10:30:12] <here4thegear> Here's the page I'm working on which is throwing that error http://truefmonline.com/player_test/
[10:31:29] <crivera> why doesn't this work: $("#elm").focus(); $("#elm").blur();
[10:31:32] <crivera> the element remains focused
[10:31:53] <crivera> it works if i give "blur" a setTimeout but doens't work when the calls are immediately back to back
[10:32:02] <crivera> i'm trying to simulate a form fill.  focus, fill val, blur out
[10:32:06] <crivera> but the blur never happens
[10:33:30] <thang> here4thegear: so if you open up a console on that page and try to look at $.getJSON nothing autocompletes so it seems like its not defined, versus if you did that on like jquery.com , either way if youre not married to that version of jquery id upgrade
[10:33:42] <BillCriswell> crivera: Can you focus on something else instead of blurring?
[10:34:33] <crivera> BillCriswell: that's what i was initially doing, but some websites were acting funky with it
[10:34:46] <crivera> i'm just trying to simulate the exact events of what happens when a user is filling out a form
[10:34:58] <crivera> i thought it'd be .focus, .val, .change, .blur
[10:36:14] <BillCriswell> crivera: Hmm...
[10:36:33] <here4thegear> thang: yes, it was the version of jquery, thank you!
[10:40:00] <BillCriswell> crivera: Are you sure the blur never happens? I just tried this and the events do happen... just nothing visually. http://jsbin.com/edazoz/1/edit

[10:43:25] <crivera> BillCriswell: ahh it is working.  it looks like this form is doing an additional focus.  your mini script helped me see that. thanks
[10:43:37] <BillCriswell> crivera: No problem at all.
[10:43:55] <jeffsmykil> is there a way to refer to the selector when doing something like this $(".foo").html($(this).attr("data-bar"));
[10:44:23] <BillCriswell> jeffsmykil: You can use a function in html.
[10:44:45] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').html(function(originalHTML){ return $(this).attr('data-bar'); });
[10:44:52] <jeffsmykil> BillCriswell: well there are a ton of .foos
[10:45:02] <BillCriswell> jeffsmykil: That's ok.
[10:45:08] <jeffsmykil> snippet
[10:45:12] <jeffsmykil> Snippet please?
[10:45:19] <BillCriswell> What?
[10:45:44] <jeffsmykil> oh there it is
[10:45:48] <jeffsmykil> i see sorry
[10:45:52] <BillCriswell> Haha ok.
[10:46:15] <jeffsmykil> is originalHTML a thing?
[10:46:36] <BillCriswell> it's just what i'm calling it, it can be whatever you want, or nothing.
[10:46:44] <BillCriswell> It's there in case you need it.
[10:47:04] <BillCriswell> it can be named*
[10:47:12] <jeffsmykil> yeah that worked like a charm
[10:47:17] <jeffsmykil> i figured there must be a way to do it
[10:47:22] <jeffsmykil> just wasn't sure the syntax
[10:47:25] <jeffsmykil> thanks a bunch
[10:47:29] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:48:09] <BillCriswell> I actually make  small mistake.  originalHTML would be the index of that element, you'd want to pass two arguments.
[10:48:23] <BillCriswell> .html( index, originalHTML ){ return 'whatever'; }
[10:48:43] <BillCriswell> .html( function(index, originalHTML){ return 'whatever' }); *
[10:48:58] <jeffsmykil> i actually don't need either so i took the parameter out completely and it works great
[10:49:06] <BillCriswell> jeffsmykil: Sweet.
[10:51:02] <p0rk> Is there anyway to create a targetted drag-drop box that when a file is dropped into it, it will mimmick dropping the file onto the file upload box instead?
[10:51:24] <p0rk> i essentialyl want to upload a file by drag-n-drop but i want to drop onto a stylized div, not directly onto the input file boxc
[10:52:07] <zim> Hi all. I have been trying to find a print_r equiv for javascript the consensus is console.log(). but how do I use it?
[10:52:08] <BillCriswell> p0rk: Probably better asking Google. This looks promising: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[10:52:28] <thang> ^^
[10:52:37] <p0rk> BillCriswell, I saw that but it looks like a lot of overkill
[10:52:41] <zim> I need to look at the structure of an object
[10:52:41] <dhab> no one with knockoutjs experience out there?
[10:53:00] <p0rk> Im using a standard input type=file which natively supports the drag-n-drop. Was hoping to just create a psuedo drop target of sorts.
[10:53:42] <thang> p0rk: well in the context of answering your question, theres an event that gets fired when you drag&drop a file, so if you bind to that event to manipulate your div you should be on your way
[10:53:45] <shoky> dhab: are you sure the double-bind is still an issue with latest knockout?
[10:53:59] <p0rk> thang, hmmm. on the right track.
[10:54:07] <thang> p0rk: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop
[10:55:26] <shoky> dhab: nevermind, it is
[10:56:20] <BillCriswell> Dammit. Now I want to try this drag and drop thing out.
[10:57:01] <p0rk> lol
[10:58:51] <BillCriswell> I wish I wasn't working right now.
[10:58:53] <dhab> shoky: thanks for confirming.  ;-)
[10:58:58] <BillCriswell> This shit is for the birds.
[11:05:30] <loool> helo frindz
[11:05:41] <loool> where is a good place to put events
[11:05:48] <loool> like window.resize
[11:08:00] <Caelum> how do you check if jquery-ui is loaded?
[11:08:21] <BillCriswell> Caelum: jQuery.ui
[11:08:28] <EweR> Goodevenin lads!
[11:09:01] <loool> Caelum: if(jQuery
[11:09:15] <loool> see if its a object
[11:09:17] <BillCriswell> var jQueryYouEyeIsLoaded = jQuery.ui ? true : false;
[11:09:36] <Caelum> thank you
[11:14:44] <edrichardfr> french ?
[11:16:00] <BillCriswell> edrichardfr: I only ever see English in here. =(
[11:16:50] <edrichardfr> my english is very bad
[11:16:54] <edrichardfr> sorry
[11:17:28] <edrichardfr> do you use the module simpleCartjs : http://simplecartjs.org/
[11:23:15] <sstratis> Can any one tell me what could cause
[11:23:46] <sstratis> Jquery Validate to not pass data to the server on a form submit but also not display the error tool tip?
[11:24:03] <sstratis> This is when a field is left blank
[11:24:04] <Phoenixz> On jquery mobile, trying to use panels, added HTML as shown on http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html, but  instead of a panel, I get the panel contents shown right above the header.. the panel open/close button does nothing.. What might be the problem?
[11:24:44] <Phoenixz> I have <div data-role="panel" id="menupanel" data-theme="b">content...</div> right after <div data-role="page" id="home"> and right before <div data-role="header" data-position="inline">
[11:24:50] <Zeeshan_M> sstratis, can you provide a test case showing your jQuery Validate error? Use http://jsfiddle.net to upload a sample HTML document and its JS code.
[11:26:25] <sstratis> Sure, oddly enough though I have no console errors. I'm beginning to think it's server side related.
[11:26:43] <djQuery> any way to get jquery mobile to scroll content divs without pushing the footer off the screen
[11:27:38] <Zeeshan_M> If you're happy to provide your live URL, I can test that too.
[11:29:10] <thang> djQuery: try checking this out: http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4
[11:29:18] <someprimetime> uh wtf
[11:29:19] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/nHSt4/
[11:29:22] <someprimetime> check console.log
[11:29:38] <someprimetime> maximum call stack size reached for $radio.trigger('click');
[11:29:44] <someprimetime> what the heck?
[11:29:50] <someprimetime> same thing happens on $radio.click()
[11:29:58] <someprimetime> should I be using prop instead then?
[11:31:14] <djQuery> thang, looks good was hoping for a built in method
[11:32:02] <Zeeshan_M> someprimetime, you're triggering a recurisive loop. $radioBtn.on('click', $radioBtn, function (evt) { } looks into the click event.
[11:32:11] <thang> djQuery: ive messed around with this a lot, its more of an html problem where some elements get rendered outside the visual viewport for whatever reason (on iOS for me), so i settled on that
[11:32:12] <Zeeshan_M> Inside of that, you then proceed to manually trigger click again.
[11:32:25] <Zeeshan_M> A recurisive loop then occurs.
[11:32:40] <Zeeshan_M> looks = hooks
[11:32:43] <djQuery> someprimetime, thought that if you have the input hidden that it is not included in a submit
[11:32:53] <liox_> personnel can someone please help me already tried everything to run a plugin smoothDivScroll after being carredo with an ajax () and got no result.
[11:33:14] <someprimetime> ah shit you're absolutely right
[11:33:17] <someprimetime> thanks Zeeshan_M
[11:33:30] <someprimetime> kinda leet though
[11:33:32] <someprimetime> I may just leave it
[11:33:53] <Zeeshan_M> I ain't mad at cha.
[11:34:18] <djQuery> someprimetime, you might try hiding them just by moving them off the viewport by setting the left or what not
[11:34:43] <Zeeshan_M> djinni, someprimetime = thang.
[11:35:05] <someprimetime> yeah I've done this before but I was just trying to simplify code to reuse it on another project
[11:35:37] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/C5C2x/26/ there it was
[11:36:00] <thang> wait what
[11:36:13] <liox_> my paste http://pastebin.com/c5QigewX
[11:38:23] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/nHSt4/1/
[11:38:25] <someprimetime> that's cleaner IMO
[11:38:28] <someprimetime> done.
[11:40:26] <TiffanyAmber> GOOOOOOODDDDD MORRRNING VIETNAMMMMMM

[11:43:49] <tbjAtCInUFPE> Hey guys
[11:44:20] <Phoenixz> Anybody who might know why the content of <div data-role="panel" id="defaultpanel" data-theme="b">.......</div> migth show right away right above the header, instead of being hidden and only showing in the panel when it pops up?
[11:49:24] <loool> gaize!
[11:49:27] <loool> help kay
[11:49:38] <loool> wer i put windows.resize
[11:49:41] <loool> in a module
[11:49:51] <loool> wers a good place to put
[11:49:58] <loool> so its neat and encapsulated
[11:50:20] <loool> right not its just hanging outside of my module object
[11:50:28] <loool> and its ugly
[11:52:19] <Phoenixz> Why am I seeing the panel above the header with this jquery mobile example? http://jsfiddle.net/KHhFD/ As I understand it,I should not see the panel at all, it should only show up if I click a panel link, or execute some jquerymobile to make it show as a panel, not just an ordinary div as it looks like right now..
[11:52:39] <tbjAtCInUFPE> Me and some colleagues are looking for a open source project so we can try and help a little. It`s related to a class at our university and the first  "job" we have is to help translating documentation or tutorials to our native language (pt-BR) and we would like to try helping the jQuery project. So, is there someone who we can talk to in order to get started with this work
[11:55:18] <tbjAtCInUFPE> A friend of mine already posted about it on the forums (http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-start-translating-tutorials-for-the-jquery-page) but there was no answer
[11:58:18] <Phoenixz> Why am I seeing the panel above the header with this jquery mobile example? http://jsfiddle.net/KHhFD/ As I understand it,I should not see the panel at all, it should only show up if I click a panel link, or execute some jquerymobile to make it show as a panel, not just an ordinary div as it looks like right now..
[12:01:03] <loool> y no one help me
[12:01:42] <thang> tbjAtCInUFPE: i dont know how they would go about something like that, but you could probably just open a ticket on github and start doing it there, then file a pull request
[12:02:13] <thang> if its for academic purposes the pull request of the translated documentation should suffice for credit
[12:02:36] <Phoenixz> Cleaned it up a bit more : http://jsfiddle.net/KHhFD/3/  ... ITs still showing the panel on the top, and I do not get why.. AFAIK, I am doing the exact same thing as in the documentation here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html or not?
[12:07:19] <PPKuma> Hi guys, im trying to pass a variable between the hover functions, can't i store it in the a element? http://jsfiddle.net/kumiau/Uvpdf/
[12:08:43] <TiffanyAmber> hi guys! Howdy!
[12:08:48] <TiffanyAmber> I want to get an id from my page
[12:08:58] <TiffanyAmber> page?id=40
[12:08:58] <TiffanyAmber> how can I get it with jquery?
[12:10:24] <PPKuma> TiffanyAmber: You would be better off getting it from a wordpress function than from the url.
[12:10:46] <PPKuma> in case you later would like to use friendly urls
[12:11:17] <thang> TiffanyAmber: window.location.search ?
[12:11:29] <fs__> could this be for real
[12:11:32] <Phoenixz> TiffanyAmber: https://www.google.com.mx/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&sugexp=les%3B&gs_rn=1&gs_ri=hp&tok=WYkaT-5iYZpPYPTZFkpydQ&cp=26&gs_id=s&xhr=t&q=javascript+window.location&es_nrs=true&pf=p&safe=off&tbo=d&sclient=psy-ab&oq=javascript+window.location&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.41248874,d.b2U&fp=d4a9e0fcef9d79df&ion=1&biw=1440&bih=812
[12:11:50] <Phoenixz> fs__: Whah?
[12:12:49] <fs__> phoenixz__: are you a master of jquery ui?
[12:13:50] <fs__> consider this:
[12:13:53] <fs__> var $my_tab = $( "#tabs" ).tabs();
[12:14:04] <fs__> var sel = $my_tab.tabs('option','selected');
[12:14:24] <fs__> why doesnt this work
[12:14:47] <Phoenixz> fs__: I can not get a @#(*$@ panel to work, do I sound like a master? Check google, I see nobody ever having a problem with a panel.. I.. can.. not.. get.. the.. @W#$R(*@# thing to work.. it shows as a common div, thats it.. all the rest works as it should.. Do I sound like a master?
[12:15:25] <fs__> no you sound just as a rookie like me
[12:15:25] <Phoenixz> fs__: try "var mytab = ....." not "var $mytab = ......" we're not doing PHP here..
[12:15:48] <Phoenixz> fs__: not really a rookie, but by god, I am frustrated with this..
[12:16:33] <fs__> phoenixz: to be honest, jquery can be just as frustrating as good
[12:17:32] <Phoenixz> Anybody? http://jsfiddle.net/cUpak/ ? Why is this panel showing as a normal div?? Why why why? Its the most simple and basic thing.. Everything else works, but this panel that I need does not.
[12:18:44] <Phoenixz> Also, why is the data-icon="bars" not working? Its in the documentation, but when I use it I see a plus... ?
[12:20:01] <fs__> jsfiddle.net is that something worthy
[12:20:20] <Zeeshan_M> Phoenixz, checking your question now.
[12:22:36] <Mottie1> pheonixz: maybe because the stylesheet from 1.2 doesn't have panels?
[12:23:46] <Phoenixz> fs__: Its the way to go if you want to test and show things on IRC
[12:23:56] <Phoenixz> Mottie1: you *have* to be kidding me...
[12:24:16] <Mottie1> hey, I don't know that much about mobile... just thought I'd ask
[12:26:20] <Phoenixz> Mottie1: You were'nt kidding....
[12:26:41] <Phoenixz> Mottie1: seriously, thanks, this prevented some bloody murders here :) its working
[12:26:52] <Mottie1> LOL glad I could help :P
[12:26:55] <Phoenixz> This just *might* be something they would like to add to the documentation, just maybe??
[12:28:47] <Zeeshan_M> haha
[12:29:07] <Phoenixz> Yes, confirmed, its jQuery 1.3.0-beta.1 that does it.. No mention about it in the documentation though, great!
[12:29:46] <systemfault> Oh shit :/
[12:29:59] <Phoenixz> Since latest stable version is 1.2.0, this might really be the kind of tiny detail that people would add to the documentation?
[12:30:10] <Phoenixz> Im ranting :) I know..
[12:32:59] <lordn_n> Thanks Mottie1 you avoid that he killed me
[12:38:44] <fs__> stil here
[12:38:59] <Phoenixz> fs__: waiting for something?
[12:39:16] <Phoenixz> lordn_n: "here" as in my office :)
[12:39:23] <Phoenixz> Thanks for the help all
[12:40:02] <fs__> Phoenixz: well... just tried out jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/rvs1977/2rwX3/7/ maybe you can help me
[12:42:02] <fs__> Phoenixz: It should not say "null" when draggin the tab, but instead the Id of the tab
[12:44:41] <fs__> Phoenixz have you tried it out?
[12:45:11] <shoky> fs__: the option is 'active', not 'selected'
[12:47:51] <fs__> shoky Im new here... how do I write so you will be noticed
[12:48:23] <shoky> i can see what you write..
[12:49:10] <fs__> shoky: when using active it gives a result, but it dont show the id of the selected tab
[12:49:31] <shoky> right

[13:02:28] <fs__> shoky> you dont think it will work with 1.10?
[13:02:57] <shoky> fs__: we just saw it wont..
[13:03:31] <fs__> shoky: well I could try and change to 1.8 then
[13:04:05] <shoky> fs__:  or use 'active' .. ?

[13:12:06] <TiffanyAmber_> I've read every doc there is to be read about reg
[13:12:15] <shoky> it returns an array..
[13:12:22] <TiffanyAmber_> and still, it must be one of these things so simple it escapes me ;-(((
[13:12:38] <TiffanyAmber_> I just want id=29 no id=29,29
[13:13:07] <shoky> TiffanyAmber_: anything in parentheses ()  will be added to the array too

[13:13:11] <dp> shoky: thanks
[13:13:27] <shoky> TiffanyAmber_:  just take [0] from the array

[13:14:04] <TiffanyAmber_> shoky: THANKS
[13:14:21] <TiffanyAmber_> I was on the javascript chat and somehow they refused to help me on this one. Thanks mate ;-))))
[13:14:27] <TiffanyAmber_> was so simple
[13:14:31] <TiffanyAmber_> I can learn a lot from this
[13:23:12] <superdmp> I have some JS here with a function: InlineOrdering.getOrderables() - can I put that into a window.alert() to see what it's returning? what attribute of InlineOrdering.getOrderables() do I need to ask for?
[13:23:23] <stemid> having some issues with post in this jquery function that starts on line 26 here http://pastebin.com/WEb2zvak I get 0 data length back but when I do it with curl --data '' http://url everything works. tcpdump shows no query after the request, as if my second argument to $.post() is not working. console.log just before shows the values are filled in.
[13:23:39] <superdmp> InlineOrdering.getOrderables() itself returns [object Object] which is not so informative
[13:25:17] <djQuery> does $(this).remove() no longer work?
[13:25:43] <djQuery> looping through some inputs and removing the ones that have no value
[13:34:35] <BillCriswell> djQuery: I sure hope it still works lol.
[13:34:43] <BillCriswell> Is this what you think it is?
[13:35:10] <djQuery> BillCriswell, I got the issue I was having resolved
[13:35:22] <BillCriswell> Phew.
[13:35:51] <BillCriswell> 25MB CSV's make me nervous.
[13:36:28] <djQuery> BillCriswell, ?
[13:36:35] <BillCriswell> Just saying.
[13:37:45] <djQuery> BillCriswell, whos using a csv?
[13:38:00] <BillCriswell> This person who just emailed me.
[13:38:04] <djQuery> lol
[13:38:19] <djQuery> well at least its a csv and not some pdf
[13:38:30] <BillCriswell> yeah, true
[13:38:53] <djQuery> cant hide much code in a csv
[13:39:09] <djQuery> well unless you open it with some crap like excel
[13:39:15] <BillCriswell> djQuery: This guy did. Lots of bad HTML. =(
[13:39:37] <alaing> can you store a function in .data()?
[13:40:12] <BillCriswell> alaing: As a string maybe, then use eval()... This comment might cause a ruckus.
[13:40:34] <BillCriswell> Sounds a bit weird that you'd have to, though.
[13:41:06] <alaing> Yeah on secon though I'll just store it in a variable
[13:41:11] <djQuery> you can store the function as a custom event cant you ? then you can just trigger the custom event
[13:41:36] <BillCriswell> A bunch of sorcery.
[13:41:44] <alaing> lol
[13:42:11] <alaing> whats the best way to delay some code until another piece has finished
[13:42:20] <alaing> using setTimeOut?
[13:42:22] <djQuery> $('#mywhatever').bind('mycustomevent', function(){console.log('triggered')})
[13:42:39] <BillCriswell> alaing: Depending on the code you can put it right under it.
[13:42:44] <djQuery> ?callback@alaing
[13:42:45] <bot-t> alaing, jQuery.Callbacks() | jQuery API Documentation - A multi-purpose callbacks list object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[13:42:47] <BillCriswell> If it's async you'd need to use a callback.
[13:43:21] <alaing> thanks BillCriswell I'll take a look through that
[13:43:41] <djQuery> using setTimeout if there where an error in the thing that you were waiting on you wouldnt be quanteed that it was finished or what not
[13:43:44] <aaas> anyone want to look at my code: http://jsfiddle.net/eqsGS/   ... im not sure why my '20 million' goes to two lines
[13:43:48] <alaing> djQuery: didn't think of using custom events. thank you for the suggestion
[13:43:56] <tueson> Which is more performant:  $someDiv.find('.manyCheckboxes').prop('disabled', true);   OR  $someDiv.find('.manyCheckboxes').each(function() { var $this = $(this);  $this.prop('disabled', true); });  ?
[13:44:02] <BillCriswell> alaing: Are you waiting for an ajax request to complete?
[13:44:09] <alaing> no
[13:44:17] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:44:21] <alaing> just for a function to run before carrying on with a bit of code
[13:45:05] <BillCriswell> tueson: I'd put my money on the first being the better performing.. but I doubt it's a huge difference.
[13:45:39] <djQuery> alaing, let me know if it works as that was just off the top of my head
[13:46:03] <systemfault> I'd say the first would be more performant… Not sure how important it is though.
[13:46:59] <djQuery> isnt the first just going to do the 2nd internaly?
[13:47:24] <tueson> djQuery: that's what I'm thinking too, which is why I think it may be slower
[13:47:26] <tueson> making a perf now
[13:48:01] <djQuery> but I think the first is more readable and I realy doubt the performance difference will be noticable
[13:48:15] <djQuery> so go for readability over performance in this case
[13:48:50] <hashpuppy> what's a good autocomplete plugin?  i see jquery ui, marco polo, and jquery-autocomplete.  are there any others?
[13:49:22] <Mottie1> hashpuppy: Bootstrap has one too, it's not called autocomplete
[13:49:36] <djQuery> I realy like the jquery-ui one. It seems pretty feature complete. but a little heavy if you are only using the autocomplete
[13:49:39] <tueson> I actually think the second one is more readable since you expect there to be more than 1 result
[13:50:09] <stevecrozz> I seem to get jqxhr.status == 0 when I abort a request, can I use that to reliably detect an aborted request? Or can that mean something else?
[13:50:13] <hashpuppy> thanks, guys
[13:50:47] <BillCriswell> tueson: I disagree, but whatever floats your boat.
[13:51:34] <tueson> Hmm
[13:51:37] <djQuery> hashpuppy, although jquerry ui does have modular download available to where you only grab the autocomplete widget. BUT I like to use the CDNs that available instead
[13:52:06] <hashpuppy> i also need the date picker, so it's not that big of a deal
[13:52:11] <djQuery> BillCriswell, tueson   if you are familar with jquery the first is more readable, if you only know javascript then the 2nd
[13:52:20] <aaas> when my 'max-label' buts up against the right hand side of the containing elment it goes to 2 lines: http://jsfiddle.net/eqsGS/   ..any way to avoid this?
[13:52:54] <tueson> The first one is about 40% faster
[13:52:56] <tueson> interesting
[13:53:09] <tueson> Guess I'll change the way I read lol
[13:53:51] <djQuery> aaas, not realy a jquery issue is it? more of a css thing
[13:53:57] <BillCriswell> tueson: I just assume jquery has built in neatness to keep my code looking pretty and efficient.
[13:54:11] <BillCriswell> to keep it so my code can look pretty and efficient*
[13:54:20] <aaas> djQuery i guess your'e right, thanks
[13:54:41] <tueson> BillCriswell: but I only suspect it is faster if you use the $(this) in the inner function only once.
[13:54:57] <djQuery> aaas, but sorry dont know, maybe surrond those with labels and turn off white space inside of those labels
[13:55:32] <aaas> djQuery with labels?
[13:55:49] <djQuery> or spans or divs or whatever floats your boat
[13:56:40] <djQuery> just wrap the text in something then turn off white space breaking inside of that something
[13:56:54] <systemfault> tueson: It's logic… the first one probably does a loop with .prop while the second one have an overhead of an extra function call for every element.
[13:57:06] <aaas> djQuery yes if I remove the whitespace it solves it, but I need the whitespace there
[13:57:11] <tueson> http://jsperf.com/no-each-vs-each-vs-each2-vs-quickeach  - this is funny
[13:57:23] <tueson> (not complete yet)
[13:58:15] <djQuery> aaas, I forget the css attribute but there is one to tell it what kinda of characters to break on. not actualy remove the space but tell it to no longer wrap to a new line on the space
[13:58:29] <aaas> djQuery ok thanks ill look into it
[13:58:48] <djQuery> its been at least 3 years since I needed that
[13:59:23] <djQuery> or just set the width of the label to 50% so that there is room for the text
[13:59:41] <BillCriswell> white-wrap: pre or someshit.
[13:59:46] <aaas> djQuery white-space:nowrap seems to work thanks... i just hope this is the best way to do it ;)
[13:59:52] <BillCriswell> white-space:
[14:00:18] <BillCriswell> aaas: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/whitespace.html
[14:00:37] <aaas> BillCriswell thanks
[14:01:00] <djQuery> tueson, test isnt valid, 2nd test has a lot of overhead that first doesnt have
[14:03:21] <tueson> djQuery: fixed
[14:04:42] <djQuery> tueson, http://jsperf.com/no-each-vs-each-vs-each2-vs-quickeach/3
[14:04:50] <djQuery> chaining is actualy slower?
[14:04:57] <djQuery> not much but still
[14:06:30] <systemfault> internal each is the fastest here..
[14:07:00] <djQuery> tueson, last one time for work http://jsperf.com/no-each-vs-each-vs-each2-vs-quickeach/4
[14:07:09] * djQuery crap time for work
[14:07:38] <Leif_Bork> How do I reinitialize jquery after dynamically loading html into elements?
[14:11:35] <BillCriswell> Leif_Bork: You don't have to, just run it on the elements after they're inserted.
[14:13:48] <Leif_Bork> BillCriswell: Hm, thank you
[14:14:17] <brombomb-w> I'm making my own jquery Widget, and I have a public method "mute".  I can successfully call $('#id').videoplayer("mute")  but error when I try $('#id').videoplayer().mute()   Any thoughts?
[14:15:07] <systemfault> brombomb-w: What does the .videoplayer() method returns?
[14:15:49] <brombomb-w> $.widget('my.videoPlayer', .... })( jQuery);
[14:15:59] <brombomb-w> the standard jquery widgetFactory template
[14:16:30] <systemfault> And that object has a .mute method?
[14:16:51] <brombomb-w> it has a "public" mthod mute
[14:17:15] <brombomb-w> which works when called as .videoPlayer("mute")
[14:17:26] <brombomb-w> but not .videoPlayer().mute()
[14:21:50] <aaas> if anyone isn't busy and has any suggestions on how my code could be written better id appreaciate it http://jsfiddle.net/rvYZh/ .... or if you have any resources (books,sites,etc) or suggested practices that a neophyte jquery programmer should use/research to write jquerry code better Id appreaciate it
[14:23:19] <brombomb-w> I guess you have to use the data proiperty to access those methods directly
[14:24:09] <asidjazz> i have a class .status and .status_active both have transiton: top 0.5s linear status is top: -50px, .status_active is top: 0px .. when i add status_active to status.. the animation is fine.. but then when i remove .status_active.. animation doesnt occur
[14:28:09] <nesoi> hello... can someone look at this and tell me why it doesn't work? I'm trying to learn jquery and this is just a sample. It doesn't render:
[14:28:10] <nesoi> http://pastie.org/private/dkt4dt0nkwieac3gbasxdw#11
[14:28:19] <nesoi> I have all the files in the same directory as index.html
[14:29:28] <someprimetime> yo i need some feedback on a plugin
[14:29:47] <someprimetime> paging Eviltwin shoky etc
[14:29:53] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/nHSt4/5/
[14:30:00] <someprimetime> where can I improve this?
[14:33:08] <nesoi> someprimetime : can you look at this http://pastie.org/private/dkt4dt0nkwieac3gbasxdw#11 I'm a rank beginner and even my cut and paste example isn't workiung
[14:33:08] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Allow options to be passed in that controls the resulting behavior
[14:33:10] <nesoi> working
[14:33:17] <nesoi> or Eviltwin
[14:33:26] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what kind of options, behavior, etc?
[14:33:35] <someprimetime> checkboxes instead maybe?
[14:33:37] <someprimetime> s/instead/also
[14:33:53] <someprimetime> nesoi: what exactly am I looking at?
[14:33:54] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Well for one thing I see: $icon.text('Checked')
[14:34:02] <someprimetime> yeah that's getting replaced with an icon
[14:34:04] <Eviltwin> That should be configurable
[14:34:10] <someprimetime> good point
[14:34:20] <someprimetime> that'll be toggleClass most likely
[14:34:28] <Eviltwin> It might also be nice to have two callbacks / events
[14:34:36] <Eviltwin> Like check and uncheck or something
[14:34:38] <nesoi> someprimetime : I'm just trying to see how an example for this list will look, and instead it doesn't render at all
[14:34:43] <nesoi> I see plain HTML
[14:34:44] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: thanks
[14:34:45] <Eviltwin> Allow them to optionally override the behavior with a function
[14:35:00] <nesoi> all the files are in the same directory, so it should work, I thought
[14:35:03] <nesoi> what am I doing wrong?
[14:35:09] <someprimetime> nesoi: well for one I see no javascript
[14:35:25] <nesoi> it looks the same as the example though
[14:36:02] <someprimetime>         <script src="jquery.mobile-1.2.0.js"></script> =>         <script  type="text/javascript" src="jquery.mobile-1.2.0.js"></script> maybe?
[14:36:10] <nesoi> that's there
[14:36:16] <someprimetime> type?
[14:36:26] <someprimetime> although I'm not sure if that's even required anymore
[14:36:28] <nesoi> you don't need type
[14:36:30] <Eviltwin> (Technically the type does nothing)
[14:36:40] <someprimetime> it should work if everything is in the same directory then?
[14:36:41] <nesoi> it has <link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery.mobile-1.2.0.css" />
[14:36:41] <nesoi> <script src="jquery-1.9.0.js"></script>
[14:36:42] <nesoi> <script src="jquery.mobile-1.2.0.js"></script>
[14:36:51] <nesoi> yes but it doesn't work, so what's wrong?
[14:38:47] <nesoi> no hints?
[14:39:01] <nesoi> oops have to run... bbl
[14:44:18] <Mottie1> actually you should be using $('#id').videoplayer()[0].mute();
[14:44:59] <Mottie1> oops I'm a little behind LOL
[14:47:31] <scriptraptor> is there a jquery method to test if an animation is complete?
[14:47:55] <scriptraptor> var x = this.slideUp(); if (x.finished) { } etc
[14:47:58] <coldhead> ?:animated
[14:47:59] <bot-t> :animated: Select all elements that are in the progress of an animation at the time the selector is run. http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[14:48:10] <coldhead> $(thing).is(':animated')
[14:48:34] <scriptraptor> how do i get it once it's run, instead of a callback?
[14:49:04] <coldhead> do you maybe want to use the callback that runs when an animation is finished?
[14:49:16] <someprimetime> there sis a complete option for animate
[14:49:20] <coldhead> $(thing).slideUp(function () {alert('finished');})
[14:49:21] <scriptraptor> callback won't work in this situation, i need to emulate a callback
[14:49:38] <someprimetime> s/sis/is
[14:50:03] <scriptraptor> someprimetime: how do i do that? if x.complete() {}?
[14:51:13] <someprimetime> scriptraptor: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407592/jquery-event-order-and-waiting-till-animation-complete#answer-3389213
[14:52:39] <scriptraptor> someprimetime: that's still a callback?
[14:52:50] <someprimetime> pretty much
[14:53:03] <someprimetime> i mean you could  use is(':animated') i think
[14:53:12] <someprimetime> http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[14:53:20] <someprimetime> don't really know what you're trying to do
[14:53:39] <coldhead> it's all very mysterious
[14:53:58] <Mottie1> scriptaraptor: why won't a callback work?
[14:54:00] <someprimetime> nice looks like jquery.com finally updated the main page
[14:54:15] <someprimetime> was still on the old one earlier today
[14:54:18] <someprimetime> so +1 to whoever did that
[14:54:30] <Mottie1> someprimetime: they updated the blog too
[14:54:50] <someprimetime> blogs? aint nobody got time for that
[14:55:02] <Mottie1> lol
[14:55:09] <Mottie1> I mean the jquery blog... http://blog.jquery.com/
[14:55:17] <scriptraptor> :animated finds what is currently being animated it seems, i just want to continue doc flow once the animation is done
[14:55:44] <someprimetime> Mottie1: i know :) just being facetious
[14:56:23] <someprimetime> looks like there is an overflow issue on the article container on the blog rather .listing .hentry
[14:56:41] <someprimetime> gtg ttyl
[14:57:58] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, someprimetime
[14:58:57] <Mottie1> you'll need to break up your javascript so that it "continues" after the animation?
[14:59:17] <scriptraptor> Mottie1: can you elaborate
[14:59:43] <Mottie1> I mean you'll need to break up the code
[14:59:59] <Mottie1> coldhead: $(thing).slideUp(function () { continue(); })
[15:00:19] <Mottie1> then in function continue(){ /* keep going */ }
[15:00:25] <Faralla> hi. I having a problem with jquerymobile: I have a form in a popup, before sending i want to check the field values. but wether or not i return false in onsubmit, the popup always closes and redirects to the first page. Any hints on that?
[15:00:49] <scriptraptor> Mottie1: PITA but i did find something: $obj.promise().done(function() {})
[15:01:52] <jjb123> Hey everyone, quick question. I'm using .ajax to fetch a JSON page. I have to use JSONP because it is a cross domain request. JQuery correctly parses the response JSON into an array, however I need the raw text (which I can't seem to get when using JSONP). Any ideas? I all ready tried data.responseText.
[15:01:56] <jjb123> Here is my javascript: http://pastebin.com/bTZLfs3C
[15:04:27] <systemfault> Have you verified the content of "data"?
[15:04:43] <systemfault> Not with a stupid alert like noobs..
[15:06:38] <x0rcist> Hey guys I need help
[15:06:47] <x0rcist> I need to grab a value from a twitter json response.
[15:06:51] <Mottie1> I'm pretty sure that setting the dataType to jsonp, it automatically parses the data
[15:07:03] <x0rcist> I need to grab the media_url from a tag
[15:07:04] <x0rcist> http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=dress&rpp=20&include_entities=true&callback=?
[15:07:04] <asidjazz> can anyone tell me why this doesnt animate back up? http://jsfiddle.net/GkDmy/4/
[15:07:48] <Mottie1> x0rcist: what have you tried?
[15:08:17] <x0rcist> Heres' the code one sec.
[15:08:29] <x0rcist> http://pastie.org/5839830
[15:09:04] <x0rcist> What I need to grab though is an item under "entities" and "media" I believe, based on the above twitter search url
[15:10:17] <jjb123> systemfault: Yep, I did. It's a valid JSON object
[15:10:50] <jjb123> systemfault: I just want a way to get the raw text response (while still using the JSONP datatype, which is required for the cross domain access)
[15:10:52] <asidjazz> can anyone tell me why this doesnt animate back up? http://jsfiddle.net/GkDmy/4/
[15:10:52] <x0rcist> If you go to jsonprettyprint.com and past the code from that - you'll see that
[15:10:56] <Mottie1> jjb123: I'm pretty sure that setting the dataType to jsonp, it automatically parses the data... maybe you can do a data.toString()
[15:11:17] <systemfault> Mottie1: That's right, it parses the string
[15:11:55] <x0rcist> data.results.entities.media.media_url right?
[15:12:03] <jjb123> Mottie1: Ah, that's what I was afraid of. Just to make sure, it's impossible to use ajax to get a cross domain response without using JSONP right (even text/html)?
[15:12:08] <systemfault> jjb123: jsonp is a hack, you can't get anything but a JS object from it.
[15:12:36] <systemfault> jjb123: Only if you don't need to support older browsers and you can do server-side modifications.
[15:12:45] <systemfault> jjb123: If you can, take a look at CORS
[15:13:11] <x0rcist> weird
[15:13:13] <x0rcist> it works guys
[15:13:14] <x0rcist> BUT
[15:13:16] <Mottie1> x0rcist: nope, there are arrays in there... you'll need something like data.results[0].entries.media[0].media_url... but the [0] aren't right
[15:13:16] <x0rcist> 		      $("<img/>").attr("src", item.entities.media[i].media_url).appendTo("#images");
[15:13:27] <jjb123> systemfault: Cool thanks, I'll research this. Is there some way to convert the JSON object back into a string?
[15:13:37] <x0rcist> That pulls just one image - it dies because if there isn't a media_url is causes an error
[15:13:58] <x0rcist> maybe I'll do a check to see if a var is set or not and if it isnt ill set a default
[15:14:10] <x0rcist> But I'd like to remove any item/result that doesn't have a media_url attached.
[15:14:11] <Mottie1> x0rcist: you'll need to detect if an "entries" has a "media" object, then detect if "media" has a "media_url"
[15:14:13] <x0rcist> Any clue how to do that?
[15:14:32] <Mottie1> entries.hasOwnProperty(media)
[15:15:02] <Mottie1> or just an if (entries.media) {}
[15:16:04] <systemfault> jjb123: Sure.. with JSON.stringify, not sure why you would do that though :/
[15:16:24] <scriptraptor> does $obj.removeClass() need you to if ($obj.hasClass(x)) {} first?
[15:17:01] <systemfault> scriptraptor: no
[15:17:08] <scriptraptor> systemfault: good to know, thanks
[15:18:23] <x0rcist> Mottiel
[15:18:28] <Mottie1> ?
[15:18:31] <x0rcist> It works every X amount of page refreshes
[15:18:42] <x0rcist> 			if(item.entities.media[i].media_url != null) {
[15:18:52] <x0rcist> else return true
[15:19:22] <x0rcist> But it appears that unless I refresh the page a few times, it won't give me the picture - it doesn't appear that it's checking recursively properly
[15:21:02] <Mottie1> you need to check it like this: if (results.entities && results.entities.media && results.entities.media[i].media_url) { /* do something */ }
[15:21:19] <x0rcist> ok one sec.
[15:22:23] <x0rcist> after changing it
[15:22:30] <x0rcist> it still only shows a single picture, and only sometimes.
[15:22:38] <gnarf> why are you digging that deep into an object that late in the code?
[15:22:38] <Mottie1> are you getting any errors?
[15:22:52] <Mottie1> it's a json feed
[15:22:55] <x0rcist> No errors here's the pastie now. sec
[15:23:03] <Mottie1> twitter json feed
[15:23:04] <x0rcist> http://pastie.org/5839891
[15:23:10] <x0rcist> link to feed
[15:23:11] <x0rcist> http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=dress&rpp=20&include_entities=true&callback=?
[15:23:37] <x0rcist> if you put that json into http://jsonprettyprint.com/ - it shows you that it should be referencing properly
[15:24:28] <tueson> djQuery: Interesting alternatives
[15:24:45] <tueson> I'm actually very surprised at how jQuery's internal each performs
[15:25:00] <gnarf> so media itself is an array x0rcist
[15:26:02] <gnarf> you'd want to $.each( item.entities.media || [], function( index, media ) { ... media.expanded_url } ); right?
[15:26:20] <x0rcist> I dont want expanded url
[15:26:23] <gnarf> x0rcist: thats what i meant about digging deep ^^^ at some point you should rename one of these things
[15:26:29] <x0rcist> I need "media_url" under "media" under "entities"
[15:26:37] <gnarf> then use media_url
[15:26:41] <gnarf> your pastie had expanded
[15:26:43] <gnarf> i copied
[15:27:08] <gnarf> you want to each over the item.entities.media and add images, yes?
[15:27:19] <gnarf> or do you only want the first one?
[15:27:31] <x0rcist> back in a moment thank you all. I need any "media_url" entity in the whole json feed
[15:27:33] <gnarf> in which case you should use [0] instead of [i] in your pastie
[15:28:10] <gnarf> tueson: ?
[15:28:36] <tueson> gnarf: http://jsperf.com/no-each-vs-each-vs-each2-vs-quickeach/3 and http://jsperf.com/no-each-vs-each-vs-each2-vs-quickeach/4
[15:29:56] <systemfault> tueson: They're stupidly obvious results..
[15:30:50] <tueson> Not for me, guess I'm stupid :(
[15:31:29] <systemfault> tueson: In all but the first test case, you have X extra function calls (The closure being called)
[15:31:33] <gnarf> its about number of functions calss
[15:31:48] <gnarf> because the .prop() itself calls .each()
[15:31:57] <gnarf> so .each() calls .prop() calls .each()
[15:32:02] <gnarf> in the second one
[15:32:02] <gnarf> etc
[15:32:07] <tueson> Oh
[15:32:19] <Mottie1> x0rcist: Here... http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/gJSCT/
[15:32:28] <tueson> Yes then that is stupidly obvious.  Woops.
[15:33:06] <foo> How can I iterate through text input types based on name="namehere" within <input type="text"...>
[15:33:10] <gnarf> we've been debating exposing the iterator functions too
[15:33:24] <gnarf> so that you can call prop on a single element very easily
[15:33:33] <gnarf> or at least i've been debating it
[15:33:42] <gnarf> would let us do some things with composing, etc
[15:34:27] <tueson> That would be cool
[15:34:48] <foo> How can I iterate through text input types based on name="namehere" within <input type="text"...>
[15:35:48] <Mottie1> asidjazz: you still there?... try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/GkDmy/6/
[15:36:47] <asidjazz> Mottie1: thanks.. my only problem w/ that is it forces 'all'
[15:37:01] <asidjazz> Mottie1: im also moving this divs left position drastically to center it.. and i dont want that animated
[15:37:16] <akkufomk> foo: $('[name=thename]').each(function () {  do something here for each textbox });
[15:38:26] <systemfault> tueson: For fun, I added two extra testcases: http://jsperf.com/no-each-vs-each-vs-each2-vs-quickeach/5
[15:38:28] <TelFiRE> IDK if this is just a straight CSS issue or something to do with the jQuery, but I have a prob with IE7. I have a span inside a li that is default to opacity 0 but changes to opacity 100 on li:hover span. But then a jquery animation fires and when that happens, the arrow disappears. I'm using hoverintent and if you hover out and then back in fast enough that it doesn't go away, you can see the arrow once again. Any ideas?
[15:38:55] <MrPunkin> Guys, I'm looking for the best way to prepend content before the viewport area without the user having a jolt in what is in their viewport. Any suggestions?
[15:39:47] <TelFiRE> can you have the element exist in markup
[15:39:57] <Mottie1> asicjazz: "all" only applies to the modified tags... so in the active you're only changing opacity and top
[15:40:25] <TelFiRE> I would say just have it be created at opacity or height 0 and then fade or slide it in.
[15:40:36] <TelFiRE> sort of depends on the situation
[15:41:02] <gnarf> foo: $("input[name='namehere'][type='text']") ?
[15:41:14] <foo> gnarf: aha, that works too. tahnks!
[15:41:16] <foo> thanks *
[15:43:17] <tueson> systemfault: nice
[15:45:01] <TelFiRE> man IE is so unreliable
[15:45:45] <systemfault> ie9 and later :P are accetable
[15:45:49] <systemfault> *acceptable even
[15:46:06] <ldlework> Hey anyone familiar with layout.js?
[15:46:28] <systemfault> To be honest, if it wasn't of IE, I'd probably not need to use jQuery :P
[15:49:39] <foo> TelFiRE: I call upon this: http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18camj2qheoagjpg/original.jpg
[15:50:06] <TelFiRE> ROFL
[15:50:09] <TelFiRE> that's hilarious

[15:50:38] <coldhead> Mottie1++
[15:50:44] <x0rcist> The question becomes: are there just not a lot of images in that feed?
[15:54:59] <Mottie1> x0rcist: you're welcome :)
[15:55:21] <Mottie1> it updates every time you refresh
[15:55:30] <Mottie1> sometimes I see 2, other times I see 5
[15:55:49] <x0rcist> Weird; I need it to pull that json and show all that return
[15:57:43] <x0rcist> Obviously, it's changing each query;
[15:58:00] <x0rcist> But the final hashtag/term I'm searching on should have a set number
[15:59:06] <Mottie1> rpp is the number of tweets, not every one has an image
[15:59:38] <Mottie1> https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search#api-param-search_rpp
[16:00:34] <x0rcist> When I looked for #catpics it shows a ton
[16:01:48] <Mottie1> go to the feed (http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=cat&rpp=50&include_entities=true&callback=?), then search for (ctrl-f) "media_url"... I just found 6
[16:02:17] <raj> shoky?
[16:03:37] <x0rcist> 		$.getJSON("http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=%23funnypics&rpp=100&include_entities=true&callback=?"
[16:03:44] <x0rcist> my rpp is 100
[16:03:50] <x0rcist> but it's only showing 15
[16:03:58] <x0rcist> and there are like 34 returned
[16:05:08] <tueson> Mottie1: that's so jokes
[16:05:43] <Mottie1> there is a "media_url" and "media_url_https" in the json feed
[16:05:52] <Mottie1> so divide that by 2
[16:06:07] <x0rcist> :)
[16:06:50] <Mottie1> so put quotes around it when you search LOL.. "media_url"
[16:07:07] <starsinmypockets> Hmm.. looking for a way to sort elements by a data attribute...
[16:07:19] <x0rcist> ;) I did
[16:07:19] <x0rcist> lol
[16:07:26] <x0rcist> Thanks for all of your help
[16:07:53] <Mottie1> oh you know what
[16:08:03] <Mottie1> sometimes people post more than one... gimme a sec
[16:09:50] <Mottie1> http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/gJSCT/2/
[16:10:17] <MrPunkin> Whats the best way to get all items from array B that don't exist in array A?
[16:11:27] <pinholecamera> hey folks, how goes?
[16:12:05] <pinholecamera> i'm trying to use the live() method to bind a click event to a div instead of the click() method. for some reason it tells me "Object has no method "live", i have no idea why.
[16:12:16] <pinholecamera> the DIV is in the dom, and responds to .click() just fine.
[16:12:30] <pinholecamera> i put together this simplified example to show: http://pastebin.com/WgVefKZa
[16:12:39] <pinholecamera> i've definitely used .live() before so not sure what's going on
[16:12:43] <coldhead> live is deprecated
[16:12:48] <coldhead> and was removed in jquery 1.9
[16:12:53] <coldhead> if that's what you're using
[16:13:12] <pinholecamera> aha! that'll do it. i am using 1.9.
[16:13:20] <systemfault> Everything was bad with that function :P
[16:13:26] <systemfault> Even its name.
[16:13:33] <pinholecamera> systemfault: yeah, it's ambiguous
[16:13:44] <coldhead> i liked that it could be undone with die()
[16:13:48] <pinholecamera> haha
[16:13:50] <coldhead> that was a stress reliever
[16:13:54] <coldhead> i felt like a god
[16:14:07] <systemfault> :P
[16:14:16] <pinholecamera> well, essentially i was using .click() but i noticed that when i .hide() and then .show() the element again the click method doesn't really work
[16:14:32] <coldhead> you probably want to use ?on instead
[16:14:32] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:14:44] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[16:14:45] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[16:15:11] <pinholecamera> thanks coldhead
[16:15:25] <Fenikkusu> Can someone give me their thoughts on this: http://jsfiddle.net/rXfxk/ IE: Am I heading in the right direction, should I be using a different method? Etc. The goal is to have a small ui framework combined with a straight plugin in which other plugins can extend.
[16:17:54] <pinholecamera> aha, it's not actually the click handler that's not working apparently
[16:19:19] <pinholecamera> i'm using the html5 responsive boilerplate to build out this responsive site... for some reason when you resize the window it no longer executes the animate() commands i've got in my click event
[16:19:25] <pinholecamera> that is interesting
[16:19:44] <coldhead> weird
[16:20:29] <pinholecamera> yeah. anything else like console.log(), etc, it executes just fine
[16:21:13] <pinholecamera> weird..... apparently it does execute it but it takes a minute to fire instead of the 500 milliseconds
[16:21:22] <pinholecamera> that sounds like some sort of unfortunate bug,
[16:21:51] <coldhead> can you get it online somewhere to demo?
[16:22:19] <pinholecamera> definitely, uploading now
[16:23:31] <pinholecamera> coldhead: so if you look at it as a regular sized browser window it doesn't display this button on the top right of the layout... http://terrorbird.com/responsive/
[16:23:58] <pinholecamera> coldhead: but if you make the width smaller it'll kick into tablet/mobile mode and hide the menu
[16:24:11] <coldhead> yus
[16:24:19] <pinholecamera> coldhead: i guess if you resize before you click it doesn't work... but if you load it as mobile/tablet it works
[16:24:42] <pinholecamera> coldhead: or if you load it as mobile/tablet and then resize after it stops working, or rather happens a minute later
[16:24:42] <coldhead> it works for me after a resize
[16:24:44] <coldhead> straight away
[16:24:48] <pinholecamera> huh, what browser?
[16:24:55] <coldhead> chromium 24 or so
[16:25:09] <pinholecamera> huh, i'm on 25
[16:25:25] <coldhead> getting ahead of myself, 23
[16:25:32] <pinholecamera> doesn't work on firefox either
[16:25:42] <pinholecamera> or rather, it works like i described
[16:25:43] <pinholecamera> hrmm
[16:26:02] <pinholecamera> FF 17
[16:26:07] <coldhead> works for me in an ancient firefox too
[16:26:16] <pinholecamera> that's interesting
[16:26:37] <coldhead> i don't have a tablet here to test with
[16:26:40] <pinholecamera> it works after resize on opera
[16:27:00] <pinholecamera> i mean i don't reckon a lot of people will be resizing like this
[16:27:01] <coldhead> what OS are you on?
[16:27:07] <pinholecamera> OSX snow leopard
[16:27:44] <pinholecamera> will give it another shot on my ipad and phone
[16:27:54] <coldhead> aha! i can reproduce it on os x
[16:28:11] <coldhead> deeply weird
[16:29:26] <pinholecamera> indeed. that shouldn't really make a difference in this day and age
[16:29:56] <coldhead> i would guess it relates to this promise().done() thing you have
[16:30:08] <coldhead> does it work if you remove that?
[16:30:20] <pinholecamera> works okay after a resize on my android phone
[16:30:28] <pinholecamera> well, i actually took that all out and switched back to click()
[16:30:28] <coldhead> i am unfamiliar with creating a promise and doning it immediately
[16:31:39] <pinholecamera> so rather http://pastebin.com/innze8BJ as opposed to the promise().done() bit
[16:31:57] <pinholecamera> i'm sort of tempted to drop jquery down to a lower version since i've never seen this before
[16:32:58] <coldhead> watever works
[16:33:07] <coldhead> no shame in the classic jqueries of yore
[16:33:29] <coldhead> i would create the hidden nav stuff prior to the click, unconditionally
[16:33:42] <coldhead> and just have it hidden on the page in all cases
[16:33:50] <pinholecamera> coldhead: yeah, just always have it there... it makes sense, less time to wait
[16:33:52] <coldhead> just to simplify the click handler
[16:36:08] <pinholecamera> it's interesting, the error occurs only when the button disappears and reappears again
[16:36:37] <pinholecamera> so i almost wonder if it's just taking the browser longer to look through the DOM when it comes back
[16:37:14] <pinholecamera> i'll try visibility hidden instead of display: none i guess... that button shouldn't hurt anyone taking up space there
[16:39:15] <pinholecamera> i guess that's still not it though, it's something to do with the stuff it's targeting, not the button itself
[16:39:42] <pinholecamera> once the container div moves down after that protracted time, the button works perfectly fine again
[16:40:49] <tueson> Are interns applying for front-end positions expected to know the difference between a class and an id?
[16:41:19] <pinholecamera> aha, i see what's doing it, but not why
[16:42:48] <pinholecamera> coldhead: if i take out this animate bit that fires when you're resizing the screen, it all works fine: http://pastebin.com/2rpm5CeM
[16:43:05] <pinholecamera> coldhead: the $(".container").animate({ top: '0px' }); bit
[16:43:30] <pinholecamera> coldhead: so my guess is that some browsers aren't completing that fast enough, or it's making something stick in memory
[16:43:34] <coldhead> tueson: they should if they have any hope
[16:43:55] <coldhead> pinholecamera: that makes sense
[16:43:55] <tueson> I've went through 8 so far who didn't
[16:44:16] <coldhead> tueson: idiots! it's not like it's secret information you need a PHD to understand
[16:44:23] <tueson> haha
[16:44:44] <tueson> Now people at work think I'm too anal about hiring... little do they know...
[16:44:52] <coldhead> i am teaching a front-end class tonight on that very subject, i might borrow your anecdote
[16:45:19] <coldhead> "learn this and you will have a better chance of a job than these 8 jerks i read about on IRC"
[16:45:25] <tueson> hahaha
[16:45:40] <tueson> Want my interview questions?
[16:45:48] <coldhead> sure!
[16:45:50] <tueson> If they memorize them they'd be better programmers
[16:46:24] <pinholecamera> coldhead: i guess the answer to this question is, screw the snazzy animation.
[16:46:53] <coldhead> pinholecamera: or use the animation callback to prevent the code running until the animation completes?
[16:47:17] <pinholecamera> coldhead: that's true
[16:47:40] <coldhead> people like animations
[16:48:08] <pinholecamera> also true
[16:50:28] <tds5016> hi. what is the correct syntax for attaching a handler to the user hovering their mouse over something?
[16:53:28] <tds5016> bueler?
[16:53:29] <tds5016> :-)
[16:54:31] <raj> coldhead, is it dangerous to save the sockjs session id to a cookie?
[16:54:46] <coldhead> it sounds dangerous, raj
[16:54:50] <raj> why?
[16:54:57] <raj> the person could change it
[16:55:18] <coldhead> tds5016: $(thing).hover(function () {$(this)toggleClass('hovered');});
[16:55:45] <coldhead> wouldn't it also mean that the sessionid is sent to the server with every subsequent request?
[16:55:48] <coldhead> packet sniffing etc
[16:55:53] <coldhead> i don't know anything about socket
[16:55:58] <coldhead> it might not be "secret"
[16:56:02] <raj> k
[16:56:13] <coldhead> soz
[16:56:32] <tds5016> coldhead: I shouldn't use "on"
[16:56:46] <coldhead> you can use on if you prefer!
[16:56:55] <coldhead> hover() just calls on() internally
[16:57:06] <coldhead> hover is slightly more readable, to my eyes
[16:57:20] <coldhead> on you have to bind to mouseover and nouseout
[16:59:48] <tueson> or delegated events like $container.on('hover', '.innerDivClass', function() {
[17:00:21] <tds5016> coldhead: how would I get the hover stopped?
[17:00:36] <coldhead> ?hoveer
[17:00:38] <bot-t> coldhead, .hover() | jQuery API Documentation - Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[17:00:45] <coldhead> wow good work bot-t
[17:00:52] <coldhead> tds5016: you can provide TWO functions
[17:00:55] <coldhead> one for in, one for out
[17:01:01] <coldhead> i was being lazy and using the same for both
[17:01:12] <coldhead> and to remove it, use unbind or off
[17:01:28] <tds5016> oh, nice!
[17:01:28] <raj> coldhead, are there signed cookies in $.cookie?
[17:01:41] <raj> or any way to do it securely?
[17:02:06] <coldhead> youd have to ask google
[17:02:14] <coldhead> i don't generally think of cookies as a secure mechanism
[17:02:37] <coldhead> there are probably simple encryption techniques
[17:08:07] <pinholecamera> thanks y'all!
[17:19:44] <[N]asser`> Hey guys I had a question. Kind of new to using jquery, but I noticed that the change event used on a select only gets fired if the actual value of the options are different (and not if the index is changed, regardless of the value)
[17:19:56] <[N]asser`> Is there an event I can use that would fire on index change, and not value change?
[17:21:09] <DyeA> I have an simple question - whats the order of JavaScript execution in page between 1) script loading a file in head, 2) script loading a file in body,  and 3) script with JavaScript directly in the tag in the body? I have a situation, only in IE7, where a script in the body of the page, fires my init (not in a .ready() handler), and the lib that is linked in the head is not available...
[17:22:40] <Fenikkusu> DyeA, is there any reason as to why it's not in $(function(){})? Generally speaking due to lag among other reasons, there is no sure way of predicting the orders.
[17:22:56] <coldhead> DyeA: i believe they're all loaded and evaluated in the order they appear in the HTML
[17:23:42] <DyeA> Fenikkusu: I wrote it so long ago i don't remember why it is not in a handler, i believe there was a JavaScript FUOC and it was smoother not in the handler
[17:24:02] <DyeA> this project has been going on 9 months now :/
[17:24:39] <DyeA> coldhead: so the only reason to append scripts in the body is for perf reasons not for functionality reasons
[17:25:18] <Fenikkusu> DyeA, that said, I would update it so that it is within the handler, and then use CSS to hide it with a simple 'loading' logo or something and remove the css/loader within the init.
[17:25:19] <DyeA> coldhead: but some libs need the script in the head, why is that again?
[17:25:36] <coldhead> i think only modernizr needs to go in the head
[17:25:39] <DyeA> Fenikkusu: yeah thats simple and smart
[17:25:45] <coldhead> because it does magic with stuff as it loads
[17:25:55] <DyeA> typekit needs to be in the head
[17:25:57] <DyeA> for fouc
[17:25:59] <coldhead> so called "best practice" is to dump everything at the bottom
[17:26:15] <coldhead> oh yeah, that kind of thing too
[17:26:16] <Eviltwin> There are many cases where order matters but typically not height in the document for scripts
[17:26:20] <DyeA> and that shite library addThis wants to be in the head
[17:26:26] <DyeA> and it needs jquery i believe
[17:26:43] <DyeA> Eviltwin: height?
[17:26:50] <coldhead> addThis gets the job done
[17:26:51] <Fenikkusu> ...I don't remember addThis needing jQuery...
[17:26:54] <coldhead> s/height/offset/
[17:27:16] <DyeA> coldhead: yeah but they insert a div and iframe into the head of your document !
[17:27:21] <Eviltwin> Byte location
[17:27:31] <[N]asser`> anyone have any ideas bout my issue?
[17:28:52] <DyeA> actually i think it was selectivzr that wanted to be in the head to do its thing
[17:29:26] <raj> I can't find the answer on google... can $.cookie create signed cookies?
[17:29:59] <Fenikkusu> Can someone verify this real quick: Doing var myClass = {myProp : true}; myClass.constructor = function(el) {this.el = el;} is the same as doing var myClass = function(el) {this.myProp = true;this.el = el};
[17:30:10] <DyeA> alirght well thanks all, i am tired and slow at the moment and probably not the quickest. i am going to move it to a doc ready and see if there are visual issues and if so address like Fenikkusu said
[17:31:10] <coldhead> it can't, raj, i meant you could apply some kind of encryption to the content of the cookie, but $.cookie wouldn't know or care about it
[17:34:36] <[N]asser`> hm
[17:34:50] <onceler> How do I select an element (just one) without id or class name and has many siblings?
[17:35:07] <systemfault> o_O
[17:35:11] <DyeA> Fenikkusu: I see differences the first throws an error etc
[17:35:12] <DyeA> http://fiddle.jshell.net/vh87P/
[17:35:57] <DyeA> onceler: you know the order in which it occurs?
[17:36:10] <raj> coldhead, so it can be encrypted, but not signed?
[17:36:14] <raj> cuz those are different?
[17:36:37] <raj> signed means being sure I put it there
[17:36:45] <raj> encryption just crypts it
[17:36:55] <Fenikkusu> DyeA, Interesting...back to the drawing board then. Ty
[17:37:24] <DyeA> sure
[17:37:38] <onceler> DyeA, yes, second
[17:37:47] <DyeA> Fenikkusu: ty for your help
[17:37:52] <dwboutin> Hi everyone
[17:38:00] <coldhead> raj: encryption can be used as a form of signing
[17:38:11] <dwboutin> Can i have some advices from some javascript masters
[17:38:13] <Fenikkusu> DyeA, Likewise
[17:38:19] <DyeA> onceler: and you know its tag type? $('body p').eq(2)
[17:38:19] <dwboutin> please -_-
[17:38:22] <raj> coldhead, reliable?
[17:38:47] <coldhead> probably not, raj
[17:38:57] <raj> then how does "signing" work?
[17:39:09] <raj> if it's not encrypted
[17:39:32] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/523629/tips-on-signed-cookies-instead-of-sessions
[17:39:39] <Caelum> can you do <script src="..." type="text/javascript" /> or do you have to do </script> to close it?
[17:39:49] <coldhead> you can produce a hash of the content with a secret key
[17:40:01] <coldhead> it's non-trivial, raj
[17:40:12] <Eviltwin> Also, hang on
[17:40:19] <Eviltwin> Why are you trying to sign the cookies from JavaScript?
[17:40:20] <coldhead> i still just think of cookies as unsecure and get on with things
[17:40:38] <raj> coldhead, so secret key + hash = encryption, no?
[17:40:42] <Caelum> my framework signs all cookies with a secret key
[17:41:09] <Eviltwin> raj: Slow down a sec
[17:41:20] <Eviltwin> Why are you trying to sign a cookie in JavaScript?
[17:41:33] <coldhead> raj: just do whatever Eviltwin says, he's a very smart um.... cookie
[17:41:45] <raj> I'm using sockjs
[17:41:57] <raj> and my server only saves cookies on page refresh
[17:42:36] <raj> so when the person goes to the page, and I have a new sockjs connection, I want to add the sockjs session id (for that browser tab) to the $.cookie
[17:43:00] <raj> so i can retrieve it from serverside to see which browser tab sent any request
[17:43:13] <Caelum> so anyone know if you can do <script /> or do you have to do <script></script> ?
[17:43:31] <tw2113> i believe the latter
[17:43:58] <Caelum> ok, in that case how do I put the string "</script>" in my javascript code which is itself inside a <script> tag?
[17:44:24] <Eviltwin> Caelum: Use // <!-- at the top of your script block
[17:44:27] <Eviltwin> Caelum: And use // --> at the bottom
[17:44:41] <Caelum> Eviltwin: aha, thanks!
[17:44:42] <Eviltwin> raj: So why are you trying to sign it?
[17:44:44] <dwboutin> !!! = Im a noob in big javascript apps, but i want to learn to correct way, do someone can give me good advices to learn well and code right? I'm reading "Javascript the good parts right now" and i bought "Javascript Patterns" Do i have to know some thing else to begin creating some good js apps with awesome code ? Thank you very much
[17:44:46] <b-ot> dwboutin, sorry, no results for ‟site:developer.mozilla.org reading "Javascript the good parts right now" and i bought "Javascript Patterns" Do i have to know some thing else to begin creating some good js apps with awesome code ? Thank you very much”.
[17:44:51] <Eviltwin> Why not just have the value in the cookie
[17:44:55] <raj> Eviltwin, so users can't be impersonated
[17:45:24] <Eviltwin> So your client side JavaScript is performing the signing?
[17:45:24] <dwboutin> Im a noob in big javascript apps, but i want to learn to correct way, do someone can give me good advices to learn well and code right? I'm reading "Javascript the good parts right now" and i bought "Javascript Patterns" Do i have to know some thing else to begin creating some good js apps with awesome code ? Thank you very much
[17:45:47] <raj> Eviltwin, clientside is $.cookie
[17:45:51] <raj> not sure it can sign anything
[17:46:18] <ItsJustMe> is it possible to store some css rules at runtime in something like a cache? i would like to modify the elRTE-wysiwyg-editor to edit real files ..
[17:46:22] <raj> all I have is serverside, I can do stuff during on_open or on_message for when sockjs's socket connection is made
[17:46:22] <coldhead> dwboutin: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018421.do
[17:46:31] <ItsJustMe> but how can i load the css files of a specific file?
[17:46:34] <Eviltwin> So here's the problem
[17:46:34] <ItsJustMe> at runtime
[17:46:48] <Eviltwin> If you put signing code or whatever in your client JavaScript
[17:46:56] <Eviltwin> So that your JavaScript can sign the ID
[17:47:02] <Eviltwin> Anyone can just poke at the source, dig that out
[17:47:06] <Eviltwin> And sign whatever ID they want
[17:47:06] <raj> right
[17:47:08] <Eviltwin> And send it to your server
[17:47:14] <dwboutin> coldhead : With this ill be ok to code well ?
[17:47:18] <Eviltwin> It literally accomplishes no additional security
[17:47:27] <coldhead> yes dwboutin, it's by a Noted Expert
[17:47:58] <raj> so I need my server to do what when a new sockjs socket is opened?
[17:48:16] <raj> how can I find out in the future, where a request came from?
[17:48:21] <Eviltwin> Your server should be in charge of assigning session IDs
[17:48:37] <raj> it does
[17:48:41] <raj> but it only does so on page refresh
[17:48:56] <Eviltwin> The simplest way is to just randomly assign the session number and store it in a database with the user name and expiration stuff
[17:49:06] <foo> gnarf: $("input[name='namehere'][type='text']") ?
[17:49:10] <raj> I can do request.session ... stuff, but only on an http request
[17:49:13] <Eviltwin> Then the server sends that down to the cient when they authenticate (probably as a cookie)
[17:49:17] <foo> gnarf: so, I have that. How can I check if that's empty?
[17:49:32] <raj> Eviltwin, that's what I'm currently doing
[17:49:40] <Eviltwin> So what's the problem you're facing now?
[17:49:47] <raj> wait a second
[17:49:50] <raj> you just made me realize something
[17:49:51] <raj> one sec
[17:49:53] <dwboutin> coldhead: i must read Javascript Patterns before i guess
[17:49:57] <dwboutin> it will help
[17:49:59] <Fenikkusu> DyeA, Figured out the difference of the two formats. The first format you don't call with new myClass but rather with Object.create(myClass);
[17:50:21] <coldhead> dwboutin: it depends how urgently you need to start building apps
[17:50:22] <foo> How can I select an element with the name attribute only and check to see if it's blank? Someone said this earlier, but I can't seem to connect the dots:  $("input[name='namehere'][type='text']")  - any tips? thanks
[17:51:08] <Eviltwin> $('input[name=""]') is all <input name="" /> elements
[17:51:22] <Eviltwin> $('input:not([name])') is all <input /> elements without a "name" attribute
[17:51:23] <foo> Eviltwin: aha, thanks, and how can I check if that's empty?
[17:51:47] <dwboutin> coldhead: it's not urgent, but i'm hurry to have some fun!
[17:51:48] <Eviltwin> foo: see ?.val
[17:51:49] * foo loves jquery, so much to leanr
[17:51:53] <foo> Eviltwin: thanks
[17:51:57] * foo waits for bot factor
[17:51:59] <foo> factoid
[17:52:03] <Eviltwin> Okay, here instead: http://api.jquery.com/val/
[17:52:04] <coldhead> good luck dwboutin!
[17:52:13] <dwboutin> Thank you
[17:52:16] <dwboutin> just bought it
[17:52:17] <dwboutin> Alex MacCaw
[17:52:22] <dwboutin> i saw his blog
[17:52:28] <dwboutin> he is rly gr8
[17:52:42] <coldhead> yes, he has much to teach us
[17:53:03] <dwboutin> i want to be at this level one day
[17:53:15] <raj> Eviltwin, wait, ok, the issue is, requests from http are not in the same "view" functions (MVC server architecture) as requests from sockjs
[17:53:38] <raj> so if I want to send a message to a sockjs user, I can only look up all the sessions according to their username
[17:54:04] <Eviltwin> Well that sounds like a design flaw
[17:54:12] <raj> the username being a signed cookie from the auth policy of my server
[17:54:53] <raj> so basically, to counteract this
[17:55:07] <raj> I want to also have the sockjs id available to me from a cookie
[17:55:16] <raj> because that'll be able to differentiate btwn different tabs, afaik
[17:55:46] <raj> and then with the sockjs id, I can actually .send() a message to an exact session
[17:56:15] <coldhead> you are doing hardcore stuff, raj
[17:56:17] <coldhead> i fear it
[17:56:34] <raj> i need a safe word
[17:57:27] <coldhead> hahah
[18:03:37] <ItsJustMe> solved my question
[18:03:41] <ItsJustMe> thx, bb+
[18:04:36] <coldhead> great work everyone
[18:05:37] <raj> lol
[18:05:58] <Eviltwin> raj: If I understand what you have correctly
[18:06:05] <Eviltwin> You should be able to do a flow like this: http://cl.ly/3F0b2r353Z0J
[18:06:20] <Eviltwin> The top part is them logging in for the first time
[18:06:25] <Eviltwin> (However that works)
[18:06:29] <Eviltwin> And getting a session ID
[18:06:42] <Eviltwin> Then connecting via sockjs to the server
[18:06:57] <Eviltwin> And at some point making a request or whatever via sockjs
[18:07:53] <Eviltwin> sockjs ID -> session ID -> (user, session expiration info, etc)
[18:08:30] <Eviltwin> Hopefully that makes sense and solves whatever problem you had
[18:09:13] <coldhead> thanks Eviltwin!
[18:09:25] <Primer> I'm curious about why I can't disable the first tab of a ui.tabs
[18:09:36] <Primer> http://jsfiddle.net/WqPtr/
[18:09:38] <Eviltwin> Primer: Is it selected at the time?
[18:09:53] <Primer> Eviltwin: I'm also setting active
[18:10:04] <Eviltwin> Primer: http://jsfiddle.net/vrMKm/
[18:10:35] <Primer> I guess it's selected, not active
[18:10:47] <Primer> that works, thanks
[18:10:54] <Eviltwin> Well you're also not setting active as far as I can see :P
[18:11:16] <Primer> I fail to see the difference between active and selected. /me goes back to reading the docs
[18:11:32] <Primer> That fiddle wasn't mine, btw, just something I found on stackoverflow
[18:12:15] <coldhead> no one is blaming you, Primer
[18:12:55] <Primer> I'm just glad to have found the answer quickly :)
[18:12:58] <Primer> thanks again
[18:13:00] <Caelum> am I doing this correctly: http://pastie.org/5840350
[18:13:18] <Eviltwin> Nope
[18:14:24] <raj> Eviltwin, the "verify session id" for sockjs...I don't think that happens, does it?
[18:14:44] <Eviltwin> I'm saying you want to do that when a connection happens
[18:14:50] <raj> oh, it does
[18:14:58] <Caelum> Eviltwin: what did I do wrong there?
[18:14:58] <raj> it's the authenticated_userid, ok
[18:15:02] <raj> from the server
[18:15:10] <raj> yes, then they associate, cool
[18:15:30] <Eviltwin> Okay, as long as the server is determining the user based on the session ID or whatever
[18:15:48] <Eviltwin> If the client is sending along the username at that point (without the password) then someone could exploit it
[18:15:48] <raj> ok, the "client (in some tab) send data to the server" stuff is fine
[18:15:59] <raj> ...i mean it's fine when it's sockjs
[18:16:04] <raj> i can tell which browser tab did it
[18:16:15] <raj> ...problem arises when they send a regular request to the server
[18:16:22] <Eviltwin> Like AJAX?
[18:16:27] <raj> through another POST for example
[18:16:28] <raj> or yes, ajax
[18:16:59] <Eviltwin> And you want to identify which tab did that?
[18:17:01] <raj> then it goes to the server's own "view" instead of the sockjs "view"
[18:17:05] <raj> exactly!
[18:17:20] <raj> I can see which user sent it, and all his session, but I can't identify which session
[18:17:42] <Eviltwin> Can the client-side sockjs report its sockjs ID?
[18:18:55] <raj> not sure
[18:19:07] <raj> well, it can within the sockjs "view"
[18:19:24] <raj> but it's not on the usual http request
[18:19:53] <Eviltwin> What I'm wondering is if the first time you connect via sockjs
[18:19:54] <onceler> I'm iterating through input type text elements, each in its own td, with only name as attributes. The number of these elements is unknown. How can I select a sibling (also in its own td of same tr as the one being iterated) of the element being iterated? http://jsfiddle.net/Y6bhB/8/ lol, I know that sounds tricky :)
[18:20:03] <Eviltwin> You can get that sockjs session ID on the client
[18:20:09] <Eviltwin> And tuck that as a hidden attribute in the forms
[18:20:45] <raj> well, in fact, I have to "authenticate" every user on the website
[18:20:49] <raj> regardless of whether they "logged in"
[18:21:17] <raj> just so I can identify the same user across multiple tabs!
[18:21:39] <raj> so they are, what I call "temp_authenticated"
[18:21:57] <raj> their username begins with 'GuestXXXX'
[18:22:30] <Caelum> onceler: $(this).parent().find('[name=bravo]') ?
[18:23:16] <onceler> Caelum, thanks dude, will that try out :)
[18:23:57] <Caelum> when you document.write('<script...>') that gets evaluated at the bottom of the page right?
[18:27:56] <Eviltwin> raj: Here's what I'm proposing: http://cl.ly/1g013U0l0I2q
[18:29:33] <raj> Eviltwin, tab ID being a sockjs ID?
[18:29:43] <raj> cuz sockjs has a separate ID for each tab
[18:30:12] <raj> or you mean create my own tab ID and associate it with the sockjs ID serverside?
[18:31:02] <Eviltwin> raj: Well after a POST, the new sockjs ID is probably going to be different
[18:31:07] <Eviltwin> While it's still in the same tab
[18:31:37] <Eviltwin> Which is where this separate ID comes into play
[18:31:41] <mintee> uber noob question.  I'm using jqwidgets to display a gauge, and I need to pull a variable from python for the gauge.  How can I keep this going and refreshing every 2-5 seconds?
[18:31:41] <raj> sockjs ID stays the same for a session
[18:31:41] <Eviltwin> One that the client controls
[18:32:14] <Eviltwin> So if I click a link on the page or submit a form and the browser navigates
[18:32:24] <Eviltwin> The sockjs session in that tab will be the same before and after that navigation?
[18:32:40] <mintee> I'm using a raspberrypi and thermocouple to tell the temp, and I want it to be updated on a page.
[18:33:03] <Eviltwin> mintee: Do you currently have a page of any kind that reads the temp?
[18:33:09] <raj> Eviltwin, you're referring to page refreshes, right?
[18:33:13] <Eviltwin> Yes
[18:33:15] <raj> not ajax POSTs
[18:33:23] <Eviltwin> Yes, classic POSTs
[18:33:24] <raj> all pages are loaded dynamically now
[18:33:34] <Eviltwin> Okay
[18:33:35] <Eviltwin> Then refreshes
[18:33:44] <raj> so there are essentially no refreshes
[18:33:48] <mintee> Eviltwin, yes, using ajax
[18:33:51] <Eviltwin> So why are we talking?
[18:33:54] <raj> which is where the issue comes in with saving the cookie
[18:34:10] <raj> because if there's an ajax post, I can't see where the ajax post came from
[18:34:19] <raj> like, besides that it's a particular user
[18:34:22] <raj> i can't see which tab
[18:34:30] <Eviltwin> Okay so that's where I was saying you want to get the sockjs ID from the client
[18:34:39] <Eviltwin> And attach that to every AJAX request
[18:34:41] <Caelum> mintee: make an ajax api
[18:34:45] <raj> ok
[18:34:47] <Caelum> mintee: that returns json
[18:35:26] <raj> Eviltwin, two things 1) is that safe? 2) can I make that automatic with every POST/GET/whatever going to the server?
[18:35:59] <Eviltwin> 1) Yes as long as there's no good way for a user to guess someone else's sockjs ID
[18:36:13] <Eviltwin> It might help if the server randomly assigns a long ID
[18:36:13] <raj> there isn't
[18:36:22] <mintee> the current ajax that i'm using is really dirty and flashs the page each time it reloads
[18:36:28] <raj> it's random alphanumeric 6 characters
[18:36:53] <mintee> Caelum, guess you missed the part about uber noob.  :/  no clue how to make an ajax api
[18:37:03] <Eviltwin> 2) Look at the global AJAX events: http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events
[18:37:30] <Caelum> mintee: what framework are you using in python
[18:37:42] <raj> Eviltwin, if someone gets a user's sockjs ID, what about XSS forgery attacks?
[18:37:43] <mintee> I'm using python server pages
[18:37:47] <mintee> and no framework
[18:37:55] <mintee> just hacking at some premade code
[18:38:30] <Eviltwin> If someone gets a user's sockjs ID, then for all intents and purposes they're that user
[18:38:38] <Eviltwin> Just as if they had gotten that user's username and password
[18:39:02] <Eviltwin> You can have the server check that the IP address stays the same for any given sockjs ID as a start
[18:39:17] <Eviltwin> But if they change wifi networks or something they might have to log back in
[18:39:59] <Caelum> mintee: look at .ajax with dataType: 'json', make a page that writes out some json. Use .delay to set up the loop
[18:40:21] <mintee> ok, i'll give do some research.... thanks
[18:42:03] <raj> Eviltwin, that seems reasonable
[18:42:08] <raj> but can't someone just fake their IP address?
[18:42:21] <raj> or put it as whatever they want
[18:44:39] <Eviltwin> Not for TCP
[18:44:48] <Eviltwin> Which HTTP is based on top of
[18:45:05] <Eviltwin> As I said, it's a start
[18:45:11] <raj> k
[18:45:19] <Eviltwin> It's not fool-proof in the same way a password isn't fool-proof
[18:45:20] <raj> i'm really impressed that you understood what I was talking about
[18:45:35] <raj> like, actually shocked
[18:45:36] <Eviltwin> If someone guesses or intercepts that password or watches them type in the password
[18:45:56] <Eviltwin> Then there's no way to tell the difference between that person with the stolen password and the real person
[18:46:06] <raj> what password?
[18:46:37] <Eviltwin> All I'm trying to say is if an attacker managed to steal a user's session ID
[18:46:50] <Eviltwin> They could have just as easily stolen the password or other credentials they used to sign in in the first place
[18:47:50] <Eviltwin> I gotta run
[18:47:52] <Eviltwin> Best of luck
[18:48:03] <raj> thank you Eviltwin
[18:48:05] <raj> :)
[18:48:26] <raj> , btw, yes, that makes sense
[18:48:56] <raj> hmm, then why is XSS a big deal?
[18:51:16] <CoJaBo> raj: ..because it can do anything the user can
[18:51:45] <Eviltwin> XSS is a defect in server code
[18:52:05] <Eviltwin> (Turns out I have a few more minutes)
[18:52:06] <CoJaBo> most XSS attacks I've seen (stored XSS) just insert malware or porn ads
[18:52:14] <CoJaBo> hackers aren't creative anymore
[18:52:17] <Eviltwin> For example let's say I have a blog with comments
[18:52:36] <Eviltwin> And you can type whatever you want in the comments and anyone else who goes to my blog sees your comments
[18:52:47] <Eviltwin> And to allow for some style
[18:52:51] <Eviltwin> I let you put in arbitrary HTML
[18:53:00] <Eviltwin> So you can so "I was <i>SOOO</i> busy"
[18:53:08] <Eviltwin> And that gets rendered in the page
[18:53:08] <raj> gotcha
[18:53:12] <Eviltwin> Now instead
[18:53:29] <Eviltwin> I comment <script type="text/javascript">window.location="http://my.web.site/";</script>
[18:53:37] <Eviltwin> Your server puts that in the page
[18:53:50] <Eviltwin> And now *everyone* who goes to that page gets bounced to mine instead
[18:53:55] <papanatas> Guys, I've got this  $.post('http://www.example.com/create/map/map.php', {  but it keeps telling me its not allowed
[18:53:57] <papanatas> someone know how can I get around this without going jsonp or someting?
[18:53:59] <Eviltwin> Or worse
[18:54:29] <Eviltwin> I have it make other AJAX requests on that user's behalf
[18:54:38] <Eviltwin> While they're on your site
[18:55:15] <raj> so this is prevented by stripping html
[18:55:16] <Eviltwin> Now people frequently confuse XSS with CSRF
[18:55:22] <raj> I think that's what I meant
[18:55:23] <Eviltwin> Which stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery
[18:55:28] <raj> yes, that's what I meant
[18:55:45] <Eviltwin> That's where I have a backend for my website
[18:55:57] <Eviltwin> An API for my website*
[18:56:19] <Eviltwin> Where I can do something like /transfer?dollars=5000&to=John+Smith
[18:56:27] <Eviltwin> And it'll cause a bank transaction to happen from my account to John Smith
[18:56:47] <Eviltwin> I use a session cookie to ensure that only logged in users can do it though
[18:57:06] <Eviltwin> The problem is that I go to a forum where people can embed images with arbitrary URLs
[18:57:23] <Eviltwin> And someone has embedded <img src="http://mysite.com/transfer?dollars=5000&to=John+Smith">
[18:57:31] <Eviltwin> Which doesn't load an image but it does cause the GET request to happen
[18:57:43] <tw2113> ajpiano, i find it intriguing that the admin is rarely if ever touched for the new jquery.com network
[18:57:54] <Eviltwin> And when it opens in my browser, it has my session cookie in the request
[18:58:14] <Eviltwin> So as far as the site can tell, I made a request to transfer 5000 to John Smith
[18:58:51] <raj> I see
[18:59:33] <Eviltwin> There are a couple ways to prevent that
[18:59:47] <Eviltwin> 1) Check that the Referrer header is from your website and not someone else's
[19:00:04] <Eviltwin> 2) Using POST means they can't use the <img> or <script> trick
[19:00:11] <Eviltwin> But a malicious form on another page could still target you
[19:00:27] <raj> 2) sounds like it's for XSS
[19:00:48] <Eviltwin> 3) Require that the session key also be sent as a GET or POST parameter
[19:01:03] <Eviltwin> Since malicious JavaScript on another site won't be able to read cookies for your site
[19:01:35] <raj> a session key which is provided during each page refresh? and expected back on the server?
[19:01:51] <Eviltwin> It can be the same key that's in the cookie
[19:02:00] <Eviltwin> JavaScript on your site can read those cookies
[19:02:11] <Eviltwin> Malicious JavaScript on other sites can't
[19:02:21] <Eviltwin> So they won't be able to include that in the request
[19:02:29] <Eviltwin> You can read more about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRF
[19:02:34] <Eviltwin> I actually have to go now
[19:02:44] <raj> but can't the CSRF website just it from the session cookie in the browser the same way?
[19:02:56] <raj> *just get it
[19:02:56] <Eviltwin> Because Cookies have an origin policy
[19:03:24] <raj> but you said before that they were able to submit the POST using the browser's Cookie for my website
[19:03:41] <Eviltwin> Ah, the browser will send the cookies from your site
[19:03:54] <Eviltwin> But JavaScript from the other page won't be able to read them
[19:04:17] <Eviltwin> So there will be a Cookie header but the JavaScript won't be able to send the same value as a GET or POST parameter
[19:04:22] <raj> but the issue is sending a POST request for a bank transfer
[19:04:28] <papanatas> anyone knows how can I convert this request
[19:04:36] <papanatas> $.post('http://www.example.com/create/map/map.php', {
[19:04:41] <papanatas> into jsonp?
[19:05:20] <Eviltwin> raj: I'd love to explain further but I have to go, sorry.
[19:05:22] <Eviltwin> Perhaps later
[19:05:53] <raj> ok, no prob, thank you Eviltwin!
[19:18:14] <nesoi> hey could someone look at this for me? I'm just starting to look at jquery and I tried to make one of the very simple samples, and it won't render: http://pastie.org/private/dkt4dt0nkwieac3gbasxdw#11-12
[19:18:27] <nesoi> I have all the js and css files in the same directory as the index.html file
[19:18:58] <nesoi> probably some obvious error I'm missing
[19:19:55] <papanatas> someone knows why this gives me an error tokeN? http://pastebin.com/FCzCkHhe
[19:31:55] <onceler> Caelum, It didn't work my friend: http://jsfiddle.net/Y6bhB/11/
[19:32:17] <mfoxdogg|work> afternoon all
[19:34:57] <Caelum> onceler: http://jsfiddle.net/Y6bhB/13/
[19:35:11] <Caelum> onceler: the first parent is the td, the second parent is the tr
[19:35:47] <Caelum> onceler: also don't use .value on wrapped elements, use .val()
[19:37:30] <onceler> Caelum, you're awesome man! Thank you :)
[19:38:04] <mintee> ok, i'm having some bad luck tonight
[19:38:13] <mintee> why does this => http://mintee.servebeer.com/code.png
[19:38:21] <mintee> give me this => http://mintee.servebeer.com/result.png
[19:41:28] <systemfault> Because you touch yourself at night.
[19:41:40] <systemfault> Why don't you check what .load does?
[19:41:47] <mintee> and in the morning!
[19:42:22] <systemfault> .load exists to load html.
[19:42:32] <systemfault> You're trying to load an image with it :/
[19:42:51] <mintee> yes, i know that
[19:43:17] <mintee> and i realize it's giving me the binary of the actual image
[19:43:17] <systemfault> Then everyone's happy!
[19:43:35] <systemfault> Right.. it reads the binary as text
[19:43:35] <papanatas> GUYS! Help! http://pastebin.com/rsi0Mt0t Why this ajax isn't making any POST?
[19:43:42] <jrockjiggz> you probably want to $('div').html( $('<img />').prop('img.png') );
[19:46:08] <mintee> :'(
[19:46:30] <papanatas> any ideas?
[19:46:31] <papanatas> http://pastebin.com/rsi0Mt0t
[19:52:03] <digitalmediaguy> Anyone used the scrollTo or localScroll plugins?
[19:52:42] <digitalmediaguy> I cannot get easing to work… atleast with localScroll & the jQuery easing pluigin… Has anyone done that?
[19:52:47] <hariom> Hello friends, I am seeing aborted result in IE9 developer tool and site is not loading properly. It works fine sometime though in FF
[19:54:32] <inspiron> hello, does anyone know of an easy way to retrieve an "svg" on a server from the client side? i'm using XMLHttpRequest and ran into a problem with cross-domain blocking
[19:54:47] <inspiron> I'm looking for something else besides XMLHttpRequest
[20:00:39] <nesoi> so what obvious thing am I completely overlooking here? $( document ).ready(function() {
[20:00:41] <nesoi> oops
[20:00:48] <nesoi> so what obvious thing am I completely overlooking here? http://pastie.org/private/dkt4dt0nkwieac3gbasxdw#12
[20:02:30] <systemfault> nesoi: It's only html on that page.
[20:02:57] <nesoi> systemfault:  so what do I have to do to get it to render?
[20:03:59] <systemfault> Render?
[20:04:06] <nesoi> ?
[20:04:32] <systemfault> It's a plain html page.
[20:04:42] <systemfault> Not sure what kind of magic you're expecting.
[20:04:49] <nesoi> I have no clue, obviously!
[20:05:30] <nesoi> I was copying some examples and they look like this and render properly
[20:05:37] <nesoi> so what do I have to do to make it work?
[20:09:03] <nesoi> systemfault: ?
[20:11:59] <nesoi> is it not rendering because I'm viewing it on a desktop rather than a mobile browser?
[20:12:10] <nesoi> do I need to change the ident string?
[20:14:38] <nesoi> all the examples I'm finding look just like this, so what am I doing wrong? anyone take a look?
[20:16:50] <Caelum> conditionally loading jquery doesn't work in ie8 :(
[20:18:03] <nesoi> seriously, can someone please look at this and tell me why it wouldn't work. I can't find it: http://pastie.org/private/dkt4dt0nkwieac3gbasxdw#12
[20:18:17] <nesoi> the css is not rendering
[20:18:25] <nesoi> seems really obvious but I can't find it

[20:19:45] <nesoi> all the files are in the same directory
[20:20:14] <nesoi> so I have to have my useragent set to a mobile browser or something?

[20:26:38] <systemfault> It has been deprecated since the day of your birth...
[20:26:47] <systemfault> it was about fucking time they removed it.

[20:32:14] <nesoi> can anyone suggest anything? I feel like an idiot that I can't even get the most simple example to render with jquery mobile css
[20:32:24] <nesoi> why would it give me like 1000 errors?

[20:42:40] <xxx_> @caelum: tyy..will check it!
[20:42:48] <dismist> thats bullshit... they broke a plugin as nice as sparkline
[20:42:58] <dismist> because they felt like removing .browser
[20:43:06] <systemfault> Because it was crap.
[20:43:12] <dismist> .live was a better description than .on
[20:43:19] <dismist> .on sounds like a cursor gesture or some shit
[20:43:34] <systemfault> What?
[20:44:09] <systemfault> something.on('click', …)  reads like "on click, do X"
[20:44:15] <systemfault> .live didn't mean shit.
[20:44:21] <dismist> its principle
[20:44:25] <dismist> u dont change the foundations
[20:44:33] <dismist> why do you think referrer is still spelled wrong
[20:44:47] <systemfault> HTTP is not jquery.
[20:45:01] <Caelum> xxx_: does that make sense?
[20:45:28] <MattBrotz> could I get some help
[20:45:38] <systemfault> dismist: I know it must fucking suck with a capital F to have to repair your website :/
[20:45:56] <Caelum> yeah, that's what I'm doing now
[20:45:57] <systemfault> But sometimes, it's good to break things for the future.
[20:46:01] <dismist> u aint kiddin
[20:46:21] <Fenikkusu> Blast now it's saying the function isn't defined.
[20:46:23] <dismist> doesnt even look like sparkline has updated
[20:46:39] <systemfault> dismist: have you looked at jquery migrate^
[20:46:40] <systemfault> ?
[20:46:45] <dismist> no
[20:47:10] <systemfault> dismist: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/

[20:48:25] <dismist> thanks man 2 lines of code.  that will kick too much ass if it works
[20:48:35] <xxx_> @caelum: lukz ur code will help me out! will test in my localhost and let u know.
[20:48:42] <systemfault> dismist: I hope for you
[20:48:59] <systemfault> dismist: Don't include jquery 1.8.3 like in the doc :P
[20:49:13] <systemfault> dismist: just jquery.migrate after you include 1.9

[20:50:01] <MattBrotz> I want this app to allow people to click on a box, put that box(es) in the input box, then hit clear and put them back down to where they came from
[20:50:08] <MattBrotz> http://jsfiddle.net/NEUKE/1/
[20:50:17] <systemfault> dismist: Not sure you included jquery 1.9 two times
[20:50:30] <MattBrotz> then allow them to click on them again (not working)
[20:50:57] <dismist> damn sorry man high moment
[20:51:01] <dismist> thanks for the tip sys
[20:52:13] <dismist> interesting... it let the javascript to continue to render through page load when i added that library
[20:52:17] <MattBrotz> please help thanks.
[20:52:21] <dismist> then when i tried to use sparkline i got that same damn error
[20:53:56] <xxx_> @caelum: dint work :(
[20:54:02] <dismist> guess i can just use an old ass google cdn... what version did you say got rid of $.browser and .live
[20:55:06] <MattBrotz> http://jsfiddle.net/NEUKE/1/ , please thanks
[20:59:02] <systemfault> dismist: 1.9.. so if you use any of the 1.8 series, it will work
[20:59:10] <xxx_> @caelum: hey it worked!
[21:00:39] <xxx_> @caelum: but nw tht content  sud be displayed  in a box like thing
[21:01:17] <Caelum> xxx_: that's all css
[21:01:25] <Caelum> xxx_: there's a #css
[21:01:45] <Caelum> well I figured out my IE8 conditional loading problem, this works: http://gist.github.com/4617794
[21:02:02] <xxx_> @caelum: tyy soo much for the help!:)
[21:02:56] <Caelum> xxx_: no problem
[21:03:21] <Caelum> I suppose I might as well write a load_jquery function
[21:06:42] <MattBrotz> could someone help, sorry I asked so much.
[21:07:49] <Caelum> MattBrotz: what is your question
[21:08:06] <Caelum> MattBrotz: oh sorry it's in scrollback
[21:08:14] <MattBrotz> its ok
[21:09:04] <Caelum> MattBrotz: so what's not working
[21:09:56] <MattBrotz> 2 things, after 2 clears, it brings back more than what it should
[21:10:21] <MattBrotz> and after the clear, you can't click on them again, you should be able to
[21:11:33] <MattBrotz> I eventually want them to go in the last spot on the table, but I'm not worried about that right now
[21:12:49] <xxx_> anyone know php here
[21:13:49] <phishy> xxx_: haha yea, they do in ##php too :-)
[21:14:13] <xxx_> ##php
[21:14:37] <xxx_> how can i join  in ##php
[21:14:46] <phishy> type /join ##php
[21:14:57] <xxx_> ok thanq so much
[21:15:04] <Caelum> MattBrotz: I wouldn't do it that way
[21:15:15] <Caelum> MattBrotz: I'd just .hide() them
[21:15:26] <MattBrotz_> ok, I'll try that
[21:15:26] <Caelum> MattBrotz: and the way you did it, you don't know what row to put them in
[21:15:41] <MattBrotz_> well I'm not worried about that yet
[21:16:03] <Caelum> MattBrotz: also just: used = []; without the var, it comes from the outer scope
[21:16:31] <xxx_> <phishy> do know about php
[21:16:59] <coldhead> <3
[21:17:35] <MattBrotz_> Caelum: did I miss something you said, (before 23:15), what about being able to click on them again?
[21:18:40] <xxx_> i have some doubts in php
[21:20:00] <Caelum> MattBrotz_: use .on instead of .click
[21:20:04] <Caelum> MattBrotz_: then that will work
[21:20:29] <Caelum> xxx_: use the php channel :)
[21:21:01] <xxx_> ok but am trying to join but i can't
[21:21:06] <MattBrotz_> not .on, it doesn't work
[21:21:17] <xxx_> i just type  /join ##php
[21:21:26] <Caelum> MattBrotz_: but if you .hide() them instead of .remove() them, then you don't have to do that
[21:21:29] <MattBrotz_> xxx_ , you have to be identified I think
[21:21:47] <xxx_> ok
[21:21:50] <papanatas> http://pastebin.com/4QUvB8bD
[21:21:53] <papanatas> someone knows why this isn't working?
[21:22:00] <Caelum> MattBrotz_: .on definitely does work
[21:22:21] <MattBrotz_> http://jsfiddle.net/NEUKE/7/
[21:23:22] <coldhead> xxx_: /msg nickserv register and /msg nickserv help
[21:23:26] <Caelum> MattBrotz_: read the docs for .on, that's not how you use it
[21:23:33] <MattBrotz_> oh ok thanks
[21:24:32] <Caelum> MattBrotz_: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:30:41] <Caelum> ok, so I fixed this crap, I guess I can go home
[21:30:51] <Caelum> fucking IE8
[21:35:17] <monk3y> Caelum: I hear ya.
[21:45:21] <Jake617> Can anyone help me understand how I move an existing element using .after()
[21:45:22] <Jake617> ?
[21:45:30] <Jake617> I just can't do it lol
[21:47:32] <Caelum> Jake617: .after() inserts content after every element in the wrapped set, it does not move things
[21:47:37] <Caelum> Jake617: what do you want to do
[21:49:13] <Jake617> Here is what I have..
[21:49:25] <Jake617> $(document).ready(function(){
[21:49:33] <Caelum> use jsfiddle
[21:49:38] <Caelum> no need to paste to irc
[21:49:38] <Jake617> ok
[21:50:45] <Jake617> How do I link to my JS file in jsfiddle?
[21:50:52] <Jake617> =p
[21:50:55] <Caelum> external resources
[21:51:29] <Caelum> add resources rather
[21:53:40] <Jake617> http://jsfiddle.net/Rw7TH/
[21:53:53] <Jake617> Not sure why it's printing three 'Hey's
[21:53:55] <Jake617> but..
[21:54:09] <Jake617> I basically want to take the hey after the id #one and move it after #two
[21:55:39] <b1lly>  Jake617: you just want to add it to the end of the container?
[21:55:49] <mrlaw> anyone got dumps ?
[21:56:14] <Jake617> yeah, I'm a novice. Doing this in codecademy, but it's not explaining this part very well
[21:57:27] <b1lly> No clue what's wrong with your fiddle but
[21:57:35] <b1lly> it has 2 extra "heys" by default
[21:57:40] <mrlaw> anyone got dumps?
[21:57:44] <Jake617> It says target my exiting <p> and move it after the id #two
[21:58:09] <b1lly> what your doing is right
[21:58:13] <b1lly> its just bugged out
[21:58:28] <Jake617> I know why it's doing it
[21:58:35] <Jake617> I included two copies of my js
[21:58:40] <Jake617> one on my webserver and one in fiddle
[21:58:42] <Jake617> ignore it
[21:58:48] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/KRuVM/
[21:59:19] <Jake617> yup
[21:59:26] <Jake617> thats without my resource added, so there we go
[22:02:16] <Jake617> do we know how to move it?
[22:03:54] <b1lly> yes, we know, do you?
[22:04:48] <b1lly> look at append(), appendTo(), and same for prepend(), and prependTo()
[22:05:05] <b1lly> you most likely want appendTo, or prependTo
[22:05:42] <Jake617> No, it's asking me to use .after()
[22:05:48] <Jake617> won't let me move on less I do
[22:06:11] <Caelum> Jake617: http://jsfiddle.net/Rw7TH/2/
[22:06:20] <b1lly> $('p').after('element')
[22:06:23] <Caelum> Jake617: sorry this took me so long, it's late and I'm not thinking straight
[22:06:25] <papanatas> someone knows why jquery can't send $.post methods over http:// (CORS) even EVEN EVEN EVEN WHEN I HAVE SET THE DAMN .htaccess to allow * ????
[22:06:53] <b1lly> papanatas: your probably trying to send ajax cross domain
[22:07:03] <papanatas> that's right bigLanky
[22:07:12] <papanatas> that's right b1lly
[22:07:14] <b1lly> thats why :)
[22:07:17] <papanatas> I'm trying but I can't!
[22:07:25] <b1lly> its a security risk
[22:07:29] <b1lly> I dont think you can
[22:07:43] <greg5green> did you set 'crossDomain' to true?
[22:07:48] <coldhead> sup bigLanky
[22:07:50] <papanatas> I set up the allow * on htaccess and have everything working but for some reason, it doesn't sends the params
[22:08:01] <papanatas> yes sir, crossdomain is true
[22:08:26] <greg5green> do you get an error in your console?
[22:08:40] <b1lly> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/298745/how-do-i-send-a-cross-domain-post-request-via-javascript
[22:08:45] <b1lly> sup coldhead
[22:08:45] <papanatas> http://pastebin.com/v8dEczZL
[22:08:48] <papanatas> that's my code right there
[22:09:14] <Jake617> Okay, I tried $('p').after('#two') but that didn't work, so I tried that switched, and that just adds a
[22:09:18] <papanatas> yes, XMLHttpRequest cannot load (401 not authorized)
[22:09:26] <Jake617> p after Div#2 without removing the first Hey
[22:09:27] <Jake617> oi
[22:09:42] <papanatas> http://pastebin.com/v8dEczZL <<< take a look please
[22:10:15] <greg5green> papanatas, $.post doesn't support those extra properties
[22:10:19] <b1lly> Jake617: http://jsfiddle.net/KRuVM/1/ ?
[22:10:37] <greg5green> it only supports url, success, dataType, and data
[22:10:41] <Jake617> You are a God.
[22:10:48] <Jake617> *bows down*
[22:11:06] <papanatas> greg5green: seems to work when I don't have it on http:// but on a local address, thought what I want is HTTP
[22:11:41] <papanatas> actually it works quite well, I only need to get around the crossDomain issue
[22:12:31] <papanatas> any help? I'm on my 4th hour with this issue and I'm really dying here
[22:12:43] <greg5green> the way you wrote that, i think it's sending all those properties as your 'data'
[22:13:28] <greg5green> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[22:13:44] <papanatas> yes, but it doesn't sends it, it gives me a CORS error
[22:14:01] <greg5green> for CORS to work, you have to have two things to be true
[22:14:15] <papanatas> yes I know about that, if I use it json it works, if I use it jsonp it should work, but the data is not the issue, the issue is the CORS problem
[22:14:18] <greg5green> (if i remember correct)
[22:14:24] <Caelum> Jake617: did you see my fiddle?
[22:14:39] <greg5green> you have to have the header for the return set
[22:14:49] <greg5green> and you have to set crossDomain to true, which you are not doing there
[22:14:49] <papanatas> I actually used the example on that page
[22:14:53] <papanatas> like an hour ago
[22:14:55] <greg5green> you are sending data to your request
[22:14:56] <papanatas> and still, it gave me the same error
[22:15:00] <greg5green> that shows true
[22:15:29] <papanatas> crossDomain: true,<<< its in my code
[22:15:52] <papanatas> line 7
[22:15:55] <greg5green> yes, i see it
[22:16:12] <greg5green> you are sending that to your endpoint, not to the code that is executing the request
[22:16:28] <systemfault> jsonp is not CORS...
[22:16:53] <systemfault> jsonp is an ugly hack..and it only works with GET
[22:18:16] <papanatas> so it doesn't works with POST?
[22:18:30] <xxx_> does anyone know php here?
[22:18:36] <papanatas> me
[22:18:47] <coldhead> we don't like to talk php in here, xxx_
[22:18:49] <papanatas> a bit
[22:18:54] <papanatas> I can lend a hand
[22:19:01] <papanatas> hit me on private
[22:19:29] <papanatas> greg5green: now it says resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html.
[22:19:46] <systemfault> papanatas: JSONP? Nope..
[22:20:06] <papanatas> so I can't send data with jsonp?
[22:20:07] <systemfault> papanatas: jsonp basically creates a script tag and assign the url as itssrc
[22:20:09] <papanatas> to my .php?
[22:20:16] <greg5green> http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/9971/screenshot20130124at119.png papanatas
[22:20:27] <systemfault> papanatas: as a get, with the query string
[22:20:33] <greg5green> and yes, you wouldnt use CORS with jsonp
[22:20:49] <systemfault> papanatas: And also.. JSONP requires special handling on the server
[22:20:54] <greg5green> you use CORS to allow json
[22:21:04] <greg5green> but that was #2 on my list of why things weren't working for you
[22:21:04] <systemfault> Exactly, like greg5green said
[22:21:14] <papanatas> so I wasted a whole day!?!?!?
[22:21:26] <greg5green> what does your server return?
[22:22:31] <greg5green> if your server just returns json, just rewrite your ajax call
[22:22:32] <papanatas> Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html:
[22:22:36] <greg5green> using $.ajax instead of $.post
[22:23:08] <greg5green> although the request will only work in browsers that support CORS
[22:23:35] <papanatas> yes I'm using ajax!
[22:23:43] <papanatas> ;-D
[22:23:50] <papanatas> but that $.ajax should work
[22:23:59] <papanatas> no idea why it tells me that mime thing
[22:24:37] <greg5green> it was saying that because your server wasn't sending back jsonp
[22:24:58] <papanatas> how can I fix it?
[22:25:19] <greg5green> you have access to the server right? try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10827116/jsonp-request-resource-interpreted-as-script-but-transferred-with-mime-type-te
[22:25:20] <greg5green> that response
[22:25:22] <greg5green> see if it works
[22:27:38] <papanatas> that should be on my callback.php right?
[22:27:41] <papanatas> or on the one making the call?
[22:28:18] <greg5green> your php
[22:30:56] <papanatas> well, the error is not there anymore but now the scripts seems not to work
[22:33:26] <greg5green> then i'm guessing your php file isnt returning what the browser needs, but i cant really help you much more
[22:33:54] <papanatas> yes I will eventually figure it out
[22:33:55] <papanatas> thanks man
[22:34:43] <greg5green> I'm guessing you just need to format what your php is sending back to be jsonp
[22:34:46] <greg5green> but idk
[22:58:58] <guideX> anyone know how do I use isotope with dynamically created items?
[22:59:55] <the_jeebster> I'm setting an HTML button property as disabled on click but my form won't continue to submit even when I return true
[23:00:02] <the_jeebster> any insight?
[23:01:37] <guideX> so you want the button to be disabled after the button is clicked?
[23:02:16] <the_jeebster> guideX: I realized I should be listening to the submit event, not click
[23:02:33] <guideX> ok cool
[23:02:51] <soee> i have content that is added by script (its popover) now i would like to use click event on this content elements but it doesn't work, any idea why?
[23:04:57] <Nebros> is there anyone with know how in ajax + django and have a lot of time? :D
[23:33:21] <Nebros> is no one using django here?
[23:34:50] <greg5green> im sure someone does
[23:34:58] <greg5green> but having lots of time definitely scared them off
