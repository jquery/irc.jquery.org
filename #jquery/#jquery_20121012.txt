[00:00:17] <astropirate> iaj_, you can use the animation feature that comes with jquery UI
[00:00:24] <astropirate> it comes with some curves you can use
[00:01:20] <iaj_> astropirate: Is there a nice example for that somewhere?
[00:02:42] <NexHD> sorry i had some problems
[00:03:19] <NexHD> i want to ask why this $.post("test.php", function(data) return as data the entire data of html?
[00:05:23] <faraway> NexHD: probably because test.php is returning html ?
[00:05:28] <reloadz> hi! if you have time - plz help!
[00:05:28] <reloadz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12853851/jquery-ui-sortable-do-not-apply-to-just-edded-div-till-refresh
[00:07:21] <astropirate> iaj_, i have to run, but look at the animate() function that comes with jquery ui
[00:07:21] <faraway> reloadz: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-refresh
[00:08:31] <faraway> reloadz: not sure if this was your question ... but i guess because, it looks like that you add elements after you initialized the sortable.
[00:09:42] <chovy> what's the easiest way to set/get a cookie?
[00:09:42] <boulet101010_> reloadz, wtf we begin work at same time or whut =))
[00:10:14] <reloadz> from you.. i understand that u load page with elements and UI apply to them and when i add new elements to same loaded page the don't apply?
[00:10:20] <reloadz> boulet101010_: HI
[00:10:35] <reloadz> u=I
[00:10:47] <NexHD> can someone help me with this $.post("test.php", function(data) i want to get the input data , not the entire html code in data
[00:10:47] <NexHD> ?
[00:11:04] <boulet101010_> NexHD, ?!
[00:11:20] <reloadz> NexHD: ? $("form[name='catalog_form']").serialize()?
[00:11:37] <chovy> NexHD: you want the input in your callback?
[00:12:46] <anli> "b is undefined" using Jcrop
[00:13:00] <anli> What is "b is undefined"?
[00:13:30] <anli> http://pastebin.com/FySrM6Vy
[00:13:46] <faraway> reloadz: if you call container.sortable() ... it scanns for the container for the elements inside and creates a list of them, to do the sorting logic. if you add a new element to the container, sortable won't recognize that itself ... so you need to tell it that there are new elements. (exactly: that there changed something)
[00:14:37] <boulet101010_> reloadz, why haven't you mode like i said to you yesterday ? like $(".section").append($("<div...))
[00:39:36] <Foxhoundz> >>
[00:47:40] <mazzachre> Is there some clever way of finding out how many items are in a list?
[00:48:55] <nFFFFF> .length
[00:49:36] <mazzachre> uhm... $('ul').?
[00:50:32] <mazzachre> $('ul').children().length ?
[00:51:43] <nFFFFF> yea
[00:52:14] <nFFFFF> or $('ul li').length
[00:53:55] <Foxhoundz> this room needs a JS interpreter bot loaded with jQuery
[00:55:03] <Foxhoundz> then we could do this
[00:55:08] <Foxhoundz> >>$('<ul><li></li><li></li></ul').find('li').length;
[00:55:50] <nFFFFF> Its ok Ill tell you: 2

[01:17:09] <NexHD> hi
[01:17:17] <NexHD> can somebody help me please?
[01:18:27] <DukeDrake> NexHD: just state your question/problem ... and be patient ... someone might actually be able to help you
[01:21:15] <NexHD> i have if code in my php page , and i use a .post method in js page but how can i do give me true for php if code in my jquery page?
[01:22:40] <DukeDrake> NexHD: just send '1' or '0'  and evaluate in php
[01:23:10] <NexHD> if(data=='no') how is this?
[01:23:29] <DukeDrake> NexHD: might work as well
[01:23:46] <NexHD> can give me true if a put a if statament that echo "no" and "yes" for else
[01:23:47] <NexHD> ?
[01:24:02] <DukeDrake> NexHD: but if you send 1 or 0 , you can even go: if(data)
[01:24:08] <DukeDrake> (in php)
[01:25:41] <NexHD> i dont understand very good english, but this function with data no can give me true
[01:25:42] <NexHD> ?
[01:26:26] <DukeDrake> if(data=='no')   will give you true, if data is the string "no"
[01:27:11] <NexHD> if a put an alert box..she give me the entire html code page?
[01:27:15] <NexHD> is that good?
[01:28:06] <DukeDrake> no
[01:28:29] <DukeDrake> you probably want a value as answer, so alert() should give you that value
[01:28:37] <Xtrivity> hey guys: I was on here yesterday: not sure if Cork is online or not. But maybe someone can help me. I am working on pushState and popState's. I am wondering when someone hits the back button which would be the simplist way to reload the previous ajax using the current code i have here: http://pastie.org/5040296
[01:31:17] <Cork> Xtrivity: store the ajax object in the state for the page
[01:31:26] <Cork> $.ajax(state)
[01:32:54] <Xtrivity> Cork: current code i'm just using load()
[01:33:16] <Cork> Xtrivity: so store the url in the object
[01:33:33] <Cork> pushState({ url: url },
[01:34:41] <Cork> Xtrivity: alternatively if your pushing the ajax url to state
[01:34:50] <Cork> you can grab it from window.location
[01:35:11] <Cork> (when popstate fires the location is changed to the new url)
[01:43:07] <anli> Isnt this the way to show elements of two classes?: $('.raw-image, .cropped-image').show();
[01:43:24] <anli> They are two <tr> with display: none
[01:43:49] <Cork> it is
[01:43:55] <anli> ah, found it, they had got fubared class names, starting with .
[01:44:29] <anli> works better now
[01:44:39] <anli> I started to wonder if my mind had been going
[01:47:12] <Xtrivity> Cork: any reason this wouldn't work: http://pastie.org/5040517 ?
[01:47:47] <Cork> ya, your calling it page not name :)
[01:48:34] <Cork> Xtrivity: and btw you want to push the state in the success callback from load, not before its loaded
[01:49:47] <Xtrivity> ahh alright.
[01:51:24] <Xtrivity> Cork: you mind if i drop you a quick pm?
[01:52:00] <Cork> ok
[01:55:01] <Xtrivity> Cork: all problems. solved now except for if the back button his hit twice. Which switches state to null.
[01:55:18] <Cork> ya, first state is null
[01:55:29] <Cork> its the original page that you landed with
[01:55:45] <Xtrivity> hmmmm how could you track that.
[01:55:54] <Cork> as you didn't push the state for that entry it won't have a state
[01:56:10] <mazzachre> Is there some nice and easy way to find out how wide an element can be before and still be to the right of the prior element?
[01:56:55] <Cork> mazzachre: yes you can, but thats actually quite complex code
[01:57:19] <Cork> but basically you need to grab the width of the parent
[01:57:27] <Xtrivity> Cork: so is there a way to push a state upon entry?
[01:57:41] <Cork> mazzachre: then reduce its width with the width + border + margins of the elements that will be on the left
[01:57:48] <Cork> Xtrivity: no
[01:58:15] <Cork> Xtrivity: thats a flaw in the specs if you ask me, but thats how it is
[01:58:16] <Xtrivity> Cork: so essentially a double back will always lead to null?
[01:58:25] <Cork> no
[01:58:39] <Cork> the first enter from when you started to push state will always be null
[01:58:57] <Cork> how many times you can click back depends on how many states you pushed
[01:59:09] <Cork> Xtrivity: but window.location is an option
[01:59:18] <Cork> it will still change even for the first entry
[01:59:18] <Xtrivity> that's a page reload tho :|
[01:59:50] <mazzachre> Cork: Hmmm, ok... I guess I will put it off them, and continue to work to customers bad spec (fixed width layout, minimum client width specification, no changing of client fonts and no plugins...)
[02:03:55] <Xtrivity> Cork: this is frustrating. So essentially on first load there's no way to do anything with the null to track the location of the current window
[02:04:40] <Cork> Xtrivity: on('popstate', function() { $().load(window.location) });
[02:04:51] <Cork> if location contains the url
[02:04:57] <Cork> else no
[02:05:20] <Cork> window.location will change to the new target before popstate triggers
[02:09:43] <Xtrivity> Cork: http://pastie.org/5040794 (seems to not work correctly) am I missing something?
[02:10:32] <Cork> state !== null not "null"
[02:10:53] <Cork> Xtrivity: and if the location contains the data you need, you don't need to use obj.page
[02:11:23] <Cork> Xtrivity: do console.log(window.location) and see if that works for you (in popstate)
[02:12:50] <Xtrivity> Cork: that works: but here's how i've written it so can still use obj.page (makes more sense i think) http://pastie.org/5040824
[02:13:35] <Cork> not sure why you feel you need the state object at all
[02:13:52] <Cork> it just adds code complexity for you
[02:14:38] <Xtrivity> cause i'm on localhost and the path is like /client/work/example.com/about
[02:14:50] <Xtrivity> and it's easier to just get the last /about
[02:15:48] <nfff> On a site, would you ideally load jsut one js file, even though js in the file is for elements that aren't on current page, or would you split js file up and load the js on certain pages only
[02:15:49] <Cork> ah should prob add a website alias so you can test in a similar environment as the live site will be in
[02:15:58] <nfff> The reason I ask is to due to requests to server and caching
[02:16:27] <Xtrivity> Cork: i know - and i should say I'm lazy but i think it's causing me more work longterm haah
[02:17:58] <anli> How do I call Jcrop:s tellScaled method?
[02:21:49] <Cork> Xtrivity: if your using apache its dead simple, and REALLY worth the work
[02:22:02] <Cork> (nginx isn't harder)
[02:22:03] <Xtrivity> Yeah i Know.
[02:22:10] <Xtrivity> Cork: You're a champ! Thanks once again for your help. I have it all working
[02:22:15] <Xtrivity> appreciate it greatly!
[02:22:16] <Cork> np
[02:30:10] <sunbeam> is it possible to parse an xml file with jquery and get a few values?
[02:35:00] <Xtrivity> Cork: haha that gets so complicated when you have a .htaccess rewrite for index.php to go to /home because of the / if it's simply called directly from the .com (if that makes any sense)
[02:37:32] <Cork> Xtrivity: ya, rewrite rules can get hairy really fast
[02:38:33] <seutje> sunbeam: should be possible, jquery has some exceptions for handling xml
[02:38:56] <sunbeam> seutje: ok
[02:39:12] <sunbeam> but i need to read a document
[02:39:16] <sunbeam> read in a document
[02:40:36] <nfff> Did anyone input on my js files question? :>
[02:40:55] <enoch> get next focused element on blur?
[02:42:31] <eshlox> hi, How I can change the variable outside the function? like http://wklej.org/id/845840/ in img.onerror i want change something in STREAM
[02:42:33] <cusco> hi
[02:42:44] <cusco> how does one remove a css propertie from a element using jquery?
[02:42:56] <cusco> .css('attr','value') sets it
[02:42:59] <cusco> how to remove it?
[02:43:01] <Cork> eshlox: just change it
[02:43:13] <cusco> can't remove it?
[02:43:13] <seutje> .css('attr', null) iirc
[02:43:14] <Cork> eshlox: its in the scop chain
[02:43:16] <cusco> null
[02:43:44] <cusco> doesn't work null
[02:44:00] <cusco> background-color stays
[02:48:23] <keirlav87> i have 2 vars, a and b, and b contains the name 'a', can i pass a as an argument to a function by giving it b - rather than passing the value of b as a string?
[02:48:36] <timing> cusco: make it transparent
[02:48:40] <timing> or '' perhaps
[02:49:25] <Cork> keirlav87: as long as the function can still access the variable a sure
[02:49:37] <keirlav87> in php i can use ${$a} for example
[02:50:08] <anli> img.load('foo.png', function() {}); should be a correct way of loading image data, right?
[02:50:14] <anli> I got the image data as child contents of the img tag
[02:50:18] <anli> Which puzzles me a bit
[02:50:30] <Cork> ?eval var obj = { b: 10}; function test(in) { return obj[in]; }; print(test('b');
[02:50:44] <Cork> oh right the bot's down
[02:50:58] <Cork> anli: no
[02:51:06] <Cork> you just set the src attribute
[02:51:18] <Cork> img.prop('src', new-url')
[02:51:27] <anli> But I want an event to occur when the image has loaded
[02:51:36] <anli> I never use prop btw, always attr
[02:51:45] <Xtrivity> Cork: is there a way to do: $('#content').animate({ height: "200px" }, 200 ).load("home"); but have height: 100% of the content
[02:51:46] <Cork> thats img.load(funcrion() {});
[02:51:46] <anli> :)
[02:51:58] <anli> ah, true
[02:51:59] <Xtrivity> When I try height: "100%" it does nothing
[02:51:59] <anli> thx
[02:52:23] <Cork> Xtrivity: try height: 'auto'
[02:52:29] <anli> img.attr('src', 'foo.png').load(function(){}); then
[02:52:29] <Cork> that MIGHT work, but i'm not sure
[02:52:46] <Cork> you prob want to set the load first
[02:52:50] <anli> why?
[02:53:00] <Cork> as the browser will start to load the image as soon as you set the src
[02:53:09] <anli> Are you sure?
[02:53:12] <Cork> and that might mean (if it loads from cache) that you miss the load event
[02:53:15] <Cork> yes
[02:53:16] <anli> ok
[02:53:19] <anli> thx
[02:53:29] <fALSO> anyone uses DATATABLES ?
[02:53:40] <fALSO> Im having a problem when returning a empty result set
[02:54:00] <fALSO> he always is showing: PROCESSING, eternily
[02:54:01] <eshlox> Cork: uhm, ok, wrong example, what about this http://wklej.org/id/845843/ ;-) TypeError: STREAM[i] is undefined in img.error
[02:54:34] <keirlav87> cork: thanks for that, but i meant can actually pass the function whatever is held in 'a' by giving it 'b'?
[02:54:41] <keirlav87> in this case 'a' contains an object
[02:54:44] <Cork> eshlox: your still in the same scope hierarchy
[02:54:54] <keirlav87> the same as >> ${$a} in php
[02:55:21] <Cork> keirlav87: as long as you store it in an object yes
[02:55:28] <Cork> thats what my example was meant to show
[02:55:48] <Cork> var obj = { key; value }; obj['key']
[02:55:57] <NexHD> can help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/vPuMg/2/ ? my regex doesn`t work
[02:55:58] <NexHD> ?
[02:55:59] <Cork> * var obj = { key: value }; obj['key']
[02:56:21] <Cork> uh...
[02:56:36] <Cork> your grabing the usename outside the change event
[02:56:38] <anli> Trying to use img.width() inside the load handler, seems to give me 0
[02:56:42] <Cork> how is that meant to work?
[02:56:49] <anli> Ah, it must be display: block perhapt
[02:56:56] <anli> -t+s
[02:57:18] <Cork> anli: i think you need to delay your code
[02:57:22] <nFFFFF> On a site, would you ideally load jsut one js file, even though js in the file is for elements that aren't on current page, or would you split js file up and load the js on certain pages only
[02:57:23] <nFFFFF> The reason I ask is to due to requests to server and caching
[02:57:31] <Cork> i think load triggers before the browser sets width/height
[02:58:02] <keirlav87> yeah but we passed the function a string which it used to access the obj, providing it was within scope, what about passing obj itself by passing a var b = 'obj' - is that possible, or is it the same thing and i'm just not understanding, sorry lol
[02:58:10] <Cork> nFFFFF: things that can be generalized should be concated into one big js file
[02:58:27] <Cork> nFFFFF: if you need to have code that dynamically change thats better streamed each time
[02:58:30] <anli> Cork: How can it do that?
[02:58:49] <Cork> anli: setTimeout(function() {}, 0);
[03:01:38] <keirlav87> ah, i think i understand, so it relies upon the fact that accessing an object property using [] syntax, if there are no '' inside the square brackets js will look for the variable of the same name within that object?
[03:01:55] <keirlav87> so if i'm working in the global scope, I can pass window[a]?
[03:02:08] <Cork> yes
[03:02:24] <keirlav87> Cork: thanks, sorry took me awhile to figure it but i got there, cheers ^^
[03:02:41] <Cork> though your explanation isn't exactly correct, but the conclusion is
[03:02:45] <keirlav87> lol
[03:03:40] <Cork> keirlav87: though you should try to keep the number of functions and variables added to the global scope to a minimum
[03:05:40] <keirlav87> i try to generally, i find it useful with template objects though
[03:09:22] <Xtrivity> Hey guys: I am trying to have a smooth transition where between links the ajax page loads the height of the content without having to specify how high the page is. Here's the code i have: http://pastie.org/5041517 <- essentially I know you can get the height of a div. but how would you do it if content is dynamically loaded. height: 'auto" unfortunately does not seem to work. Open for suggestions
[03:09:22] <Xtrivity> / advice
[03:10:09] <enoch> get focused element when blur event is fired?
[03:11:11] <Xtrivity> enoch that wasn't directed at me I hope?
[03:11:37] <Xtrivity> as I am not bluring or focusing any events.
[03:14:02] <enoch> nope
[03:16:17] <keirlav87> if i have data returned from the server that i need a function bound to an event to use, how would i pass the data to my event handler without placing it in the global scope?
[03:16:32] <koiker> Hello all.. I'm using jquery along with socketio in one of my projects. On Firefox 15, I'm not able to append or use (in console.log) the string returned by the socket. However, if I do alert('some message') after using the string, it is getting appended or written to console. Any pointers on how to debug this issue is highly appreciated
[03:24:05] <kvarley> How can I check whether a div contains a string within a parent div? My HTML structure is like this: http://jsfiddle.net/rQnQv/
[03:24:36] <kvarley> I need to check if the contents of .listing-venue within .listing is equal to "A Random Venue"
[03:25:24] <keirlav87> I see the chasm in my understanding of js when i see SO questions like this - my own jq is akin to the question, but where can i learn the transition to write js of the style of the answer? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1841916/how-to-avoid-global-variables-in-javascript
[03:25:38] <Kambfhase> kvarley:  http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[03:26:00] <kvarley> Kambfhase: Thanks :)
[03:26:47] <Kambfhase> keirlav87: you have multiple ways of solving that.
[03:27:03] <Kambfhase> a) use .data() to append your data to the element
[03:27:27] <Kambfhase> b) use a closure to have the ajax callback and the event handler in the same scope
[03:27:55] <Kambfhase> c) make you handler globally accessible via a name and assing a proprty to that function
[03:28:08] <Kambfhase> you could also combine c with b
[03:31:46] <keirlav87> i tried wrapping both my ajax call and the event handler in the same closure, but i get client is not defined
[03:32:12] <Kambfhase> paste plz
[03:33:45] <koiker> Sending again.. Hello all.. I'm using jquery along with socketio in one of my projects.

[03:39:04] <keirlav87> sorry i was wrong i was declaring my var client within the scope of the success callback, not the scope of the closure
[03:40:21] <Kambfhase> :)
[03:42:54] <kvarley> How do I use contains() on $(this) ?

[04:44:39] <Kambfhase> thx
[04:47:36] <foraks> I'm curious: why does jQuery use typeof when it has $.type available? For example $.proxy takes context as second parameter, and jQuery checks if it's a string with typeof context === "string", but that would fail it someone provided "new String('x')" whereas $.type would return the right type.
[04:57:06] <seutje> foraks: so it would fail if someone did $.proxy(foo, new String('lol')); ?
[04:58:23] <foraks> as far as my understanding goes, yes
[04:58:26] <foraks> I know no one would do it
[04:58:35] <foraks> but who knows where people's strings come from
[05:00:03] <foraks> jQuery uses typeof everywhere but it knows that typeof sucks since it made $.type, so I don't get why keep using typeof
[05:00:06] <foraks> I'm sure I must be missing something
[05:08:22] <seutje> foraks: might just be an oversight, can't seem to find a bug filed already for that
[05:12:55] <NexHD> someone help me with this http://inset.zapto.org just put an username in field to see the error
[05:17:11] <Cork> NexHD: your script doesn't wait for dom ready
[05:17:53] <shoky> foraks: one reason could be.. that typeof much much quicker than $.type
[05:17:56] <Anticom> hi all
[05:17:59] <Cork> NexHD: and theres no field to put any username in
[05:18:20] <shoky> foraks: http://jsperf.com/typeof-vs-jquery-type-method
[05:18:29] <Anticom> what's the most simple way to check, wether a selection is empty in jq? e.g. $('#non-existing-element')
[05:18:51] <Cork> Anticom: .length
[05:18:59] <Anticom> ty :)
[05:19:27] <foraks> shoky: that's a good point. I guess performance is more important than accommodating people using weird strings
[05:19:29] <Cork> shoky: that difference is sick...
[05:20:10] <Cork> well at least when the difference is like 70x slower
[05:20:18] <foraks> and wow that's a crazy difference
[05:20:19] <foraks> yes
[05:20:39] <shoky> yeap surprised me
[05:21:58] <foraks> in my run it was 2514x slower
[05:22:13] <foraks> 596,032,954 vs 237,969
[05:23:36] <seutje> damn
[05:23:58] <shoky> i wonder if this means chrome's typeof is really fast or other's are optimized for $.type  ;p
[05:24:14] <shoky> i would assume the former
[05:24:26] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to change the class of specific div id on click and change it back on click again - http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/yt6Na/ - whats the best way of tracking its state? with a simple variable? 0 or 1 -- if/else
[05:27:01] <shoky> er nvm
[05:28:17] <JelmerD> Hi all, are here plugin:select2 users?
[05:28:25] <anli> If I want to get width and height of a loaded image, is a timer the way to go? I start to think that
[05:29:11] <_slax0r_> loaded image? loaded in what way?
[05:31:17] <Cork> var img = document.createElement('img'); img.onload = function() { setTimeout(function() { console.log(img.width); }, 0); }; img.src = url
[05:41:59] <NexHD> what is the problem on this script of this site http://inset.zapto.org (username: roscatu already exist)
[05:47:07] <Aphec> Hey Guys!
[05:47:34] <Aphec> i seem to be having a jquery conflict, nyone who can help me out for a sec?
[05:47:42] <NodeX> just ask lol
[05:47:56] <NodeX> asking to ask gets people nowhere
[05:47:57] <Aphec> http://pastebin.com/s9fU5xC4
[05:48:06] <Aphec> cant seem to find any errors
[05:48:18] <Aphec> however, when i use it, it screws up many of the other jquery in my joomla site
[05:48:37] <NodeX> that's not jquery
[05:48:43] <NodeX> it looks more like mootools to me
[05:49:22] <Aphec> hhmmmz
[05:49:26] <Aphec> strange thing is
[05:49:33] <Aphec> i used this exact same script on another website
[05:49:34] <Aphec> no problem
[05:49:40] <Aphec> copy pasted it, adjusted it
[05:49:44] <Aphec> site is fucked :p
[05:50:04] <NodeX> that's what you get for using joomla lol
[05:50:11] <Aphec> :(
[05:50:46] <tlkr> Joomla is such a pain in the ass
[05:51:01] <tlkr> Aphec, i've never used mootools but should it not be $(window)?
[05:51:17] <mazzachre> How to I get an event when the selected state of a specific radio button changes? I have my button selected (it have a special ID) and I have then tried on('select', function() {alert('CHANGED')}); on that, but nothing happens when it is selected or not...
[05:52:02] <Aphec> dont think so tlkr
[05:52:08] <Aphec> it works on another website ...
[05:53:03] <tlkr> mazzachre, the event you are looking for is change
[05:53:42] <tlkr> you could try it Aphec, can't hurt.
[05:54:03] <Aphec> $(window).addEvent('domready', function() {
[05:54:04] <Aphec> ?
[05:54:11] <tlkr> yeah
[05:55:05] <Aphec> mmm could it be that my mootools just doesnt load :p
[05:55:20] <tlkr> It could be that
[05:55:30] <tlkr> What browser are you using?
[05:56:22] <Aphec> chrome
[05:58:17] <Aphec> ok, joining the mootools channel was a bad idea
[05:58:20] <Aphec> they speak chinese there
[05:58:48] <mazzachre> tlkr: Which works when it is selected, but no event when it is unselected (by selecting some other radio button in same group)
[05:59:22] <NexHD> i have a problem the succes: function(msg) she give me the entire html page back and i dont want that
[06:00:06] <tlkr> mazzachre, the change event will fire everytime you change your selection as per this example: http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/
[06:01:54] <mazzachre> tlkr: http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/1/ This is what I am talking about... I want to know if one specific in my group is selected or not...
[06:02:46] <keirlav87> should you get into the habit of writing everything within a closure, or are there any negative effects, such as performance etc?
[06:03:19] <johnkpaul> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/2/
[06:03:20] <mazzachre> tlkr: I can't use the value of what I am doing as it is dynamic... I need to know when this specific radio button is checked or not (whether by click on itself or by click on any other in it's group)
[06:03:51] <johnkpaul> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/3/
[06:03:56] <johnkpaul> :)
[06:04:11] <krawchyk> also live is so '90s
[06:04:54] <Trisox> indeed :D
[06:04:57] <Trisox> use on
[06:04:57] <mazzachre> johnkpaul: Not quite... I need to do something specific in case it is unselected... So basically I need an "on not selected" event... Which does not seem to exist :(
[06:05:04] <tlkr> mazzachre, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/4/
[06:05:05] <Kambfhase> lvie is eruodance
[06:05:13] <Kambfhase> *live is eurodance
[06:05:31] <Cork> mazzachre: you can't know what that happens
[06:05:32] <johnkpaul> mazzachre: you'd have to write that manually
[06:05:38] <johnkpaul> there's no event called not-change
[06:06:22] <Cork> mazzachre: the normal solution is to bind an event listener for all the radio buttons of the same name, and go from there
[06:06:33] <Cork> and its how they'r intended to work
[06:06:43] <tlkr> Cork, like I did in my example above? ^^
[06:06:54] <NexHD> can someone review this code http://inset.zapto.org please?
[06:07:17] <Cork> tlkr: somewhat, except you shouldn't be using live
[06:07:30] <tlkr> Yeah thats my bad, s/live/bind
[06:07:49] <Cork> no you should be using delegated event handling
[06:07:50] <Cork> not bind
[06:08:34] <tlkr> Feel free to update my example Cork
[06:09:41] <Trisox> try http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/6/
[06:09:52] <keirlav87> tlkr: like this i think? http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/5/
[06:09:59] <boulet101010_> Neo--, which code?
[06:10:38] <Trisox> keirlav87: that doesnt use your id
[06:10:41] <Trisox> just change
[06:11:12] <Trisox> then you could just as well use $("input:radio").on('change', function(event) {console.log('boom'); });
[06:11:16] <keirlav87> sorry i think i missed part of the question, it does what tlkr's does without using deprecated .live that's all
[06:11:33] * tlkr is living in the past
[06:11:43] <Trisox> id go with http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/6/
[06:11:52] <boulet101010_> w00ps, NexHD which code?
[06:12:45] <krawchyk> Trisox that wont work for any elements added after onready in case op needs that
[06:13:12] <keirlav87> yeah, use $(document).on('change',*selector*,callback);
[06:13:23] <keirlav87> for elements which may be added to the dom post-ready
[06:13:29] <Cork> tlkr: http://jsfiddle.net/2x2g5/7/
[06:14:05] <krawchyk> pop that cork, now its a party
[06:14:38] <Trisox> he didnt want it on value base
[06:14:44] <Trisox> any who yes you could do that
[06:15:03] <Cork> by value is normally the best solution
[06:15:14] <Cork> as you need that to differ anyway
[06:15:19] <Trisox> keirlav87: it binds on $('input[name="radio1"]') so id any added to the group thats no big problem
[06:15:39] <Trisox> no need to use the whole document for that
[06:15:52] <Foxhoundz> I want to attach the same event handler to multiple DOM elements
[06:15:57] <Trisox> haha tlkr is living in the past
[06:15:58] <Trisox> :D
[06:16:08] <Foxhoundz> i.e. if the user presses enter in a text box as opposed to a <button> element, the same handler would be triggered via jQ
[06:16:25] <Cork> Trisox:  $('input[name="radio1"]') is waistful as it will add multiple event listeners to the document
[06:16:35] <sunbeam> an image banner with several links in it, is this possible to achieve?
[06:16:36] <sunbeam> or is this an outdated technique
[06:16:50] <tlkr> thank you Cork.
[06:16:53] <Cork> Foxhoundz: just use a form and the submit event
[06:17:01] <asker> hey guys, im trying to avoid popup link when holding shift and clicking, is that possible?
[06:17:20] <asker> so its just send to the link like u clicked normally without shift
[06:17:29] <Cork> asker: what happens there depends on the browser and the users configuration
[06:17:47] <Cork> but ya you can intentionally break there user interface if you like
[06:17:52] <asker> ofc but you can stil contorl that i guess
[06:18:04] <krawchyk> asker: imo if someone wanted to hold shift and click a link, just let them
[06:18:08] <Trisox> key detection could work
[06:18:25] <asker> no i want to use the shift+click for certain function
[06:18:26] <Cork> asker: $(document).on('click', 'a', function(event) { event.preventDefault; window.location = this.href; });
[06:18:44] <asker> needs to send just to the link without up popping the window
[06:19:01] <Cork> asker: just grab the click event check mouse state and stop the actions you don't want
[06:19:07] <Trisox> ah default you got a popup window
[06:19:44] <asker> well, how to stop the up popping action?
[06:19:45] <asker> :D
[06:19:49] <Cork> asker: i would be careful about doing that though, cause you will break the users expected experience
[06:19:59] <Cork> and that will be an annoyance
[06:20:11] <asker> np, interface just for certain users, not public
[06:20:18] <Cork> asker: i just gave you the code
[06:20:28] * Cork points at the line a minute ago
[06:20:34] <asker> kk ill try
[06:20:34] <Cork> *2
[06:21:22] <asker> doesnt work
[06:21:48] <Cork> event.preventDefault() will prevent it yes
[06:22:03] <Cork> if that doesn't your already doing something
[06:22:06] <johnkpaul> asker: did you copy and paste?
[06:22:12] <johnkpaul> preventDEfault is a funciton
[06:22:16] <johnkpaul> should be preventDefault()
[06:22:20] <Cork> ya
[06:22:24] <Trisox> ...
[06:22:34] <asker> ^^
[06:22:47] <johnkpaul> take every piece of code typed into IRC with a grain of salt, it's very rare that we type completely correct code ;-)
[06:22:57] <Trisox> is should event.preventDefault() event revering to the event in the function
[06:22:58] <asker> yap thats works out
[06:22:59] <asker> ty
[06:23:02] <asker> (y) <3
[06:23:03] <Cork> take every peace of code on irc as psudo-code
[06:23:13] <johnkpaul> yes, that's a better way to put it Cork
[06:23:38] <seutje> psh, slackers :P
[06:23:48] <Trisox> DE WAARHEID
[06:23:53] <Trisox> oh sorry
[06:23:54] <Trisox> :D
[06:24:15] <blackspotwiggins> Trisox++
[06:24:30] <seutje> Trisox: btw, be weary of using those sizzle selects like ":checkbox" or ":radio", ...
[06:24:47] <Trisox> true seutje
[06:24:50] <Trisox> there slow also
[06:24:59] <Trisox> pff this is driving me nuts i got jquery validation and on submit it shoots back up to the top of the page
[06:25:23] <Trisox> i use using ajax to submit the form
[06:25:38] <Trisox> submit buttons are mostly links or type button
[06:30:05] <TheBrayn> is there something like keyup which only recognises added or removed characters?
[06:31:53] <boulet101010_> whut?!?
[06:31:54] <Trisox> ?change
[06:32:03] <keirlav87> Trisox: have you tried using .submit(function(e) {e.preventDefault; }) to prevent the default action of the form trying to fire?
[06:32:47] <Trisox> yes that doesnt work
[06:32:58] <keirlav87> can you paste some code?
[06:33:35] <NexHD> if i have echo a form and then i have used ajax for live user check,how i exclud the form from back when i use succes:function(data)
[06:33:36] <NexHD> ?
[06:33:39] <Trisox> also i tried setting the option focusInvalid: false,
[06:34:40] <majd> Hey #jQuery - i feel that this should be painfully obvious, but i'm not sure why the icons on the buttons are not showing here: http://jsfiddle.net/majdal/LLBQu/
[06:34:49] <lennartalserda> Hi, anyone know why this jcarousel gets bugged when the slide id is 12 or higher? http://flora4art.com/product/orance
[06:35:53] <krawchyk> can you link to the jcarousel youre using?
[06:36:56] <lennartalserda> krawchyk: http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/
[06:37:03] <Trisox> majd:
[06:37:06] <Trisox> its icons
[06:37:10] <Trisox> not icon right
[06:37:22] <Trisox> change that and it would work of top of my head
[06:37:33] <Trisox> keirlav87: the example is kind of hard to extract..
[06:37:34] <krawchyk> Written by jan September 13th, 2006 at 10:10 am
[06:37:34] <majd> *buries head in shame*
[06:37:39] <krawchyk> lennartalserda: thats why
[06:37:40] <majd> thanks, Trisox
[06:37:41] <Trisox> :D
[06:37:51] <Trisox> any time majd
[06:38:10] <lennartalserda> krawchyk: any suggestions of which one I should implement?
[06:38:14] <krawchyk> https://github.com/jsor/jcarousel
[06:38:34] <krawchyk> and read http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/docs/reference/installation.html
[06:38:38] <lennartalserda> tnx, I'll try that one :)
[06:38:43] <krawchyk> same thing, just updated
[06:40:25] <majd> Why do the icons work with the <button> tag but not with <input type="button"> tag?
[06:41:37] <majd> http://jsfiddle.net/majdal/LLBQu/3/
[06:42:31] <Trisox> majd: input is text field mainly i think thats way
[06:45:31] <Absolute0> Is there an alternative to this.find('.someClass') ?
[06:45:42] <Absolute0> I remember seeing something like $('this .someClass')
[06:46:44] <Kambfhase> $('.class', this)
[06:47:03] <keirlav87> Trisox: have you made any progress with your problem - i think i am stuck with the same issue
[06:47:08] <Trisox> $(this).hasClass
[06:47:18] <keirlav87> are you adding the submit event declaratively?
[06:47:51] <Trisox> i got the form i check if its valid it shoots up thats before its submited
[06:48:27] <Trisox> basicly i got this
[06:48:28] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/3n9MR/
[06:48:54] <Absolute0> Kambfhase: is that preferred?
[06:48:55] <Trisox> the onclick is binded to the "submit" button
[06:49:09] <Kambfhase> Absolute0: no, buts its an alternative
[06:49:18] <Absolute0> aha
[06:49:20] <Absolute0> thanks
[06:49:23] <Trisox> $(this).hasClass(". someClass")
[06:49:42] <Trisox> http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[06:49:54] <Kambfhase> Trisox: .hasClass(9 is different from .find()
[06:49:55] <Trisox> lol remove the . before the class
[06:50:51] <Trisox> then $('div').filter('. someClass')
[06:51:07] <Kambfhase> .flter() is not the same as .find() either
[06:51:16] <Trisox> no duh
[06:51:49] <keirlav87> I have a form that is added to the dom after a certain event and i am trying to bind to the submission of the form - http://jsfiddle.net/WgZXz/
[06:52:05] <keirlav87> i see the event is logged in console, and the alert('submitted'); fires
[06:52:16] <keirlav87> but the page still reloads, as though preventDefault isn't working
[06:52:44] <Trisox> keirlav87:  http://jsfiddle.net/3n9MR/
[06:53:11] <keirlav87> can you see why my preventDefault isn't working?
[06:53:15] <Trisox> i used that the class is on the link that submits the form
[06:53:17] <keirlav87> i'll take alook at your fiddle now
[06:53:40] <Trisox> keirlav87: use e.preventDefault();
[06:53:46] <Trisox> not e.preventDefault;
[06:53:47] <Trisox> :D
[06:54:07] <keirlav87> LOL
[06:54:12] <keirlav87> what an eejit :(
[06:54:15] <keirlav87> thanks
[06:54:33] <Trisox> :D
[06:57:47] <boulet101010_> was ist ein eejit?
[06:58:28] <Trisox> it means fool nitwit etc
[06:58:36] <boulet101010_> which language?

[06:59:33] <Trisox> lol
[06:59:51] <boulet101010_> tah't whut i towft
[07:02:23] <fALSO> no one uses jquery datatable ?
[07:02:34] <fALSO> i cant figure out anywhere on the site/documentation
[07:02:51] <fALSO> what should the server side json  respond when there are no records
[07:03:25] <fALSO> anyone willing to help me out ?
[07:07:55] <Kambfhase> Is there a way of forwarding one Deffered to another, only with preprocessed results?
[07:08:33] <docmur> I have some div's generated from php that show up on my webpage.  Inside these Div's is a button, randomily when I click this button is wont trigger the click event, if I research the page it's fine.  What would cause an issue like that?
[07:08:44] <faraway> fALSO: (i don't know the plugin, so it is just a guess)  did you try the obvious? returning 0 for the total count and en empty array for the records.
[07:10:15] <docmur> This is the actual code, is there something clearly wrong I'm doing? http://pastebin.com/XifejMdX
[07:12:58] <Kambfhase> lag.reset == true ? flag.reset = false : flag.reset = true;
[07:13:03] <Kambfhase> I loled
[07:13:33] <ryanneufeld> lol
[07:13:49] <ryanneufeld> flag = !flag @Kambfhase amirite?
[07:13:50] <lennartalserda> krawchyk: it turned out to be this issue: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7193
[07:14:09] <Kambfhase> yeah
[07:14:23] <Kambfhase> docmur: you code could be DRYed up a bit
[07:14:54] <goldstar> hey guys, when I scroll to the bottom of my window $(window).scrollTop() returns 815, yet $(window).height() is 907 - What gives ?
[07:15:05] <docmur> fair enough but the issue is something to do with the $('$userBar button).bind();  It's almost as if it's not binding click all the time
[07:15:09] <ryanneufeld> docmur: also, your code could benefit from caching and chaining
[07:16:01] <docmur> fair enough
[07:16:18] <ryanneufeld> are you building a query string?
[07:17:07] <ryanneufeld> docmur: you know you an use an object for that right?
[07:17:13] <docmur> yes, there is a function that builds a div with toggles as buttons in it and the code I posted reads the buttons when they toggle and when you click submit that is sent to another script
[07:17:13] <ryanneufeld> docmur: see ?ajax
[07:17:25] <ryanneufeld> no bot... eff
[07:17:51] <ryanneufeld> docmur: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:18:12] <docmur> How would ajax be any better then load or $.post?
[07:18:26] <docmur> I was using it before and got told to switch to load or post
[07:20:09] <faraway> goldstar: that the content has a height of 1722 ?
[07:20:53] <goldstar> faraway: how did you know that ?
[07:21:15] <goldstar> faraway: ah you added them
[07:21:23] <faraway> goldstar: ;)
[07:22:20] <goldstar> faraway: well, what im trying to do is once the user is at the bottom of the page then an ajax request is made
[07:22:30] <goldstar> still trying to figure it out
[07:23:47] <faraway> goldstar: if( $(window).height() + $(window).scrollTop() >  contentheight-threshold )  ?
[07:24:12] <goldstar> faraway: hah, just did that !
[07:24:22] <goldstar> thanks
[07:26:11] <Krambiorix> hi, i get an error:  Permission denied to access property 'toString'   , but i never use toString...
[07:30:50] <wroathe> Hey all... Is there a bug with the on() method with selectors? When I do something like $('ul.primary-nav li').on('click', '> a', function (e) {});
[07:30:58] <wroathe> the > a doesn't work as intended
[07:31:10] <faraway> wroathe: which jquery version ?
[07:31:31] <wroathe> 1.7.2

[07:41:39] <docmur> I got the problem down to $('#userBarAction').show() isn't always showing the box
[07:42:48] <Aamir_> seutje:  can I pm?
[07:42:58] <seutje> Aamir_: uhm, sure
[07:43:02] <seutje> FINE LEAVE!
[07:43:12] <xec> lol
[07:43:29] <xec> how rude
[07:43:34] <seutje> bot-t: tell aamir_ well that was rude!
[07:43:35] <bot-t> seutje, Okay.
[07:44:48] <Aamir> seutje: can you plz pm me the password for ot?
[07:45:24] <seutje> Aamir: there's a password? o.O
[07:45:32] <Brodingo> ha no its whitelist
[07:45:35] <Brodingo> must be  a problem
[07:45:50] <Aamir> seutje: yes, irc says that u need to pwd to join ot room
[07:45:50] <faraway> shinta42: http://webcheatsheet.com/javascript/loops.php
[07:46:22] <TheBrayn> why doesn't javascript have a foreach loop?
[07:46:46] <kurol> ecmascript does
[07:47:04] <Brodingo> according to mdn 1.6 has it
[07:47:09] <faraway> TheBrayn: for ( key in object )  ?
[07:47:29] <TheBrayn> does this work?
[07:47:54] <kurol> you have to guard against accidentally accessing some properties, but yeah
[07:48:01] <shinta42> faraway:am i allowed to manipulate strings as arrays directly?
[07:48:06] <faraway> TheBrayn: yes but you should object.hasOwnProperty(key) to check if it is valid
[07:49:03] <jwmann> Is there something to count the number of object in a jQuery selection?
[07:49:15] <BillCriswell> jwmann: .length
[07:49:19] <TheBrayn> faraway: so this won't work for arrays?
[07:49:21] <jwmann> Merci
[07:50:09] <faraway> TheBrayn: one moment
[07:50:25] <TheBrayn> well, I'm mostly using coffeescript
[07:50:27] <TheBrayn> which has foreach
[07:51:48] <TheBrayn> http://i.imgur.com/wAMQ9.png <- wtf
[07:51:54] <faraway> TheBrayn: new browsers have .forEach( callback ) for arrays and for older ones you can add the functionality https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[07:52:11] <faraway> TheBrayn: but it isn't a loop
[07:53:50] <TheBrayn> why on hell does firebug do this?
[07:54:22] <Kambfhase> did you insert a <revert text direction> character?
[07:54:35] <TheBrayn> maybe firebug thought I did
[07:54:39] <TheBrayn> well anyway
[07:54:40] <invisib> I've got a data-gallery-iteration attribute defined in my template, when I try to attach rel="gallery1", rel="gallery2", etc. to it, I do so like this:    $('.gallery a').attr('rel', 'gallery' + $(this).closest('.gallery').data('gallery-iteration')).fancybox();   but that data attr keeps coming back undefined.
[07:54:41] <TheBrayn> bye
[07:54:49] <Cork> TheBrayn: you need to be picky about ; in firebug
[07:55:11] <seutje> invisib: what do you think "this" is in that context?
[07:55:17] <invisib> I think it's the anchor
[07:55:19] <seutje> coz it looks like it'll resolve to the window object
[07:55:31] <invisib> And I'm trying to get the .gallery element that contains it
[07:55:40] <invisib> But I suspect it's not doing that. :)
[07:56:00] <invisib> Why would it resolve to window?
[07:56:14] <seutje> user .attr('rel', function(i, attr) { /* now "this" is your anchor */ });
[07:56:15] <invisib> If I'm within $('.gallery a'), then shouldn't it bind to that?
[07:56:21] <seutje> ur not within that
[07:56:35] <invisib> Hrm
[07:56:41] <invisib> What am I within?
[07:56:43] <seutje> your $(this).closest(....) is parsed in the current scope
[07:56:57] <invisib> oh, it's parsed to document right?
[07:57:23] <seutje> passing a function to attr creates a scope (which is called with $.proxy iirc)
[07:57:24] <invisib> $(document).ready...   $('.gallery a')... $(this).data...
[07:57:39] <invisib> O yah?
[07:57:49] <invisib> Well, thanks for the help
[07:57:51] <BillCriswell> seutje: Good tip, wasn't aware of that. I'd end up with an each loop for that.
[07:58:05] <seutje> $(document).ready(FUNCTION(){}); $('.gallery a').attr('rel', NO FUNCTION)
[07:58:08] <seutje> see the diff?
[07:58:28] <seutje> I capsed it for emphasis :D
[07:58:49] <invisib> Yeah I see it now
[07:59:02] <invisib> TIL
[07:59:33] <invisib> Damn now I can't write the function :D
[07:59:52] <invisib> Sucks because I have the data attr in my templates right
[08:00:14] <invisib> Maybe I can just do a simple for loop
[08:01:46] <invisib> Herpderp I can't even print out the iteration in JS
[08:02:09] <invisib> seutje: Think this will work? 	$('.gallery a').attr('rel', 'gallery' + for(i=1, i < 0, i++) { PRINT I?! }).fancybox();
[08:02:20] <seutje> holy poop
[08:02:22] <invisib> As a generic iterator
[08:02:28] <invisib> Ah crap I suck don't I?
[08:02:47] <seutje> I'd be surprised if that worked
[08:03:01] <invisib> Can't figure out how to print that iterator or I'd try it
[08:03:12] <seutje> invisib: the first argument to the function you pass in .attr is the index
[08:04:19] <seutje> $('.foo').attr('someAttr', function(i, val) { console.log('Item number ' + i.toString() + ' contained value "' + val + '".'); });
[08:04:46] <seutje> (whatever the function returns is what is used as value for the current item
[08:05:26] <seutje> so $('*').attr('my-special-counter', function(i, val) { return i; }); would set a counter on every element in the page, counting in the order they were found
[08:05:30] <docmur> If I have a DIV in my index.php file and the very first call in my JS is to show that box and it doesn't show would that be a bug or a issue, sometimes it shows, sometimes it doesn't
[08:06:59] <invisib> seutje: Thanks for all your help. Out of curiousity, why doesn't this return anything? for(i=1, i < 0, i++) { return i; })
[08:07:12] <invisib> Shouldn't it create 1,2,3,4,5 etc?
[08:07:29] <seutje> invisib: calling return in a loop just bails, doesn't it?
[08:08:03] <seutje> invisib: didn't your example give a syntax error?
[08:08:39] <pachet> also, the block would never be hit
[08:08:44] <pachet> because i is always > 0
[08:08:44] * syntax error
[08:08:45] <pachet> ;[
[08:08:50] <seutje> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token for
[08:09:02] <invisib> Yeah
[08:09:18] <invisib> $('.gallery a').attr('rel', 'gallery' + function(i, val) { return i; }).fancybox();     doesn't work :(
[08:09:33] <seutje> no not like that
[08:09:37] <invisib> I think it actually prints out the function in the rendered html :(
[08:09:51] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to change the state/class of a particular div based on whether it has or has not been clicked. At the moment, it doesn't seem to be working, although before when it was clicked, my drop down at least worked. http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/yt6Na/5/ - Any ideas?
[08:10:00] <seutje> $('.gallery a').attr('rel', function(i, val) { return 'gallery' + i; }); like that :)
[08:10:13] <invisib> Ah, no plus
[08:10:15] <seutje> u can't concat a string and a function :P
[08:10:20] <seutje> it'll just troString() it, prolly
[08:10:36] <seutje> ?eval 'lol' + function(i, val) {return i;};
[08:10:41] <bot-t> seutje: "lolfunction (i, val) {\n    return i;\n}"
[08:10:49] <seutje> yup, just toString()s it
[08:11:07] <seutje> oh, it beautified it somewhere along the way :D
[08:12:21] <brenda> hey guys im using this function to edit a contact by id.. im getting the json and everything but form some reason im not being send to correct url when i press the button.. http://pastie.org/5044353
[08:16:50] <dualcore> brenda: ajax is not for redirecting you to another url
[08:17:19] <brenda> dualcore:  i mean this url : uri,
[08:18:22] <brenda> eventhough i checked is fine with firebug.. when i press the button nothing is happening
[08:19:25] <dualcore> brenda: you're not looking at the right piece of code.  that doesn't have to do with redirection.  ajax is for doing things live in the background on the same page
[08:20:48] <brenda> dualcore:  firebug shows everything is fine.. but im not seeing
[08:20:50] <embersoaker> Hey, I am using the auto complete widget. If a user manually enters a value instead of selecting one from the drop down I would like to validate what they typed before submitting the form. I know how to check for manual entry, I think I would need to trigger the search function again but I'm not sure how to check the results of the search event to see if something actually was returned
[08:22:04] <docmur> Now only chrome seems not to fire the show(), is there a known issue with Chrome now working with the show() function?  IE and Firefox seem fine
[08:22:09] <embersoaker> https://gist.github.com/3879732 is what i currently have
[08:22:30] <eshlox> how i can track when image can't be loaded (404?) or someone change src example using firebug and then load another image?
[08:22:43] <dualcore> brenda you would have to setup an example to show.  is your issue with that function you pasted?  what do you expect to happen?  based on that code you pasted alone you wouldn't see any output.  what does the resp function do that is called on success?
[08:24:34] <dualcore> i mean waht is resp (typos)
[08:24:58] <dualcore> i meant to say that isn't enough code to troubleshoot your issue
[08:25:56] <brenda> dualcore:  once i click a buttong i should bring all the data in a form via json
[08:26:51] <brenda> dualcore:  when i hit the button nothing happens.. but when i check in the browser i can see the response and i get the data.. for some reason im not seeing this in the form
[08:29:07] <dualcore> brenda: i'm not sure sorry.  maybe someone else can help.  i would setup an example with the form and button and everything that you can link
[08:32:14] <wolfehr> anyone know a consistent way to get image height (of a dynamically heighted image) in all browsers without all of the loading issues?
[08:32:15] <dualcore> brenda: you could set it up in http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:32:28] <wolfehr> loads of stuff about on it, nothing consistent however
[08:35:15] <QuakePhil123> I'm using $(window).height() and it works in chrome just fine.  But in explorer 9, I get value of 0.  Any clue what I am doing wrong?
[08:35:58] <arnogues> let the image loading, and check the height on the load of the iamge
[08:36:19] <arnogues> or img.naturalHeight and img.naturalWidth return real width and height but doesn't work under IE6/7
[08:36:27] <wolfehr> arnogues: I've used the img.onload event, however it doesn't trigger consistently in IE
[08:36:41] <tlkr> QuakePhil123, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5692746/window-height-fails-on-ie9 that seems to answer your question
[08:37:27] <QuakePhil123> tlkr: Thanks.  Just tried that now, and I'm getting 0 for $(window).innerHeight() as well
[08:37:42] <tomasm-> hi, what's the easiest way to implement file uploads done via ajax? I have a small block on my page that I want uploaded when a file is uploaded, not the whole page. basically I want a user to provide a picture and then get an autopreview without refreshing the page...
[08:37:49] <QuakePhil123> (innerHeight() works in chrome just as height() does)
[08:38:03] <tomasm-> I am returning an html block, not JSON
[08:38:11] <brenda> im getting uncaught exception: FID is undefined in firebug.. what that does mean
[08:38:59] <QuakePhil123> tomasm-: You can probably use an iframe to achieve this.  Check http://www.ajaxf1.com/tutorial/ajax-file-upload-tutorial.html
[08:39:02] <tlkr> QuakePhil123, guess that's stackoverflow for you. I dont have IE on here so I can't help any more atm :-(
[08:39:19] <QuakePhil123> tomasm-: (That url was one of the first results on google)
[08:40:25] <tomasm-> QuakePhil123, will malsup's jquery form plugin work? I am confused about this thing referring to <textarea>
[08:40:33] <tomasm-> I just want to return html, not json
[08:41:19] <goldstar> eveytime the user scrolls to the bottom of the page an ajax request is fired. However, at the moment if I scroll to the bottom quickly then multiple ajax requests are sent. Is there any way I can prevent any further ajax requests being made if one is already in progress ?
[08:41:53] <QuakePhil123> goldstar: Wrap it in a function which sets/checks a static/global variable
[08:42:36] <tomasm-> i will look at the examples and try them out...
[08:43:16] <goldstar> QuakePhil123: thanks, will try it out
[08:47:29] <QuakePhil123> tlkr: Got it to work with <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"> <html>
[08:47:36] <QuakePhil123> Got the hint from this page: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12426
[08:47:39] <QuakePhil123> Oh explorer...
[08:47:40] <klj613> if i got currentRow as a <tr> how do i select the next <tr> ?
[08:50:01] <Kambfhase> ?next @ klj613
[08:50:02] <bot-t> klj613, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[08:54:15] <klj613> Kambfhase, thanks
[08:55:48] <ohcibi> i have a big json string which has some nested objects, when parsing it some id-attributes are parsed as undefined, i can parse small snippets of these parts and the attributes are not undefined, anyone an idea whats the problem?
[08:59:16] <GoGoGarrett> $("body").off 'click', "#add1", @add_new_menu_item        <- shouldn't this turn off the click handler for the element #add1 ?
[08:59:30] <rgr> look at the specifics of the raw data which ends up undefined.
[09:06:06] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: that doesn't look like valid JS
[09:06:11] <Zzaichik> GoGoGarrett: I hope you didn't copy and paste that..
[09:06:13] <GoGoGarrett> it's coffeescript
[09:06:23] <GoGoGarrett> but either wy
[09:06:24] <Zzaichik> it's still gross
[09:06:39] <GoGoGarrett> $("body").off("click", "#add1", this.add_new_menu_item)
[09:06:42] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: maybe try #coffeescript ?
[09:06:51] <GoGoGarrett> It's a jquery question regarding the off message
[09:06:51] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: hard to help you debug code that isn't code
[09:07:00] <GoGoGarrett> method*
[09:07:01] <ryanneufeld> ?off
[09:07:02] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, .off() - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[09:07:06] <GoGoGarrett> Right.
[09:07:16] <Zzaichik> To answer your question, yes.
[09:09:22] <GoGoGarrett> Coffeescript is still code, doesn't magically write code for you ryanneufeld
[09:12:58] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: not my point
[09:13:20] <GoGoGarrett> My point was I was asking a jquery related question about a method and got a smartass remark that doesn't help anything really.
[09:13:30] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: I wasn't being a smartass
[09:13:41] <ryanneufeld> you pasted a line of code I did not recognize
[09:14:18] <ryanneufeld> at any rate, to unbind you need the reference to the previously bound function handler
[09:15:17] <nitzer> hey! i have a rare problem, var fld_unique_field = $('#unique_field'); returns an html string, not the jquery object, any idea why?
[09:15:46] <pifantastic> nitzer: can you reproduce in a fiddle?
[09:16:31] <ryanneufeld> nitzer: how are you determining that it's an html string?
[09:21:35] <dualcore> nitzer: it should return the object - see it work here: http://jsfiddle.net/FsJkL/
[09:23:18] <Matthew__> hello, im authoring a hierarchical chart widget, and am having some problems, with .draggable / .droppable, in the droppables drop event, i remove the dom elements, and get an error: TypeError: e(this).data("draggable") is undefined                         here is an example,  http://jsfiddle.net/mfeerick/An7c6/   just drag a child item to another parent
[09:27:48] <Matthew__> the chart should dissappear, but if you look in firebug you can see the error
[09:28:06] <Matthew__> basically i once i have sorted the error, i can then redraw the grid
[09:29:58] <btreecat> how do I know if $.getJSON() is calling the right local url?
[09:30:35] <pifantastic> btreecat: what do you mean? You're the one passing the URL to $.getJSON
[09:30:57] <pifantastic> btreecat: if it's a relative URL, it's relative to the current URL, unless you have a <base> tag
[09:31:10] <btreecat> pifantastic: ok it is relative
[09:31:40] <docmur> what would the right JSON syntax be for this:
[09:31:45] <Xtrivity> Hey guys. Im sure this is just a stupid little error - but I can't figure it out: http://pastie.org/5045094 when I click on the home button the initial time the .animate function does not work - yet if i click on the link a second time it activates the .animation(). Im boggled because it still loads the remote content.
[09:32:02] <docmur> {"id": $('#id').val()} where id.val() is a number
[09:32:04] <Huanghe11> I need know the jquery mobile developer
[09:32:18] <btreecat> pifantastic: I am trying to read this data 128.173.193.10:8080/MugShot/vehicle/locate/autocomplete/Shrp2
[09:32:22] <docmur> I  wnat to post it to a php script
[09:32:45] <pifantastic> btreecat: $.getJSON('/MugShot/vehicle/locate/autocomplete/Shrp2')
[09:32:59] <btreecat> pifantastic: thankyou!
[09:33:10] <pifantastic> docmur: use a JSON library
[09:33:28] <pifantastic> JSON.stringify({id: $('#id').val()});
[09:33:34] <pifantastic> ?g JSON2
[09:33:36] <bot-t> pifantastic, douglascrockford/JSON-js  GitHub - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[09:34:41] <nzerox> hey guys
[09:34:43] <NoiseEee> docmur: var xhr = $.ajax({url:'/place/to/post.php',type:'POST',data:{id:$('#id').val()});
[09:34:46] <nzerox> how can i get this to work
[09:34:47] <nzerox> http://pastebin.com/G8gbMvx8
[09:35:14] <nzerox> i need to update the age variable with the value i get from the ajax call
[09:37:27] <quicksilver> ajax is asychronous, nzerox
[09:37:39] <quicksilver> that's what the 'a' is for.
[09:38:18] <nzerox> quicksilver: i know, but is there no way to do what i am trying?
[09:38:34] <ryanneufeld> Matthew__: in chrome I get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined "
[09:38:40] <quicksilver> you could make it synchronous
[09:38:45] <quicksilver> although normally that's a very bad idea.
[09:39:06] <quicksilver> better is to rewrite the code which calls "getMinAge" to understand that it will be asynchronous and need a callback.
[09:41:26] <Matthew__> ryanneufeld: var o = $(this).data('draggable').options;   it appears to be on this line
[09:42:29] <Matthew__> looks like draggable tries to call the "stop" event, on DOMElements which dont exist
[09:53:17] <Matthew__> seems i have run into this bug in jquery-ui : http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8437
[09:53:46] <Matthew__> i have fixed it on my copy of jquery-ui, so i will have to figure out how to check it in
[09:59:17] <goldstar> see: http://jsfiddle.net/mGjKB/  - The locked variable returns undefined even though its set to false. How do I retreieve the scroller object;s variable and not the $(document)
[10:13:07] <barhom> Is there a more appropriate place than here, to paste a very small jquery/html5 job or is there another channel where its better suited?
[10:14:16] <Xtrivity> Cork: you around my any chance - having a small issue with the pushstate problems.
[10:17:18] <coder7of9> does jquery slow down web pages (applications) by constantly iterating and monitering the dom? is an event driven event handler setup more reliable : like setup onmouseover
[10:18:35] <Brodingo> coder7of9 jquery uses event delegation
[10:18:43] <Brodingo> ?on @ coder7of9
[10:18:44] <bot-t> coder7of9, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:20:57] <coder7of9> if i set a hanlde using jquery i cannot see the event when i call elem.onclick  vs plain js addEventListener
[10:21:05] <coder7of9> *handler
[10:21:26] <coder7of9> so does it create a cache?
[10:22:40] <barhom> http://i.imgur.com/MuM4l.png < need this made in html5/jquery/css, paying for the job done, privmsg me (I have more work as well, I need to find somebody that can help me do some work on request)
[10:23:18] <coder7of9> does jquuery create its own framework of all elements and then listens to the dom to match events or does it actualy set the event to the elem (not its framework elements)
[10:29:47] <blendedbychris> how can one use .wrap but also apply stuff to the .wraper
[10:29:49] <blendedbychris> wrapper*
[10:29:57] <blendedbychris> I'm guessing i shouldn't be using .wrap :)
[10:29:58] <ohcibi> how is it possible to not autohide tooltips when leaving the element with the mouse?
[10:36:06] <blendedbychris> why does't .after work in this situation http://pastie.textmate.org/private/hgkvtidamqz5b6ovhghfug
[10:37:06] <blendedbychris> oh wait hrm that wouldn't work because it's not the specific wrapped dom element
[10:39:38] <aniasis> does anyone know of a plugin to convert an imagemap to a set of anchor tags?

[10:42:52] <TelFiRE> any performance conerns or anything
[10:45:33] <aniasis> what is the benefit of using $el.on as opposed to $el.live
[10:46:34] <alcuadrado> does the lastest version of jqueryui support AMD?
[10:50:38] <djntd> does the lastest version of jqueryui support ARM?

[10:52:33] <NexHD> hi
[10:53:01] <NexHD> i want to ask if this is correct? $("#one", "#two")?
[10:53:12] <systemfault> NexHD: Nope
[10:53:14] <docmur> if I use php to generate <div class"action" userId="a3"> and then in the callback of a post append that to a <div class="user" userId="u3"> how do I locate the <div> I appeneded and either destroy of remove it.  Right now if the user hits the button twice on the parent div it will append 2 of the children, not what I wnat
[10:53:18] <TelFiRE> I'm doing a form slider, in order to do it I made the elements that are sliding, position: absolute. But as a result there is a fixed height, it won't expand the page down. any way around this
[10:53:28] <systemfault> NexHD: Do you mean $("#one, #two") ?
[10:54:18] <eph3meral> docmur: it is, in general a Bad Idea to extend the DOM like that
[10:54:43] <eph3meral> docmur: use hidden input elements, or at worst, use the jQuery data attributes
[10:55:19] <systemfault> aniasis: .on does both normal event handling and event delegation (Like .live)
[10:55:19] <eph3meral> docmur: a better idea would be <div class="action" id="user_id_a3">
[10:55:45] <JFranks> Days later.. .spinner() STILL needs fixing.. :) http://jsfiddle.net/ZMe77/ (bottom example)
[10:55:52] <eph3meral> docmur: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ if you must
[10:55:57] <docmur> okay then instead of appending it what should i do to locate the new div under the parent, the idea is that the buttons "unfold" from the parent on the button click, this is the code right now for i: http://pastebin.com/NiUShuDB
[10:56:20] <eph3meral> docmur: be creative?
[10:56:27] <eph3meral> docmur: jsfiddle or it didn't happen
[10:57:22] <eph3meral> docmur: it sounds a bit like your app is not yet well thought out
[10:57:27] <eph3meral> or at least, not yet well structured
[10:57:34] <eph3meral> a3, u3 - I dislike it already
[10:57:53] <docmur> thos are just id codes given to div bars based on there location
[10:58:45] <eph3meral> docmur: jQuery IMO is just a support library these days - you still need to either build a good app structure or use a "framework" like backbone, ember, spine, etc
[10:59:15] <eph3meral> docmur: the issue here is that A) it's not well formed to the DOM and B) it's not DRY
[10:59:30] <eph3meral> you shouldn't really need to make some kind of weird distinction between a3 and u3 for example
[10:59:51] <eph3meral> a simple $('.userEdit .save).on('click' type deal should be what you want to go for
[11:00:43] <eph3meral> docmur: I use backbone myself, which makes it so that views are encapsulated, so I can essentially always rely on my selectors being exactly where I expect them to be and I have no worries of catching extra similar selectors that may also exist elsewhere in the DOM
[11:02:03] <eph3meral> docmur: you may prefer something other than backbone, but either way, I still recommend looking in to one of these types of frameworks - it doesn't save a ton of code, and in fact, you sometimes end up with more code than maybe you would if you did it by the seat of your pants - but things are organized and encapsulated and there's great separation of business and display logic to be had
[11:02:27] <eph3meral> docmur: http://codebrief.com/2012/01/the-top-10-javascript-mvc-frameworks-reviewed/ <- a bit out of date already, but still relevant
[11:03:02] <eph3meral> docmur: good organization reduces your coding time, even if there are more lines of code - counter intuitive I know, but it's true
[11:03:54] <eph3meral> docmur: i can't speak for other frameworks, as I said, but backbone is nice in that you can pick and choose - to start, you may wish to only make use of backbone views and ignore the models and router
[11:08:02] <w0rldmaker> when i bind an event using delegate() the contents of the function seems to execute during bind
[11:08:06] <w0rldmaker> is that proper functionality?
[11:11:12] <masterfla> hi guys I am some issue with reloading some content on a div
[11:11:14] <docmur> Meh figured it out, the solution was one line, $('#userBar').find('#a' + $(event.currentTarget).attr('userId')).remove();  Then after that I just append the new element
[11:11:17] <docmur> problem solved
[11:12:00] <masterfla> this what i do
[11:12:01] <masterfla> http://pastebin.com/KfQpiMzM
[11:12:09] <masterfla> so the content dissapear
[11:12:17] <masterfla> i can see the loading icon
[11:12:31] <masterfla> but cannot get the new content to display with the fadein animation
[11:12:42] <masterfla> am i missing something
[11:18:27] <KWhat_Work> "onSelect  function - the function to call when a date is selected":  You would think that would get fired after you pick your date right?
[11:19:07] <TelFiRE> This is working a bit weird in the codepen, but my main question is this: how can I make the height animate smoothly instead of just instantly getting larger when you hit next and the next form is bigger than the last? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jLGeb
[11:21:05] <TelFiRE> should I just like show it, getHeight and then set height to 0 immediately and animate to the height I got?
[11:27:15] <coder7of9> i set a handler using    why when i call elem.onclick do i get null $(.cname).bind('click'...
[11:27:52] <coder7of9> oops sorry... better   i set a handler using  $(.cname).bind('click'...     why when i call elem.onclick do i get null
[11:31:13] <Kambfhase> coder7of9: jQuery does not use .onclick
[11:31:37] <coder7of9> obviously they do
[11:31:54] <coder7of9> the dom uses onclick
[11:32:18] <Kambfhase> jQuery uses .addEventListener() when possible
[11:32:31] <coder7of9> i set the elem onclick handler using jquery. when i try to access it via plain javascript it return null.
[11:33:21] <coder7of9> why does it not show up when i access the event on the elem using plain js?
[11:33:38] <Kambfhase> as I said .addEventListener() does not set .onclick
[11:34:26] <coder7of9> i can set an event using addEventListener using plain javascript and i will see the click event when i call elem.onclick
[11:34:52] <Kambfhase> no, i doubt that
[11:35:04] <Kambfhase> .addEventListener() and .onclick() are two different APIs
[11:35:19] <ryanneufeld> coder7of9: try $(<selector>).click()
[11:35:25] <ryanneufeld> coder7of9: instead of elem.onclick
[11:35:30] <TelFiRE> Well it seems to have basically worked. I sure hope my methods aren't insanely low-performance and hacky :(
[11:36:01] <coder7of9> yes thanks.
[11:36:18] <TelFiRE> If it seems like my jquery is a bit... laggy for lack of a better word... like the frame per second seems a bit choppy... what can I do about it
[11:36:41] <TelFiRE> And I'm on a computer that is quite modern and shouldn't have any js hiccups. and have seen lots of js do a lot more than what I'm trying to do without lagging
[11:42:05] <mwolff6> I've noticed a lot of threads on Stack Overflow on how to find out if an event is bound, but it all uses techniques that were deprecated with jQuery 1.8. Is there currently a canonical or otherwise blessed way to find out if, say, an element has had .click set on it?

[12:12:58] <dualcore> why doesn't border-anything work with .css({}) ?  http://jsfiddle.net/kFeXn/
[12:13:59] <NoiseEee> dualcore: perhaps you mean $('div') instead of $(div)
[12:14:37] <NoiseEee> also, borderTop not border-top
[12:15:25] <dualcore> the div part was a typo but borderTop works thank you NoiseEee http://jsfiddle.net/kFeXn/2/
[12:17:42] <TelFiRE> dualcore: css that is hyphenated has different syntax in jQuery
[12:18:02] <NoiseEee> well different syntax in javascript
[12:18:03] <TelFiRE> marginLeft for example also
[12:18:26] <NoiseEee> you can use border-top on a single property, ie:  $(something).css('border-top','5px solid blue') will work iirc
[12:18:36] <NoiseEee> but if you're wrapping css rules in an object, gotta go natural JS
[12:18:38] <NoiseEee> iirc
[12:19:01] <TelFiRE> hmm idk but borderTop works in both cases so I just do that heh
[12:23:44] <TelFiRE> Is there some sort of form field validation in jQuery? I just want the ability to check if the field is filled and in the right format, and then do stuff based on whether it is or isn't. I don't want a plugin that tries to validate my whole form.
[12:25:38] <frewsxcv> Potentially stupid question: If I have my Javascript block right before </body>, why should I use $(document).ready if the elements are already loaded
[12:26:13] <TelFiRE> frewsxcv: just because the markup is loaded, a lot of stuff on the page still may not be
[12:26:24] <frewsxcv> Like?
[12:26:27] <TelFiRE> like images
[12:26:29] <TelFiRE> and css
[12:26:31] <TelFiRE> and anything
[12:26:54] <TelFiRE> in general, it will probably work, but it's just a best practice to make sure everything's loaded and you don't get glitchiness if for some reason it's not
[12:27:33] <frewsxcv> So CSS, images are both loaded asyncronously? Anything else?
[12:29:16] <TelFiRE> frewsxcv: well it loads the whole markup before it actually starts to load ANY of the resources on the page.
[12:29:35] <TelFiRE> images, and css are just two examples. Any resource, whatsoever, will still not be loaded just because the markup is
[12:31:42] <frewsxcv> cool, thanks TelFiRE
[12:51:43] <jwmann> Anybody here used the ScrollTo library before?
[12:52:07] <Zzaichik> yarp, a while ago
[12:54:01] <jwmann> I have resizing background images based on window.size and when I resisze the position of the slide goes off it's rails. I'm trying to make it so that when it resizes it will scroll to the last slide it was on.
[12:54:15] <jwmann> last slide being dertimined by the hash
[12:56:41] <adavia> hey guys im using a form dialog from twitter bootstrap.. im trying to find out why i cannot close the modal window with the x button http://jsfiddle.net/Bj8Cg/1/
[12:57:10] <adavia> have the problem when using ajax
[12:57:51] <Zzaichik> So you're just trying to set the position of the slider relative to the slide
[13:00:25] <lkzone> op: 2 is same thing op = 2 ?
[13:01:23] <lkzone> the x : 2 is same thing of x = 2 ?
[13:05:35] <NoiseEee> uh no lkzone
[13:14:43] <lkzone> NoiseEee: for what is the operator  :  ?
[13:15:24] <jwmann> Anybody use serialScroll library before?
[13:15:55] <jwmann> I'm trying to get the prev/next button to put the hash in the URL that the element it's scrolling to.
[13:17:21] <lkzone> for what is the operator  :  in jquery ?
[13:18:18] <systemfault> lkzone: Example?
[13:19:35] <lkzone> 			$('#slides').slides({ preload:true,
[13:19:41] <lkzone> for example this
[13:20:03] <lkzone> systemfault: k
[13:20:09] <systemfault> It's the equivalent of a = within an object literal.
[13:20:25] <systemfault> Perhaps you need to learn a little bit of JS before attempting jQuery
[13:20:30] <systemfault> (Just the basics)
[13:21:08] <lkzone> systemfault: ok, thanks
[13:26:39] <mdel> hey all - quick question
[13:26:47] <mdel> does moderizr have a jQuery version requirement
[13:27:20] <TelFiRE> eh... I'm pretty sure it doesn't use jquery at all
[13:28:26] <mdel> TelFiRE: you are correct, it seems... brain lapse on a friday
[13:28:27] <mdel> thanks'
[13:29:04] <systemfault> mdel: Not sure how the two are related.
[13:30:00] <mdel> systemfault: see above, that has been note
[13:30:00] <mdel> d
[13:30:02] <jerware> moin. How can I make a toggle button look "pressed" (for upon page first rendering).
[13:30:27] <systemfault> mdel: Ah ok
[13:30:48] <mdel> :) thanks though, I should stop working and sleep
[13:32:03] <jwmann> I neeeed da heeellpzz
[13:32:06] <jwmann> T____T
[13:33:14] <jerware> I suppose just click it.
[13:35:26] <jwmann> I'm using this library: http://flesler.blogspot.ca/2008/02/jqueryserialscroll.html and I'm trying to have the functionality where when you click next or pref buttons it will put the #hash of the element it's moving to in the URL. Can somebody take a look? I'm positive this lib can do it.

[14:11:45] <bbt> hi, how do i rename the tab url links for jquery tabs http://jsfiddle.net/ept5s/2/
[14:13:23] <TelFiRE> what do you mean
[14:14:16] <awc737> is it possible to put an iframe in a container, and if the iframe gets longer and requires a scrollbar, extend my container's height?
[14:14:32] <awc737> and this is a cross-domain iframe
[14:15:34] <bbt> TelFiRE trying to change the url before the hastags
[14:15:46] <bbt> *hashtags
[14:15:59] <TelFiRE> So, just change it?
[14:16:04] <bbt> yes
[14:16:04] <TelFiRE> what's the problem
[14:16:56] <bbt> doesnt it have to be a hastag only to work with ui tabs?
[14:17:03] <bbt> the link itself?
[14:17:42] <TelFiRE> you want the link to take you to a URL?
[14:18:06] <bbt> yes, with the relevant hashtag
[14:18:34] <awc737> is it possible to put an iframe in a container, and if the iframe gets longer and requires a scrollbar, extend my container's height?
[14:18:35] <TelFiRE> You're not being very clear. I have no idea what you're talking about really
[14:18:48] <bbt> btw, adding the full url + tag loops within itself
[14:19:08] <TelFiRE> If you want to link to another page, why are you using jquery ui tabs?
[14:19:16] <TelFiRE> the point of them is... tabs... not linking to another page
[14:19:38] <TelFiRE> the whole point of tabs is to not leave the page
[14:20:01] <awc737> TelFiRE, are you referring to me?
[14:20:09] <awc737> not being clear
[14:20:19] <bbt> when i click on one of the tabs, it brings up a menu, if i click on one of those menu links, the url changes for the tab hashtag
[14:20:23] <TelFiRE> no sorry awc737 I was talking to bbt
[14:20:53] <bbt> trying to keep the hashtag url+#tag static
[14:20:58] <TelFiRE> awc737: I understand your question quite clearly, sadly I don't know the answer :/
[14:21:06] <awc737> ok no prob
[14:31:42] <jonathancutrell> I've got a fairly straightforward optimization question
[14:32:02] <jonathancutrell> which is faster: $(".someclass, .anotherclass").addClass("foo");
[14:32:03] <jonathancutrell> or
[14:32:20] <jonathancutrell> $(".someclass").addClass("foo"); $(".anotherclass").addClass("foo");
[14:32:26] <jonathancutrell> I'm assuming the first,
[14:32:29] <Zzaichik> first one.
[14:32:41] <jonathancutrell> but I've seen the second used on major production sites in mass.
[14:32:51] <jonathancutrell> (Not in Massachusetts - in mass quantity)
[14:33:02] <Zzaichik> lol
[14:33:13] <jonathancutrell> I figured so, just wanted to make sure.
[14:33:40] <Zzaichik> Well - the speed difference isn't going to be signiticant.
[14:33:56] <Zzaichik> significant*
[14:34:03] <bigtunacan> I'm have a synchronicity issue
[14:34:36] <bigtunacan> I have elements across many pages that will all fire different change events
[14:34:59] <bigtunacan> Then I have to add and remove duplicates of those events.
[14:35:29] <Jon47> it sounds to me like you have an architecture issue
[14:36:00] <bigtunacan> To further complicate this the change event will block the element that is changing while it makes sure the data is saved.
[14:36:31] <bigtunacan> When an add button is clicked the click event is fired before the change event has completed
[14:36:49] <bigtunacan> So I end up sometimes with a duplicate element that is locked from editing
[14:39:18] * PoulADyson slaps PoulADyson around a bit with a large trout
[14:39:21] * PoulADyson slaps PoulADyson around a bit with a large trout
[14:39:40] <Zzaichik> with a big tuna
[14:40:37] <bigtunacan> @Jon47; we are building on top an existing framework that uses jQuery change events extensively; not much I can do about that part...
[14:41:33] <bigtunacan> Is there a way to look up what events are running?
[14:41:40] <bigtunacan> And only fire then?
[14:42:00] <Jon47> an event driven interface shouldn't be a problem, that's the browser's bread and butter
[14:42:26] <Jon47> but if you find yourself iterating through an element's existing event handlers, i think that's a sign that you're on the wrong path
[14:43:41] <bigtunacan> Well the core of my issue here is that I need to clone these various different elements and they may or may not be locked at the time they are cloned depending on where the element is in it's change event
[14:46:01] <dyret> I need a function opposite to jQuery.param
[14:46:22] <dyret> need to parse a querystring into a json object
[14:46:39] <dyret> doesn't jquery have anything like this implemented?
[14:49:39] <johnkpaul> dyret: no, it doesn't but https://gist.github.com/956897
[14:50:37] <devslash> is $('body') supposed toreturn a reference to the body tag ? im putting that into the console and it says that $('body') is null
[14:53:01] <Zzaichik> let's see your console.log() that's returning null.
[14:54:26] <devslash> is anyone here ?
[14:54:46] <johnkpaul> devslash: are you sure jquery is loaded?
[14:54:54] <devslash> yea
[14:54:55] <johnkpaul> use jQuery instead of $
[14:55:00] <johnkpaul> and see if it's still null
[14:55:06] <devslash> $('body') and $('head') return null
[14:55:12] <devslash> how so
[14:55:19] <johnkpaul> jQuery('body')
[14:55:38] <devslash> not defined
[14:55:53] <devslash> but my other jquery code works fine
[14:56:24] <johnkpaul> window.jQuery is undefined?
[14:56:39] <devslash> yes
[14:57:02] <devslash> im uing greasemonkey.. not sure if thats relevant
[14:57:04] <johnkpaul> then something is wrong devslash, I don't know how your other jquery code would work fine
[14:57:05] <johnkpaul> ah
[14:57:07] <johnkpaul> it is relevant
[14:57:20] <devslash> but i put jquery min into the top of my GM script
[14:57:21] <johnkpaul> greasemonkey doesn't have access to the same js environment as the page
[14:58:19] <devslash> so what can i do
[14:58:52] <johnkpaul> devslash: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2303147/injecting-js-functions-into-the-page-from-a-greasemonkey-script-on-chrome
[14:59:15] <devslash> thanks
[15:02:55] <radiantstatic> This might seem outlandish, but can anyone see a way of having a splash page that pulls up to reveal any number of page from my website. How would I go about loading a specific page beneath properly? This may not necessarily be the proper channel but I figured I'd ask.
[15:04:26] <radiantstatic> Similar to something like this - http://www.torontoimplant.com/index.html - except instead of a circle, its a series of options...
[15:12:22] <radiantstatic> Any ideas?
[15:18:48] <TelFiRE> How can I add validation to this so that it checks before going to the next page that fields were filled in? I understand the basics of validating a normal form, but not sure how it would apply here to do it per-page http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jLGeb
[15:22:21] <shoky> TelFiRE: i see 'Vertical Tabs' then i click next and see vertical tabs again. then i click previous and see 'select charity'
[15:22:35] <TelFiRE> yes it isn't working very well in the codepen but
[15:22:51] <TelFiRE> it works on live. not sure what the deal is but the idea is there
[15:23:45] <shoky> so.. are you asking about using a plugin? or how to roll your own validation
[15:24:25] <TelFiRE> if there's a plugin that will work well I'm down, but I can't find much info about just doing your own
[15:24:43] <shoky> which part is troubling you
[15:25:15] <TelFiRE> Well, most solutions seem to rely on adding an element to the html markup
[15:25:24] <TelFiRE> I don't have control over the markup, so that's my first roadblock
[15:27:29] <shoky> you could make some validation object instead, e.g.   var validations = { '#nameField': 'required', '#phonefield': 'required phone', ... }
[15:27:39] <shoky> where the keys are selectors for the actual elements
[15:30:36] <shoky> point is, anything you can say with markup, you can also say with js data
[15:31:51] <shoky> assuming you know what elements to select ;p
[16:05:09] <KWhat_Work> Did $.Widget.prototype._setOption.call(this, key, value); get updated to something a little nicer in 1.9?
[16:07:31] <KWhat_Work> nvr mind i found the wiki doc:  this._super( "_setOption", key, value );
[16:08:33] <kvnn> I'm having an issue where contentType in $.ajax on iOS is empty even when I assign it a value. Any ideas?
[16:11:51] <javalover> hi>
[16:25:28] <chare> If I have a logical graph of span's where the relationship between span's are strings how would I make this work in html so its possible to navigate it similar to how selectors in jquery work
[16:28:29] <shoky> the relationships are strings?
[16:29:42] <chare> what ever you want
[16:29:45] <chare> they are edges
[16:30:14] <chare> just how would you make a graph "DOM" work, we know how to deal with DOM in jquery
[16:31:18] <tw2113> okey-dokey shoky
[16:32:31] <LessSeen> svg
[16:32:53] <shoky> chare:  any DOM tree is .. a tree, that is, a graph
[16:33:11] <chare> thats why i'm trying to create the effect of a graph
[16:33:18] <shoky> what effect..
[16:33:27] <chare> I need a graph
[16:33:35] <shoky> what do you mean by graph?
[16:33:42] <chare> a graph is a graph
[16:34:01] <tw2113> there are like 50?million graphs
[16:34:11] <shoky> ok:  <div><p>hi</p></div>
[16:34:18] <shoky> there, a graph
[16:34:19] <chare> what definition of graph are you using tw2113
[16:34:21] <tw2113> and that's just in the craft graph section
[16:34:32] <shoky> there's a very specific definition of a graph
[16:34:36] <tw2113> oops, there i go mixing up craft brews and graphs
[16:34:57] <chare> and how do you add vertices and edges to your graph shoky
[16:35:01] <tw2113> bar graph? scatterplot graph?
[16:35:08] <chare> NODE-VERTEX
[16:35:19] <shoky> chare:  each element/node is a vertex
[16:35:29] <chare> and the edges?
[16:35:56] <shoky> the parent/child relationship
[16:35:58] <tw2113> this convo may be too math-y for me
[16:36:08] <shoky> tho that doesnt cover sibling ordering
[16:37:26] <chare> parent/child relationship restricts yourself to a tree,
[16:37:29] <chare> doesn't allow cycles
[16:38:24] <shoky> that is true
[16:38:35] <shoky> my example was a DOM tree, after all
[16:39:03] <LessSeen> http://d3js.org/
[16:39:10] * LessSeen hides ._.
[16:39:40] * tw2113 renames LessSeen to lastSeen
[16:39:50] <chare> so shoky you admitting defeat
[16:39:52] <shoky> chare: could you give a bit more specific example of what it is you want..
[16:39:56] <chare> you admitting you not an expert
[16:40:02] <shoky> chare: im admitting i dont understand what you want ;>
[16:40:06] <chare> A GRAPH
[16:40:12] <chare> HOW HARD IS A GRAPH TO UNDERSTAND
[16:40:15] <shoky> where?
[16:40:28] <chare> DOESN'T MATTER
[16:40:31] <shoky> and why are you yelling?
[16:40:40] * lastSeen shares popcorn with tw2113
[16:40:44] <shoky> at everybody
[16:40:44] <tw2113> mmm
[16:41:11] <shoky> and i'm by no means an expert on .. graphs
[16:41:22] <chare> god you are all dumb
[16:41:29] <lastSeen> lol
[16:41:35] <shoky> this was fun
[16:42:12] * lastSeen breaks out the marshmallows
[16:42:28] <lastSeen> we should be able to roast some :D
[16:42:44] <kvnn> I'm having an issue where an ajax request in ipad safari always shows Content-Type as blank. Any ideas?
[16:43:07] <rgr> using a certain plugin I am in a callback but dont have the event object. So how cam I call stopPropagation? Can I query current event?
[16:43:12] <tw2113> chare, yes, we realize you want a graph
[16:43:20] <tw2113> populated with what info?
[16:43:27] <tw2113> edges based on what data?
[16:43:28] <rgr> or is it a member of the $(this).
[16:43:54] <lastSeen> there inst flame..
[16:44:39] <chare> CHESS
[16:44:51] <lastSeen> chess graph oh that
[16:45:29] <tw2113> saying "chess board" would have been much easier
[16:45:53] <lastSeen> heh if he does mean that
[16:45:57] <lastSeen> instead of the moves
[16:46:12] <chare> GOD DAMN IT JUST GIVE AN ANSWER
[16:46:15] <lastSeen> the moves are really more of a t-chart
[16:46:27] <lastSeen> lol
[16:46:52] <tw2113> 42
[16:46:58] <tw2113> there, happy? problem solved
[16:46:59] <tw2113> next!
[16:47:01] <lastSeen> lmfao
[16:48:14] <chare> YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING STUPID
[16:48:16] <tlkr> chare, jQuery isn't really designed for web technology based graph generation so this probably isnt the right place to look. Hopefully this link should help: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=web+based+graph+generation
[16:48:24] <tw2113> i can give you all the half-assed answers you want, however, i choose to ask questions so i better understand what it is you actually want, so that i can put together an actual educated answer
[16:48:37] <chare> I SAID CHESS WHAT MORE IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
[16:49:06] <tlkr> chare, mate, you are in the wrong place for help with 'chess graphs'
[16:50:10] <tw2113> ima give up because i've never heard of a chess graph
[16:50:25] <tlkr> Neither have I ^^
[16:50:55] <chare> WTF THE POSITIONS ARE THE VERTICES OF THE GRAPH, THE EDGES ARE THE ALLOWABLE MOVES IN THE POSITION
[16:51:01] <chare> HOW DUMB ARE YOU?
[16:51:13] <tw2113> very dumb according to 1 person in the room
[16:51:44] <tw2113> anyone willing to back that person up with that assertion?
[16:52:39] <tlkr> Ignorarama.
[16:53:06] <chare> so you guys admittinrg you are clueless?
[16:53:08] <tw2113> i'll claim tlkr as half agreeing
[16:53:20] <tw2113> i still have no idea what this graph of yours will be populated with
[16:53:36] <tw2113> the souls of our unborn children?
[16:54:01] <chare> WTF I JUST SAID
[16:54:07] <chare> THE POSITIONS ARE THE VERTICES OF THE GRAPH, THE EDGES ARE THE ALLOWABLE MOVES IN THE POSITION
[16:54:20] <tw2113> a graph of chess moves?
[16:54:35] <chare> OMG WE ARE DEALING WITH A MORON WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE RULES OF CHESS
[16:54:39] <tw2113> calm your caps lock
[16:55:03] <tlkr> you have to be a troll :D
[16:55:09] <tw2113> yes, i'm a motherfucking moron because i don't play chess very much
[16:55:27] <razzi> what's with the efnet talk today here?
[16:56:06] <tw2113> now, to figure out how to plot this graph
[16:56:19] <tlkr> guys, I heard if you try to plot a chess graph a puppy dies
[16:56:52] <shoky> chare i understand game trees
[16:57:09] <chare> SO GIVE ME A SOLUTION
[16:57:27] <shoky> can you stop yelling though?
[16:58:05] <tlkr> chare you need to plot the edges of the vertices using the chess algorithm so use $('.graph').chess('graph', true);
[17:00:08] <tw2113> time for me to head home
[17:01:23] <JFranks> Damn..  I went through all the trouble of converting my <input type="checkbox"> items into iphone style checkboxes.. If the input loads with "true" and you don't touch it, the form passes "on" as the value.. if you toggle the checkbox it removes it from the form element entirely!
[17:01:47] <shoky> BYE TW2113
[17:01:57] <shoky> o too late
[17:06:47] <HarryPitfall> JFranks, just hide the input, and handle a element 'outside' it, changing checkbox value....
[17:11:50] <JFranks> HarryPits: Yeah I could probably find/fix it .. just so glum that I did all those inputs and fiddled with the CSS.. and now I either have to fix the plugin or undo all the input changes.. :p
[17:16:46] <JFranks> Heck from what I can see the demo/examples don't submit a form, so the devs actually never tried it?! https://github.com/tdreyno/iphone-style-checkboxes/blob/master/jquery-demo.html
[17:17:00] <JFranks> Time to go back.. ;p
[17:19:20] <JFranks> Hmmm actually.. http://jsfiddle.net/tdreyno/jye3g/  .. is a working fiddle.. if I could get a page WAN accessible that just does a <?php var_dump($_REQUEST);?> .. that would clear it up.. !
[17:29:38] <JFranks> YUP! The JSFiddle example has the same damn issue.. if you name all the checkboxes (required for post), only the checkboxes that default 'on' will 'post' in the form.. any you change will be 'missing' regardless of the state.
[17:30:33] <platzhirsch> For a web application built only on JS: Is it recommended to use a JS template engine for constructing html content instead of using DOM manipulation?
[17:30:51] <HarryPitfall> Use a template engine
[17:31:13] <amh345> evening. im not understanding why i need to have a second .click event to submit this form.  http://jsfiddle.net/bVu4k/
[17:31:25] <HarryPitfall> Currently, my way to deal is "server side" templates...
[17:31:34] <HarryPitfall> fragments of html using ajax
[17:31:47] <amh345> i was have thought that the first .click and the sumbit function would take care of everything
[17:31:57] <platzhirsch> yeah normally I am doing that too, I just build a very small demo with html and js only
[17:32:19] <platzhirsch> any to recommend? I have only found Handlebars.js and mustache so far
[17:32:37] <HarryPitfall> directy dom manipulation looks cool, but is a pain to maintain
[17:33:12] <JFranks> amh345: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/bVu4k/1/
[17:33:12] <HarryPitfall> I recommend the one that you feel better to use
[17:33:24] <HarryPitfall> the one that you can handle easily
[17:34:01] <amh345> JFranks: i dont think i asked my question properly.
[17:34:41] <amh345> what i mean to ask, in my example why is     $('#form_image').click(function(e) {$('#submit_order').submit();});  required if i already have a sumbit wrapped in the other .click?
[17:38:40] <amh345> or even more specific.  why doesnt this work > http://jsfiddle.net/bVu4k/2/
[17:39:47] <JFranks> amh345: given that the first instance has a return false; the second instance and the default action shouldn't fire.. So if it seems erroneous you are getting good vibes. ;)
[17:40:59] <amh345> i posted up another example where the second instance is removed altogether.
[17:41:06] <shoky> hey amh345
[17:41:08] <amh345> maybe im crazy and they both need to be there
[17:41:12] <amh345> hey shoky1
[17:41:34] <shoky> you're using two totally different .submit functions
[17:41:38] <JFranks> amh345: Your second example suffers the same problem.. if you wanted the default submit action to fire you can't have the last line return false;  .. ;)
[17:41:58] <shoky> the first one registers an event handler,  the second one triggers the event
[17:42:21] <JFranks> ++
[17:42:49] <JFranks> I must go do laundry now.. Have a good weekend people!
[17:43:12] <shoky> what makes them different is that the first receives a callback as argument, and the second has no arguments
[17:43:27] <amh345> so then it makes sense that they're both needed to perform this
[17:43:28] <shoky> i mean, that's how jquery knows which one you mean
[17:43:46] <shoky> well, actually in your case they're not
[17:43:53] <shoky> i mean, it's one way that works, sure
[17:44:04] <shoky> but you don't need an extra event in the way
[17:44:16] <shoky> you don't want to actually submit any form
[17:44:33] <shoky> well, unless the example is incomplete
[17:44:46] <amh345> yeah, the sample is stripped.
[17:44:55] <shoky> anyway you get why they're both needed
[17:44:57] <amh345> i need to send a form to the server, then trigger some js for a modal
[17:45:30] <shoky> are there other things that you want to also trigger the submit?
[17:45:39] <shoky> or just clicking on this div
[17:45:58] <shoky> by other things i mean like clicking enter or clicking another submit button
[17:46:05] <shoky> normal form-submits
[17:46:10] <amh345> it's just an image submit button.   or sometimes a actual submit button, depending on a toggle
[17:46:40] <shoky> oks anyway the way you have it is good & safe
[17:46:55] <amh345> ok, thanks.
[17:47:45] <shoky> oh sorry.
[17:47:50] <shoky> its not good ;)
[17:48:44] <shoky> amh345: its not good because you dont want to add an event handler each time its clicked
[17:48:57] <amh345> oh. heh
[17:49:17] <shoky> should be: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bVu4k/3/
[17:50:34] <amh345> oh man. i was way off.
[17:50:42] <amh345> thanks for sorting that out
[17:50:53] <shoky> np
[18:04:27] <tw2113> shoky, how was the graph topic solved?
[18:08:02] <chare> how do I iterate over the children of an element
[18:12:09] <tw2113> ?each
[18:12:10] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[18:40:49] <HarryPitfall> Time to relearn jQuery.ui
[18:40:55] <HarryPitfall> two new widgets...
[18:41:17] <HarryPitfall> that menu widget can be used to make a context-menu easily?
[18:44:21] <chare> JQUERY SUCKS SHIT
[18:45:21] <HarryPitfall> $(and sucks with style)
[18:45:30] <HarryPitfall> lol
[18:55:13] <tw2113> jquery can do a lot of awesome things, it can't do everything
[19:32:22] <HAPPYFUNBRO> hey
[19:32:33] <HAPPYFUNBRO> will this include jquery? <script type="text/javascript">
[19:32:53] <HAPPYFUNBRO> rather
[19:33:18] <chare> jquery is so fucking bloated
[19:33:19] <HAPPYFUNBRO> what do I need to do in order to add jquery code into an html doc?
[19:33:29] <chare> jquery is so bloated it makes my webpage take forever to load
[19:33:45] <tw2113> is there anything you like chare ?
[19:33:58] <chare> so you agree with me that jquery is bloated?
[19:34:15] <tw2113> did i say "i agree" ?
[19:34:19] <tw2113> i asked if there was anything you liked
[19:34:26] <chare> so you disagree? then tell me why
[19:34:39] <tw2113> i haven't given an opinion
[19:34:54] <tw2113> because i can't say i've said "i disagree" either
[19:36:05] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[19:36:25] <HAPPYFUNBRO> so let's say I alrewady have the jquery lib loaded. How would I include jquery code inline in a HTML doc?
[19:37:49] <tw2113> <script>$(document).ready(function(){ //my jquery code here }); </script>
[19:38:22] <HAPPYFUNBRO> OK!
[19:39:19] <tw2113> script tags
[19:39:32] <tw2113> check documentation on stuff you want to do, most of the time they provide examples
[19:39:38] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[19:39:39] <HAPPYFUNBRO> that works
[19:40:39] <HAPPYFUNBRO> now, as far as best prcatices are concerned, where should jquery code / scripts normally go on a webpage?
[20:04:14] <chare> how do i make a click event only trigger once and not cascade up to parents
[20:07:08] <HarryPitfall> chare: your function receives one parameter, is a event handler
[20:07:20] <HarryPitfall> .click(function(e) { ... })
[20:07:26] <HarryPitfall> there is some methods to handle
[20:07:32] <HarryPitfall> e.preventDefault()
[20:07:49] <HarryPitfall> and other one that i don't remember now
[20:07:51] <HarryPitfall> :/
[20:07:55] <HarryPitfall> that one cancels the bubble
[20:08:04] <tw2113> stopPropegation?
[20:08:07] <chare> JSFIDDLE LINK TO EXAMPLE NOW
[20:08:28] <HarryPitfall> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[20:08:53] <HarryPitfall> tw2113: exactly: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/

[20:10:34] <HarryPitfall> $('cant jsfiddle because im drunk')
[20:11:00] <chare> $('tw2113).girlfriend().dumped().you() == true?

[20:11:20] <tw2113> yeah, i miss your mom
[20:11:24] <tw2113> *runs*
[20:13:18] <chare> emmj did your boyfrined dump you again?
[20:15:05] <ryanneufeld> chare: knock it off
[20:15:52] <EmmaJ> chare, you are a pest.
[20:18:54] <HarryPitfall> $('.pest').remove()
[20:19:17] <HarryPitfall> too much js / jquery for today
[20:19:19] <HarryPitfall> argh
[20:30:04] <shoky> tw2113 i asked him to stop yelling and he shut up for 2 hours
[20:30:14] <shoky> ^^ re your question
[20:30:40] <tw2113> heh
[20:34:49] <Brando753> Hey guys if I have a text form, and I only want the submit button to appear after something has been entered into each textbox what would be the event method to use?
[20:35:37] <shoky> either keyup or change, or a combination of those/others ;P
[20:35:45] <shoky> depending on the exact effect you want
[20:36:11] <shoky> text can be entered into textboxes in a variety of ways
[20:38:05] <shoky> by a combination i mean for example:  $('.textbox').on('keyup change input paste', function(e) { ... })
[20:43:02] <javalover> shoky?
[20:43:16] <raj> shoky!?
[20:43:24] <shoky> heyo hihi hehe
[20:43:29] <shoky> sup raj-o
[20:43:34] <shoky> & javalover
[20:43:34] <javalover> hey man
[20:43:39] <raj> lol
[20:43:39] <javalover> i want that endless scrolling
[20:43:58] <shoky> endless?? you suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure??
[20:44:04] <javalover> so like what's the command to check scrolll height?
[20:44:12] <javalover> i get scrollTOP() is where it is
[20:44:17] <javalover> but what about scroll height?
[20:44:26] <javalover> so I can activate when scroll top > scrollheight - 20
[20:44:36] <shoky> wat is scroll height
[20:44:42] <javalover> that's what i'm asking like
[20:44:54] <javalover> how do I check to see when scrollTOP is at the end of div being scrolled
[20:45:19] <shoky> you have the viewport, which can be <body> or a nested container <div> or smth
[20:45:31] <shoky> something whose overflow is not shown
[20:46:20] <shoky> then you have the content itself, which would be wrapped in an element with overflow:auto or overflow:scroll
[20:46:33] <javalover> yes i have that
[20:46:46] <javalover> but how do I check to see when the content has scrolled the height of itself
[20:46:47] <shoky> so the "viewport" element's height is the 'scrollheight'
[20:46:49] <Brando753> shoky: so Im brand new to jquery so I decided to try out a bunch of different things to get better at it here is a demo Im writing to show the login button when something has been entered into both the text box and pass box, however even though this currently doesnt work , I feel that if it where it would possibly only work in the order text then pass not vice versa
[20:46:53] <javalover> ohhhh
[20:46:54] <javalover> ok
[20:47:06] <javalover> I get that
[20:47:24] <shoky> if you currently dont have it set up like that, then you should
[20:47:29] <raj> nothing much homie, eating candy and watching matrix
[20:47:34] <javalover> no no it is
[20:47:36] <javalover> ty ty
[20:47:37] <raj> awesome american day
[20:47:39] <shoky> cool
[20:47:49] <shoky> lol raj, sweet

[21:06:02] <shoky> bit more readable: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TjuHf/1/
[21:15:39] <Brando753> shoky: thank you very much, this makes a lot more sense to me, Im going to try a few more and ask back if there is a problem
[22:11:19] <Lucky--> is there any particular reason that i see some libs start off with a ; ? is that just the coder trying to terminate anything that might be unterminated?
[22:18:47] <shoky> i think that's it ye
[22:20:01] <chare> what the hell why does this print out everything? http://jsfiddle.net/9kFyp/
[22:25:42] <tw2113> chare, it looks like the .first() is used on the selector, not it's children
[22:25:59] <tw2113> thus it's grabbing the div id="yes" and whatnot
[22:26:14] <tw2113> try $('#yes span')
[22:27:27] <chare> so use children().first()?
[22:30:33] <tw2113> looks like that would work
[22:38:58] <tw2113> chare, i help you, and you keep trying to insult me
[22:39:01] <tw2113> talk about gratitude
[23:13:39] <chare> How can i maintain the presentation that the first element is outside of the parenthesis even if the dom is manipulated to move the order of the elements: http://jsfiddle.net/m892d/
