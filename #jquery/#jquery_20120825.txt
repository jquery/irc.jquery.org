[08:55:15] <xdjuj__> [17:20]  <anandhegde> i tried $("div.punch-viewer-right").click() but that didnt work :(
[08:55:29] <xdjuj__> Because with this code, you're listening to a click event
[08:55:39] <xdjuj__> What you are looking for is to "trigger" a click
[08:55:52] <xdjuj__> So I think you should use the trigger function
[08:55:53] <anandhegde> xdjuj__ i tried that also
[08:55:59] <anandhegde> it didnt work
[08:56:17] <anandhegde> probably becuase the iframe points to another domain as said by RandalSchwartz
[08:56:30] <xdjuj__> It must work :)
[08:56:38] <xdjuj__> Ha ? Iframe ?
[08:56:38] <xdjuj__> :)
[08:56:53] <matteu1> LifeSF: pastebin the script, please

[09:04:19] <LifeSF> no
[09:06:07] <matteu1> LifeSF: without exploring further, I don't see anything you're doing wrong, it seems like it might be an issues with the plugin
[09:06:31] <matteu1> LifeSf: <div class="slideshow" class="taskbar">
[09:06:44] <matteu1> LifeSF:  needs to be <div class="slideshow taskbar">
[09:07:17] <matteu1> LifeSF: most browsers will only use the first class attribute you give it, combine them in a space delimited string

[09:25:08] <matteu1> LifeSF:  I'm seeing all kinds of problems with that document
[09:25:21] <matteu1> LifeSF:  There are multiple html declarations
[09:26:34] <HAPPYFUNBRO> when I try to print the objct to the console, I get This is the next player:[object Object] in the former function, whereas I get an actual DOM element in the latter (when I try to print)

[09:34:32] <helllen> but it moves when I click on the content too
[09:34:38] <helllen> how could I avoid it?
[09:48:55] <LifeSF> matteu1: what do you mean?
[09:50:43] <rgr> whats the best approach to converting something like a google embed snippet ( from something like a slideshow) into a jquery element structure? Even possible?
[09:52:12] <HAPPYFUNBRO> could someone explain to me why the former function is not retaining the "player" object value when called in the latter function? (nextPlayer is not being passed for some reason) http://pastebin.com/HXMBm2bt
[09:52:17] <HAPPYFUNBRO> when I try to print the objct to the console, I get This is the next player:[object Object] in the former function, whereas I get an actual DOM element in the latter (when I try to print)
[09:58:30] <matteu> HAPPYFUNBRO: so 'player' in the first function is global to the two functions, but passed as an argument to the second?
[09:58:51] <Psycho_pr> Hi.. Why is the result of: rc_js.jquery('#txtbox_End Date').val(); undefined yet the result of: document.getElementById('txtbox_End Date').value; the actual value of the text box, "123"?
[09:59:00] <matteu> HAPPYFUNBRO: nevermind, I see that it's passed as an argument in the first as well
[09:59:55] <Psycho_pr> Found it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/596314/jquery-ids-with-spaces
[10:01:10] <matteu> HAPPYFUNBRO: in the first function, you are instantiating the jQuery object around player on fiddle line 5, so you would have to do the same in the second function if they are both DOM references, which you do on line 15
[10:01:28] <matteu> HAPPYFUNBRO: I'm not sure I understand your issue, what exactly is failing?
[10:01:59] <HAPPYFUNBRO> matteu here is a bit of updated code + instructiosn for replicating the problem: http://pastebin.com/FxemW67n and go to this site and follow the directos to see the stack trace: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/

[10:03:17] <rgr> can I convert something like the html from google for a picsa embedded slideshow into a jquery structure easily enough?
[10:04:26] <HAPPYFUNBRO> wait what the bleeding fuck
[10:04:32] <HAPPYFUNBRO> if I remove that function, all is well
[10:11:17] <rgr> Im looking for a recommendation for a good book on the inner workings of jquery and how to implement ones own extensions.
[10:11:47] <igcewieling> I assume there is no issue with using something like this $('#root_id > #some_child_id') even though it seems redundant?
[10:12:57] <mischief> RandalSchwartz: one does not simply prevent me
[10:13:28] <rgr> its not redundant since #root_id might not be there in other uses of #some_child maybe
[10:16:34] <RandalSchwartz> igcewieling - IDs are unique
[10:16:44] <RandalSchwartz> so $('#some_child_id') is very fast
[10:17:09] <igcewieling> I ask only because an ID is supposed to uniquely identify an element on a page so #child_id is sufficient to access the element.   However in my case, the #child_id might NOT be part of #parent_id, in which case I do not want it to match.
[10:18:15] <RandalSchwartz> if the text is broken, why do you care if it fails? :)
[10:19:04] <igcewieling> also my actual selector will be something like $(parent + ' > ' + child) and child might be an <input name= or an id=
[10:19:32] <RandalSchwartz> $(parent).find(child)
[10:19:40] <RandalSchwartz> don't construct a string only to have it be parsed back again
[10:19:42] <rgr> can I programmatically (or in chrome console) query the attributes easily of a jquery node type? e.g what user writeable attribute for a new <a> node?
[10:20:19] <igcewieling> RandalSchwartz: why not?  performance reasons?
[10:20:35] <RandalSchwartz> no... just plain "don't be dumb" reasons
[10:20:55] <igcewieling> I assumed constructing the string would be faster than .find() because find has to iterate thru (part of) the DOM.
[10:21:12] <RandalSchwartz> what do you think it eventually calls anyway?
[10:21:22] <igcewieling> RandalSchwartz: as you can see I know just enough to be dangerous. 8-|
[10:21:28] <RandalSchwartz> I'm beginning to sense that
[10:22:22] * RandalSchwartz wanders off
[10:22:39] <igcewieling> RandalSchwartz: In any case, thanks for the info.  I'll use .find() since that is what you recommend.
[10:29:29] <danzik17> igcewieling: find and the string that you posted earlier have two different meanings.  you want "children" to get the equivalent of the selector you posted.

[11:46:30] <Clex> HAPPYFUNBRO: .html()
[11:47:47] <LordThumper> aas: With CSS div[rel] { display: none; }
[11:48:02] <HAPPYFUNBRO> Clex text actually
[11:48:03] <HAPPYFUNBRO> but thanks
[11:48:37] <aaas> LordThumper sorry I'm not familar what is the "[]"?
[11:48:59] <LordThumper> That selects all divs which have attribute "rel"
[11:49:07] <aaas> LordThumper ah ok
[11:49:07] <LordThumper> div[rel='abc']
[11:49:15] <LordThumper> That selects all divs with attribute rel = "abc"
[11:49:34] <aaas> LordThumper but this would still have problems with people who disable js?
[11:49:42] <LordThumper> No
[11:49:49] <LordThumper> That is a CSS rule
[11:49:55] <LordThumper> Not a jQuery selector
[11:49:56] <lahabana> hey i've got a question it's been a while that I'm thinking about it and that I search but I don't seem to find a way
[11:50:12] <aaas> LordThumper yes of course, i mean it will bel hidden and not option to open if people disable js?
[11:50:28] <LordThumper> Yeah exactly
[11:50:47] <lahabana> I'm doing a query plugin that enables to modify json data
[11:50:59] <LordThumper> Just think about who your audience will be
[11:51:21] <lahabana> each editable property is just a span
[11:51:47] <LindsayMac> I do not understand the arguement of people who disable JS. It almost never happens anymore and when it does its really old people or geeks worried about tracking...
[11:51:49] <LordThumper> Don't see any semi-decent site being built without JS
[11:51:59] <aaas> LordThumper yeah I'm probably thinking too hard,  just trying to learn all the proper programming principles as I'm new
[11:52:00] <LordThumper> Unless you a using those new CSS animation rules
[11:52:10] <clouder_> LordThumper, that doesn't work the way he wants though. he doesn't want to hide divs with rel attrs. he wants to hide divs with class names that come from rels on anchor attrs
[11:52:21] <lahabana> but the thing is that I'd like to modify my json object as soon as it's modify on my view
[11:52:33] <LordThumper> Well if he needs to do that, he definately need JS
[11:52:45] <lahabana> ps: I don't wanna use backbone or stuff like that
[11:53:00] <lahabana> I wanted to throw personalised event
[11:53:08] <aaas> I'm just trying to minimize information loss if someone thinks they're smart and disables js
[11:53:15] <aaas> as I'm going to have quite a few of these
[11:53:31] <LindsayMac> aaas:  what makes you think you are going to have a lot of browsers who disable js??
[11:53:34] <lahabana> with the path in my json object
[11:53:40] <LordThumper> You can create a <noscript></noscript> fallback if you want
[11:53:45] <lahabana> though now I'm stuck with that
[11:53:58] <lahabana> cause the solution would be eval()
[11:54:04] <tw2113> i still think anyone with js disabled in 2012 is living a sad online life
[11:54:05] <aaas> LindsayMac oh im sure it will be very very few, but tyring to capture them anyways
[11:54:09] <lahabana> but eval is evil
[11:54:16] <tw2113> and the ones that insist on it, are knowing enough to know they have it off
[11:54:40] <lahabana> anybody?
[11:55:03] <LindsayMac> aaas:  like i said.. the ones who purposely turn it off are the same ones smart enough to turn it on when they need it
[11:55:31] <aaas> LindsayMac or just give up and say 'this site is stupid' ;)
[11:55:45] <LindsayMac> aaas:  its not something most developers need to worry about at this point.. unless you also are worried about the .005% of humans using IE6
[11:56:11] <LindsayMac> aaas:  you're completely missing the point.. not to mention you can not build a website that caters to EVERY SINGLE PERSON
[11:56:55] <aaas> LindsayMac of course not, but between the choice that gets most and the one that gets most + 0.005, if it means no real drawbacks then I'd pick the later
[11:57:06] <LindsayMac> make a good . no GREAT interface for the majority.. they are the ones who count
[11:57:20] <aaas> yes definitely
[11:57:34] <LindsayMac> aaas:  it has already been explained to you that there are drawbacks/impossibilities.. so there you have your answer
[11:57:35] <sonotos> aaas: even most of the big players stopped to support ie6
[11:57:40] <etisfo> I can't get fancybox to work...can anyone help?
[11:57:50] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  need more info
[11:58:13] <etisfo> when I click the thumbnail, it goes to the link rather than opening fancybox
[11:58:17] <aaas> LindsayMac I don't see any drawbacks to the js solution, well it does take more code
[11:58:34] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  did you initialize yhe script?
[11:58:42] <LindsayMac> aaas: forget it.
[11:58:47] <aaas> LindsayMac ok
[11:59:18] <etisfo> LindsayMac, I've called jQuery, Fancybox, Mousewhell, and this: http://pca.ignisvillage.com/assets/js/forums.js
[11:59:39] <etisfo> for my image, I'm doing <a class="fancybox" href="{_file.U_DOWNLOAD_LINK}" data-fancybox-group="gallery">
[11:59:52] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  does your link that you want to trigger the fancybox have the id fanceh ?
[12:00:06] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  thats your issue.. you are calling an ID but using a class.
[12:00:07] <etisfo> It did, but I removed it
[12:00:14] <LindsayMac> change this: $("#fanceh").fancybox({
[12:00:19] <LindsayMac> to this: $(".fanceh").fancybox({
[12:00:25] <LindsayMac> Oh wait.. hold on
[12:00:30] <LindsayMac> i was skimming the code.
[12:00:39] <LindsayMac> nevermind!
[12:01:47] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  what does the output of your file download link look like? Is it a direct url to the file or something more?
[12:02:11] <etisfo> LindsayMac, http://pca.ignisvillage.com/forums/download/file.php?id=3&mode=view
[12:02:13] <etisfo> example
[12:02:56] <LindsayMac> well that output isn't exactly a url to a file.. that could be it. You should try and get the actual file path..
[12:03:12] <LindsayMac> although I could be wrong...
[12:03:22] <etisfo> LindsayMac, that link works for embedding using <img>
[12:03:44] <LindsayMac> yea it does.. Just wasn't sure if fancybox was able to understand it.
[12:04:08] <LindsayMac> personally.. i hated fancybox..
[12:04:34] <etisfo> LindsayMac, alternative that you recommend?
[12:04:37] <etisfo> (that works)
[12:04:55] <LindsayMac> I've been very happy with prettyphoto in the past.. is it just for images? or more?
[12:05:05] <etisfo> LindsayMac, just images
[12:05:14] <etisfo> Click thumb, brings up big
[12:05:17] <LindsayMac> will this be an iphone friendly site too?
[12:05:42] <LindsayMac> Theres something not right about your code.. did you try to just use the basic to start..
[12:06:03] <etisfo> LindsayMac, no mobile
[12:06:30] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  try JUST this code to initiate your FB https://gist.github.com/0ee59da0f524ada06ebf
[12:06:50] <LindsayMac> Or try a.fancybox inplace of just .fancybox
[12:07:33] <etisfo> LindsayMac, both don't work, still opens links.
[12:07:44] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  can we see a link to your site?
[12:08:00] <etisfo> LindsayMac, http://pca.ignisvillage.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1&p=5#p5
[12:08:04] <LindsayMac> btw, this is the one i use often http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/
[12:13:59] <etisfo> LindsayMac, I'm gonna give pP a try
[12:14:44] <LindsayMac> Go for it. I've never had an issue with it once. I tried FB not that long ago and hated everything about it.. AND it looks terrible on iphone..
[12:22:25] <etisfo> LindsayMac, still goes to link
[12:23:00] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  i am going to need to take a look at the actual site at this point. Did you check in the source to be sure the .js files are being called ? Did you look for errors?
[12:23:27] <etisfo> LindsayMac, they are being called and are loading. site: http://pca.ignisvillage.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1&p=5#p5
[12:25:32] <LindsayMac> etisfo: you got this error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'prettyPhoto'
[12:25:40] <LindsayMac> and this Uncaught ReferenceError: onload_functions is not defined
[12:26:32] <tw2113> oh [object Object], you be a cruel bitch to n00bs
[12:26:58] <lahabana> hey guys I've got a problem with Json (it's more of a question)
[12:27:05] <abjorn> http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/25/13478643-astronaut-neil-armstrong-first-man-to-walk-on-moon-dies-at-age-82
[12:27:06] <abjorn> :(
[12:27:17] <lahabana> can anybody help me?
[12:27:33] <etisfo> LindsayMac, still have them now? (probably the onload still)
[12:28:02] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  yea.. are you using firebug or chrome dev tools? You can see them yourself too
[12:28:11] <etisfo> LindsayMac, how?
[12:28:13] <etisfo> Chrome
[12:28:23] <etisfo> oh
[12:28:23] <Patabugen> lahabana Nobody can help you until you ask the question ;)
[12:28:32] <lahabana> Patabugen: true
[12:28:39] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  open web dev tools and click Console and you will see the errors
[12:28:51] <etisfo> LindsayMac, <script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function(){$("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").prettyPhoto();});</script>
[12:28:51] <lahabana> well I've got a json that contains data that can be really diffeent
[12:28:59] <etisfo> that's the error for pF
[12:29:20] <lahabana> and I'd like to have events to modify certain values of that json
[12:29:28] <lahabana> I know where
[12:29:42] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  thats not the error, its the line where the error occurs
[12:29:46] <lahabana> but I don't see how to access it without eval()
[12:30:00] <lahabana> Is it something I miss?
[12:31:06] <etisfo> LindsayMac, I followed the instructions... :/
[12:31:30] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  can you disable the theme switcher plugin you have to see if it's conflicting?
[12:31:38] <lahabana> at first I wanted to bind event to these but they are strings or stuffs like that...
[12:31:52] <etisfo> LindsayMac, theme switched plugin? I don't have one
[12:32:05] <LindsayMac> style switcher?
[12:32:14] <etisfo> Don't have one
[12:32:26] <Patabugen> lahabana var jsonObject = jQuery.parseJSON(jsonVar) I believe it is
[12:32:51] <etisfo> If you're talking about the styleswitcher.js, that's nothing to do with jQuery (LindsayMac)
[12:32:52] <lahabana> no no I think I'm not clear
[12:32:57] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  well that other error is caused by styleswitcher
[12:33:00] <Patabugen> Which may use eval() inside anyway, I don't know
[12:33:11] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  but the error itself could be messing stuff up/conflicting..
[12:33:14] <lahabana> I already have the json object
[12:33:27] <Patabugen> lahabana, perhaps make a jsfiddle.net
[12:33:34] <lahabana> hmm yes
[12:33:53] <etisfo> LindsayMac, it's gone but still prettyPhoto error
[12:33:59] <LindsayMac> ok.
[12:34:06] <LindsayMac> just like to check everything as you go
[12:34:29] <etisfo> :)
[12:34:53] <LindsayMac> basically it seems like prettyphoto is not getting called. I wonder if its an order thing.. putting the initialization at the end of your document
[12:35:07] <LindsayMac> p.s. i am not the BEST js bebugger...
[12:35:31] <etisfo> LindsayMac, “Then, initialize prettyPhoto. Put the following code before the closing tag of your body ()”
[12:35:34] <etisfo> Which I did
[12:36:07] <lahabana> Patabugen: http://jsfiddle.net/NWqSU/
[12:36:09] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  in the output, it is showing up right before the <body>
[12:36:17] <lahabana> look at finishEditing
[12:36:28] <lahabana> I'm trig erring the event
[12:36:36] <LindsayMac> etisfo: http://cl.ly/image/390T3x1P2O3m
[12:37:06] <etisfo> OH
[12:37:11] <etisfo> It said end of BODY
[12:37:12] <etisfo> lol
[12:37:19] <lahabana> that represents the path into the json e.g.: jshint.options.browser
[12:37:47] <lahabana> and what I want to do is to modify that.json.jshint.options.browser
[12:37:50] <lahabana> u see?
[12:37:58] <etisfo> LindsayMac, is that how it should work?
[12:38:28] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  its working now ;)
[12:38:48] <etisfo> LindsayMac, is that how it should work though?
[12:38:58] <LindsayMac> yes.. thats a lightbox.. thats the goal.
[12:39:40] <etisfo> LindsayMac, :)
[12:39:47] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  what else did you expect?
[12:40:02] <etisfo> The white at the left is part of it?
[12:40:22] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  what white at the left?
[12:40:24] <etisfo> LindsayMac, possible to remove the shading on the page?
[12:40:38] <LindsayMac> http://cl.ly/image/3g1e1t0M2K0w
[12:40:50] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  that is the purpose of a lightbox.. darken the page and display the image.
[12:41:10] <etisfo> LindsayMac, I know, but I just want the image like that, not darken the page
[12:41:31] <LindsayMac> meh.. why?
[12:41:34] <juboba> can anybody help me using a jquery ui dialog? i need to pass some data to the dialog
[12:41:36] <LindsayMac> DO you have a reason why?
[12:42:10] <etisfo> LindsayMac, on 1366x768 and 1920x1080 there is white near the left because of alignment on the page
[12:43:14] <LindsayMac> etisfo: your html tag appears to have some padding or margin to the left..
[12:43:39] <LindsayMac> on forums.css you have html{margin-left:17px} remove it
[12:43:41] <Patabugen> lahabana: Your jsfiddle should be a minimalist version of the problem
[12:43:51] <lahabana> Patabugen: ok
[12:43:53] <etisfo> LindsayMac, I *need* that
[12:43:53] <jcp_> anyone run into problems with jquery crashing android browser?
[12:44:04] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  why?
[12:44:13] <etisfo> LindsayMac, alignment fix
[12:44:24] <juboba> I got $('.the_button').click(function(){            $('.the_dialog').dialog('open');    });
[12:44:36] <etisfo> Also possible to edit social_tools outside of prettyphoto.js?
[12:44:46] <juboba> I wonder if I can do: $('.the_dialog').dialog('open', my_variable);
[12:45:03] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  read through the PF website.. there's details there
[12:45:16] <etisfo> LindsayMac, yep just found :)
[12:45:47] <juboba> anybody?
[12:55:28] <lahabana> Patabugen: http://jsfiddle.net/NWqSU/1/
[12:55:36] <lahabana> Patabugen: it should be clearer
[12:56:51] <lahabana> Patabugen: do you get the general idea?
[12:57:45] <Patabugen> lahabana: I don't think I do, a.b.c is a function?
[12:57:57] <lahabana> nop
[12:58:01] <lahabana> it's a string for eg
[12:58:07] <lahabana> or a boolean
[12:58:12] <lahabana> anything
[12:58:14] <etisfo> LindsayMac, how can I remove the darken
[12:58:33] <lahabana> do you know futon for couchDb?
[12:58:41] <lahabana> when u edit json
[12:58:43] <LindsayMac> etisfo:  isn't there a theme on the prettyphoto website that shows that?
[12:59:03] <lahabana> u've got that cool thing where u edit directly by clicking on the json
[12:59:07] <lahabana> that's what I'm doing
[12:59:13] <lahabana> If I make sens
[12:59:37] <lahabana> so I've got the json as a model in the back
[12:59:48] <etisfo> LindsayMac, doesn't look like it
[13:00:00] <lahabana> and every time the user modifies the json displayed on the screen
[13:00:07] <lahabana> the model has to be updated
[13:00:25] <lahabana> and I don't want to use stuffs like backbone etc ;)
[13:01:23] <Patabugen> lahabana: You're making a json editor essentially?
[13:01:32] <lahabana> yes in other words ;)
[13:01:39] <Patabugen> What's the trigger() for?
[13:01:41] <lahabana> but I edit just pieces
[13:01:47] <lahabana> to update the model
[13:02:15] <lahabana> "a.b.c.d" says ==> that.json.a.b.c.d has been updated
[13:02:42] <lahabana> and triggers the function to modify that.json.a.b.c.d
[13:02:51] <lahabana> and I don't know how to do that
[13:02:59] <lahabana> apart with an evel
[13:03:02] <lahabana> *eval
[13:04:07] <Patabugen> I don't entirely understand what you want to do
[13:04:38] <lahabana> well when a modification is done
[13:04:48] <lahabana> i don't update the whole json
[13:05:03] <lahabana> I just change what has been change
[13:05:20] <lahabana> is clearer that way?
[13:05:34] <Patabugen> I'm afraid not
[13:05:45] <lahabana> sorry I'm crap at explaining
[13:05:48] <Patabugen> You want to have a JSON string - specifically not an object - which is editable?
[13:06:24] <lahabana> no no the that.json is the object
[13:06:38] <defaultro> imagine this folks, an index.php that has multiple <script></script> loading different .js files. Does it mean that the next javascript file(say line 7) gets all the object that was loaded by the other javascript file(say line 5) on top of it?
[13:06:42] <lahabana> but the json is displayed in the brower
[13:06:46] <lahabana> *browser
[13:06:54] <shoky> hey. non-jq-related but: hoping to get help with a css-rotate transform issue on chrome. i want all the arrow imgs to have a pointer-cursor, and to trigger click events. but the 3d stuff causes it to not work on some parts of the arrows on the sides. also if i inspect-element at the point where it doesn't work, it selects the rotated img from behind. how do i fix this? thanks.  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QWNyT/4/
[13:07:15] <lahabana> and when a guy edits a piece of text for e.g. {a: c} ==> {a: d}
[13:07:40] <lahabana> well only that.json.a is changed
[13:07:54] <Patabugen> Neither of your jsfiddles have anything for me to do =( Try to make it so there's a button I can click, and you can tell me what's meant to happen and what happens instead
[13:08:27] <lahabana> ok
[13:22:47] <defaultro> does anyone know how to find out which js file provided a variable? It's because index.php is loading 37 javascript files. There is a variable called editor and I wouldl like to know which javascript it is from
[13:23:41] <HAPPYFUNBRO> how would I go about waiting for an event to occur? for example, if I click a button that changes a page, how would I tell my code to wait until the next page is loaded?
[13:25:27] <lahabana> Patabugen: http://jsfiddle.net/NWqSU/3/ something like that
[13:25:34] <lahabana> but it stills doesn't work
[13:25:48] <lahabana> u see the thing commented on the bind function
[13:25:58] <lahabana> it's something like that that I'd like to do
[13:26:58] <Patabugen> Ahh I see
[13:27:28] <lahabana> Patabugen: but really general
[13:27:34] <Patabugen> yeah
[13:27:37] <Patabugen> Gimme a mo to think
[13:27:43] <lahabana> ok thx
[13:28:11] <lahabana> (honestly the more the time goes the more I'm thinking I should have just done something with backbone ;) )
[13:30:20] <Patabugen> I don't know what backbone is
[13:31:07] <tw2113> http://backbonejs.org/
[13:32:13] <lahabana> Patabugen: it's really easy to make an MVC with that
[13:34:19] <Patabugen> lahabana: Does this help: http://jsfiddle.net/NWqSU/4/
[13:34:51] <Patabugen> It works because objects are passed by reference
[13:35:02] <Patabugen> Which is also why you can't go all the way to the property in the loop
[13:35:15] <Patabugen> It'll break, I think, if the json is not object all the way. You'd have to test it with arrays
[13:35:19] <Francis47> dows anyone know what APC version i should use with PHP/5.2.10-2 ?
[13:35:39] <Patabugen> Francis47: You'd want #php for that
[13:36:10] <Francis47> my apologies then
[13:36:21] <Patabugen> ##php even
[13:36:22] <shoky> tw2113 can u halp ;(
[13:36:44] <gnarf> anybody want to RT this and help me spread the word? https://twitter.com/gnarf37/status/239460860597252096
[13:37:03] <Patabugen> HAPPYFUNBRO: I've not looked at them in jQuery (only Dojo) but Promise might be what you're after
[13:37:12] <lahabana> Patabugen: indeed
[13:37:19] <lahabana> http://jsfiddle.net/NWqSU/4/
[13:37:26] <lahabana> http://jsfiddle.net/NWqSU/5/
[13:37:36] <lahabana> sorry (forgot to save)
[13:37:46] <lahabana> the two divs should be syncs
[13:38:10] <Patabugen> lahabana: Ahh sorry, should have tested that
[13:38:33] <lahabana> and that's my problem ;)
[13:39:08] <Patabugen> Why does it not pass by reference, can it be made to?
[13:40:31] <lahabana> sorry I don't understand the second part of ur sentence
[13:40:42] <Patabugen> Do you know what it means to pass by reference?

[13:42:22] <Patabugen> lahabana ^^ I think that comment in the middle is your problem
[13:42:45] <lahabana> ho ok thx
[13:42:55] <lahabana> yes I do know Patabugen
[13:43:20] <Patabugen> I think (think!) that because I've got the property in the array-style it's getting the value and not a reference
[13:43:33] <wingy> is there a way to find only one child of an element?
[13:43:56] <Patabugen> wingy, such as the first one with :first ?
[13:43:58] <wingy> so there would be no performance burden
[13:44:09] <johnkpaul> ?first @wingy
[13:44:13] <wingy> i have a <div? with a <a>
[13:44:20] <wingy> and i wanna get the a
[13:44:26] <Patabugen> I think $('div a:first') will do that
[13:44:31] <wingy> ok
[13:45:02] <Patabugen> Or if you know there's only one a $('div > a');
[13:45:15] <Patabugen> > means it'll only look for immediate children
[13:45:31] <Patabugen> whether $('div').children('a:first') is faster, slower, or identical I have no idea
[13:45:42] <wingy> Patabugen: okay thx
[13:46:05] <wingy> Patabugen: but doesn't 'div > a' mean find all <a> that is children of <div> ?
[13:46:06] <Patabugen> lahabana: If you figure it out, I'd be interested to know
[13:46:12] <lahabana> yes ok
[13:46:17] <lahabana> there must be a way
[13:46:29] <Patabugen> Yes, but "div > a:first" should get you only the first
[13:46:36] <wingy> ah yeah
[13:46:43] <Patabugen> It means if there is no a, it'll not bother with children of children
[13:46:51] <lahabana> it's even more annoying when I think it takes my 5secs to do it in C++ :(
[13:46:56] <Patabugen> and, presumably, not bother searching children of children before siblings. If it does that
[13:47:04] <gnarf> Patabugen: wingy: the :first selector is not as quick as .first()
[13:47:06] <wingy> Patabugen: i have the element reference so i have to use children : $(div).children()
[13:47:10] <Patabugen> haha lahabana I know what you mean, if it were PHP I'd know how :
[13:47:11] <Patabugen> :P
[13:47:23] <wingy> gnarf: i see .. but it is safer i guess
[13:47:27] <Patabugen> gnarf Thanks!
[13:47:28] <gnarf> wingy: if they can be grandchildren, you want .find()
[13:47:43] <wingy> gnarf: since if i put <span> as a sibling before <a> then first() wouldn't get the <a>
[13:47:49] <gnarf> $(elem).children("a").first()
[13:48:01] <wingy> ah
[13:48:03] <wingy> hm
[13:48:07] <Patabugen> gnarf, do you know whether there's a performance (or other) difference between $('#foo').children('a') and $('#foo a')?
[13:48:08] <wingy> are you sure?
[13:48:11] <gnarf> wingy: http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[13:48:23] <gnarf> wingy: http://api.jquery.com/first/
[13:48:23] <wingy> it is more performent .. since it seems to fetch ALL a and then filter the first one out
[13:48:33] <gnarf> wingy: thats what a:first does also
[13:48:41] <lahabana> http://jsfiddle.net/NWqSU/7/
[13:48:44] <gnarf> wingy: it just doesn't return until after the filter
[13:48:45] <lahabana> it seems to work...
[13:49:00] <lahabana> though I don't understand what changed Patabugen
[13:49:07] <Patabugen> .... oh dear... one of those
[13:49:09] <Patabugen> haha
[13:49:11] <Patabugen> number 5?
[13:49:15] <gnarf> and using :first since it isn't a CSS3 selector forces Sizzle to have to parse that selector manually rather than using querySelectorAll
[13:49:42] <Patabugen> gnarf: ahh that's interesting to know
[13:49:46] <Patabugen> makes sense...
[13:49:47] <wingy> gnarf: ok ill use first()
[13:50:08] <wingy> worked great
[13:52:02] <lahabana> Patabugen:  I'm sorry ur code was perfect
[13:52:11] <lahabana> My test was wrong...
[13:52:22] <lahabana> Thx a lot
[13:52:31] <Patabugen> Ahh awesome
[13:52:45] <Patabugen> Ahh you missed the .json ?
[13:52:55] <lahabana> â€¦. yes
[13:52:56] <lahabana> :(
[13:52:58] <Patabugen> haha
[13:53:01] <lahabana> sorry
[13:53:02] <Patabugen> At least it's working :)
[13:53:05] <lahabana> yes
[13:53:19] <lahabana> though I still have real issues to get that
[13:53:28] <lahabana> are all objects always passed by reference?
[13:53:40] <Patabugen> Yeah, I do believe so
[13:53:44] <lahabana> ok
[13:54:00] <Patabugen> I only briefly checked recently though
[13:54:09] <lahabana> ha Javascript I love and I hate at the same time ;)
[13:54:11] <etisfo> LindsayMac, thanks for your help earlier! Got it working how I want :)
[13:54:20] <gnarf> everything is "passed by reference"
[13:55:06] <gnarf> arrays, objects, functions, even numbers
[13:55:20] <LindsayMac> good stuff
[13:55:46] <gnarf> LindsayMac: turnin into a pro ;)
[13:56:02] <etisfo> LindsayMac, turned out I just needed to change #000 to #FFF for the white on left problem
[13:56:05] <gnarf> LindsayMac: next thing we know, you're gonna be writing pull requests for jQuery! :)
[13:57:02] <Patabugen> gnarf, should this not output 12 if everything is passed by reference?
[13:57:14] <gnarf> Patabugen: ?
[13:57:42] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  hahaha... yea.. unlikely!
[13:57:47] <LindsayMac> or unlikely soon
[13:57:52] <Patabugen> If it's passed by reference, should me setting the value within the function not change it outside?
[13:58:02] <Patabugen> Or have we different meanings for passed by reference?
[13:58:02] <gnarf> if it looks something like function test(a) { a=12; } var b=4; test(b);
[13:58:10] <Patabugen> ooh, or does it create a copy when you actually write to it?
[13:58:45] <gnarf> you are passing a reference to the number 4 into the function, but then when you assign 12 to a, you are replacing the reference to "4" with a reference to "12" for the variable "a" inside the function scope
[13:58:59] <gnarf> it doesn't change the value that was passed in, because you assigned it to a new reference
[13:59:01] <gnarf> however
[13:59:27] <gnarf> function test( a ) { a.push( "test" ); } var b=[]; test( b ); console.log( b );
[13:59:29] <Patabugen> Ah I see, so the val++ creates a new variable called var?
[13:59:33] <gnarf> that will result in [ "test" ]
[13:59:37] <Patabugen> YEah
[13:59:55] <Patabugen> Why does that count as val being passed by reference?
[14:00:23] <Patabugen> Or is it a technicality?
[14:01:02] <gnarf> Patabugen: because val++ is basically "val" then "val=val+1"
[14:01:07] <gnarf> which reassigns "val"
[14:01:38] <gnarf> think of a number as a unmutable object
[14:01:50] <gnarf> when you add another number, it returns a new "number"
[14:02:05] <gnarf> same with strings
[14:04:25] <gnarf> Patabugen: numbers and strings are a little strange when thinking of the "by reference" mentality
[14:04:36] <gnarf> but it definitely is not creating a copy of the object before passing it
[14:07:31] <gnarf> also - https://twitter.com/gnarf37/status/239142416802803712 could use some RT love too ;)
[14:08:20] <Patabugen> Ah I see, is there a way to make pass it in such a way that it edits the variable outside the scope?
[14:08:23] <Patabugen> Other than returning and reassigning
[14:09:36] <gnarf> Patabugen: pass it an object that contains properties
[14:09:46] <gnarf> you can edit those properties and changes are reflected outside
[14:09:48] <gnarf> i.e.
[14:09:52] <Patabugen> Fair enough
[14:10:21] <gnarf> var settings = {};  function test( sets ) { sets.test = true; } test(settings); settings;   <--- try that on console
[14:19:28] <Patabugen> Thanks gnarf :)
[14:20:23] <shoky> non-jq-related but: hoping to get help with a CSS-rotate transform issue on chrome (works fine in ff). all the arrows should have a pointer-cursor and trigger click events. but the 3d stuff behind causes it to not work on some parts of the arrows on the sides. how do i fix this? thanks.  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QWNyT/5/
[14:44:51] <gnarf> Patabugen: np
[14:45:55] <gnarf> hrm shoky - no clue on that one
[14:46:04] <gnarf> interesting tho
[14:52:30] <shoky> much more minimal now:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QWNyT/7/
[14:54:04] <shoky> less stuff, that is.
[14:56:30] <shoky> thanks for looking gnarfy
[14:58:35] <bung> anyone here do a lot of ajax stuff ever used something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3121838/reusable-js-ajax-pattern-jquery
[14:58:53] <bung> looks pretty good im surprised he didn't get any replies
[15:05:28] <Patabugen> bung: I have a similar thing
[15:07:02] <shoky> i also have a similiar thing to a bung
[15:07:14] <Patabugen> Though mine is more for uniform error handling than anything else
[15:07:21] <shoky> i shall go light it
[15:07:22] <Patabugen> It just has it's own defaultOptions which you can override
[15:09:26] <jqurious> Hi
[15:14:43] <jqurious> I got <a> inside <p>. Any quick wat to convert clicked <a> into normal text
[15:14:48] <Doxin> is it possible to do streaming json using jquery?
[15:14:49] <jqurious> ?
[15:15:56] <bung> Patabugen: anything you'd be willing to share here?
[15:16:05] <Patabugen> I have done =)
[15:16:20] <gnarf> bung: I would make it return the jqXHR
[15:16:30] <gnarf> so you can just .done( function( data ) ) {} etc
[15:16:41] <gnarf> minus the typo
[15:16:59] <bung> that
[15:17:00] <bung> my head
[15:17:58] <gnarf> bung: https://gist.github.com/4a4266dc9785b7e8660e
[15:18:35] <jqurious> I see that my problem looks like iversion of most popular problem of turning plain text int <a>s :D
[15:19:15] <bung> damn thats so beyond me lol
[15:19:19] <gnarf> bung: pasted again
[15:19:34] <Patabugen> jqurious I don't understand your problem, thought it sounds like you want .text() ?
[15:19:44] <gnarf> bung: Usage: Server.auth({ username: "bob", password: "bob" }).done(function( user ) { ... });
[15:20:32] <jqurious> I want to make things like <p> blahblah <a href="#">hehe</a></p> into <p>blahblah hehe</p>
[15:20:50] <gnarf> bung: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred
[15:20:59] <jqurious> turn into
[15:21:06] <gnarf> sorry
[15:21:06] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[15:21:17] * gnarf blames whoever didn't document jQuery.Deferred
[15:21:46] <gnarf> bung: deferreds and promises are essential in large scale async programming
[15:22:10] <bung> nods
[15:22:10] <Patabugen> jqurious: http://jsfiddle.net/RFuMv/
[15:22:34] <gnarf> bung: jQuery.ajax() returns a deferred
[15:22:42] <gnarf> or rather a promise
[15:22:49] <bung> Patabugen: isnt that missing a this
[15:23:05] <gnarf> a special type of promise called a jqXHR -- you can just attach callbacks to it
[15:23:10] <gnarf> as many as you want
[15:23:10] <Patabugen> in my jsfiddle for jqurious?
[15:23:19] <bung> yea something about that doesnt seem right
[15:23:28] <Patabugen> It's just a demonstration of text()
[15:23:39] <Patabugen> more a test to check I'm suggesting the right thing ;)
[15:23:40] <bung> $('p').each(this.html(this.text()));
[15:23:43] <bung> something or other
[15:24:05] <bung> gnarf: i guess i have a lot of reading to do
[15:24:13] <bung> thanks for the brain dump though
[15:24:16] <Patabugen> bung: That'd depend on what he wants to do with it I guess
[15:24:23] <gnarf> $('p').text(function() { return $(this).html(); });
[15:25:06] <gnarf> bung: ^^^ you can pass a function to almost every setter in jQuery
[15:25:48] <gnarf> $('p').html( function( index, currentValue ) { /* this === element */ } );
[15:26:25] <bung> interesting
[15:27:37] <gnarf> $('p').text(function( index, currentValue ) { return "!!!" + currentValue; });
[15:31:20] <ML74> need some adviceâ€¦ on the following image (http://grab.by/fDeu) i need the tables and seats for the respective table to change colour on hover. what'd be the best way to get this effect?
[15:36:41] <sunbeam> hi, i would like any image that is inserted into my page to have a portrait as background image.. any idea how I can do this best??
[15:38:13] <Patabugen> sunbeam, do you mean like a watermark?
[15:38:44] <sunbeam> no just like a background surrounding the img
[15:40:13] <Patabugen> You want one image overlaying another?
[15:40:29] <Patabugen> As in, on top so the inserted one covers the middle of the portrait?
[15:40:35] <Patabugen> What are you trying to do?
[15:40:41] <sunbeam> no
[15:40:43] <sunbeam> I have an image
[15:40:47] <sunbeam>  a picture of me
[15:40:54] <sunbeam> it should be INSIDE the portrait
[15:41:22] <sunbeam> but i guess thats not possibled without using an element surrounding the <img?>
[15:41:29] <Patabugen> I don't understand what you mean by portrait, if the image of you isn't the portrait
[15:41:43] <sunbeam> nvm
[16:03:26] <HAPPYFUNBRO> how would I use ajaxComplete() to perform actions after the ajax code (brought on by a click on a hyperlink) complete?
[16:08:56] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: We suggest against the use of those methods as they are global
[16:09:18] <gnarf> you can attach a callback to an ajax call using .done( callback )
[16:09:24] <gnarf> or even .always( callback )
[16:09:29] <gnarf> (1.6+)
[16:09:36] <gnarf> if you want it to happen on error too
[16:14:41] <HAPPYFUNBRO> well, I have a fairly complex problem, in that I have my program simulate a click on an ajax pager when an even occurs. Once that click occurs, more events need to happen. However, they need to happen after the pager has loaded its content on the page (the pager is part ofa different program on my system)
[16:15:51] <HAPPYFUNBRO> is there some way that I could monitor the DOM hierarchy for the new content
[16:15:52] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ?
[16:19:05] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: do you maintain the pager as well?
[16:19:35] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: best way to do that would be to add a method to the pager that will take a callback when it has finished
[16:19:43] <gnarf> rather than "simulating click" even
[16:23:28] <wroathe> hey all... I've got a <li> with a nested <ul> that I'm trying to animate. The nested ul is absolutely positioned inside of the list item using the position: relative; position: absolute trick. The only problem is that in ie8 it seems to fire mouseleave as soon as I leave the list item and start hovering over the nested <ul>
[16:23:38] <wroathe> I can post code if anyone is interested in helping...
[16:25:21] <wroathe> It's almost like it's not registering the fact that I'm still within the li
[16:25:26] <shoky> wroathe: everybody's interested
[16:27:21] <wroathe> Ok, HeI'll see if I can jsfiddle it
[16:32:27] <wroathe> http://jsfiddle.net/m7qmY/
[16:33:07] <wroathe> Sorry, some of the formatting is screwy... It's wordpress and I'm using sass for the CSS so I had to dump the converted CSS
[16:33:57] <wroathe> But in ie8 when you hover your mouse off of the list item the sub menu closes. The desired effect is that it should remain open until I leave either the list item or the nested list.
[16:34:15] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf I did not create the pager method
[16:34:36] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: :( -- what you want is much much harder
[16:34:52] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf in fact, I'm not sure how I would create the callback
[16:35:01] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf harder or impossible?
[16:35:39] <gnarf> you will probably have to use the global ajax events, which is kinda painful
[16:35:53] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[16:35:59] <HAPPYFUNBRO> so *how* would I go about doing that
[16:37:01] <HAPPYFUNBRO> this does not appear to work: http://pastebin.com/ksRtrM6Y
[16:37:16] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: what version of jQuery?
[16:37:34] <HAPPYFUNBRO> 1.6
[16:38:12] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: ajaxComplete is called for EVERY ajax, not just the "last" one
[16:38:38] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok, that's something I can manage
[16:38:48] <HAPPYFUNBRO> however, this doesn't appear to work at all right now
[16:40:15] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I had assumed that the pastebinned snippet of code would begin loading the other actions after the click finished + new content loaded
[16:40:20] <HAPPYFUNBRO> is that not the casE?
[16:40:41] <jqurious> Can jquerry convert from ifix notation to RPN?
[16:40:56] <jqurious> infix to reversed polish notation
[16:41:15] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf ?
[16:41:17] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: i'm tellin ya, its probably easier to modify the pager to do a .trigger( "pagechange" ) on something
[16:41:24] <gnarf> then you can listen to that
[16:41:33] <jqurious> or got to implement algo myself
[16:41:47] <HAPPYFUNBRO> how would I "listen" for that?
[16:42:22] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: .bind( "pagechange", callback )
[16:42:22] <dabear_> .bind("pagechange", function(){  })
[16:42:25] <gnarf> just like any other event
[16:42:58] <HAPPYFUNBRO> so I would set the pager to .trigger("pagechange") on complete
[16:43:33] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: find where in the code its done, and trigger pagechange on some element (like perhaps the container)
[16:43:47] <gnarf> then you can listen for the pagechange event on that element from the "outside"
[16:43:49] <HAPPYFUNBRO> hm. could you show me a really quick example?
[16:44:38] <gnarf> of how to modify a section of code i haven't ever seen?
[16:44:49] <HAPPYFUNBRO> on how to trigger and bind
[16:44:56] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/trigger
[16:47:30] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[16:47:37] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I think I've found the pager code
[16:47:43] <HAPPYFUNBRO> so let's see about this trigger
[16:49:09] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[16:49:18] <HAPPYFUNBRO> how would I monitor for the trigger?
[16:50:00] <dabear_> HAPPYFUNBRO: be more specific
[16:50:39] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[16:50:40] <NexHD> hi
[16:50:40] <HAPPYFUNBRO> yeah
[16:50:42] <HAPPYFUNBRO> found it
[16:50:51] <dabear_> .bind to listen for/monitor events, as was told to you
[16:51:07] <NexHD> i want to ask if this code is good? var stylesheet = $("button").data("file");
[16:51:09] <NexHD> ?
[16:53:21] <dabear_> NexHD: it is not bad, but would it give you what you want/expect
[16:53:23] <dabear_> ?
[16:54:08] <HAPPYFUNBRO> hm
[16:54:36] <HAPPYFUNBRO> what would I .bind("pagechange", function() {}) to?
[16:54:52] <NexHD> he give me undefined
[16:54:56] <NexHD> in console.log
[16:55:52] <HAPPYFUNBRO> actually
[16:56:10] <NexHD> normaly should be value of the button
[16:56:17] <NexHD> but give me undefined
[16:56:26] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I guess I'm not clear on what the .trigger should be added to
[16:56:51] <HAPPYFUNBRO> in the pager.js file I did $(this).trigger("pagechange");
[16:57:09] <HAPPYFUNBRO> and then I did $('.view').find('.pager-next a').click().bind("pagechange", function() { in my plyer
[16:57:21] <dabear_> NexHD: do you have a <button data-file="something"> ? or data attached to the button previously?
[16:57:25] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: what is ".view" ?
[16:57:35] <dabear_> if not, then undined is returned
[16:57:50] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: i would probably trigger it on whatever that is
[16:58:05] <gnarf> it seems like the "widget"
[16:58:15] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf it's the container DIV for the "next page" link
[16:58:33] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: what is $(this) when you triggered?
[16:58:37] <gnarf> like what is "this"
[16:58:49] <gnarf> it means different things in different contexts
[16:59:06] <NexHD> yes
[16:59:11] <HAPPYFUNBRO> $(this).click(function ()
[16:59:12] <NexHD> i have
[16:59:20] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf $(this).click(function () {
[16:59:28] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: that tells me nothing
[16:59:29] <HAPPYFUNBRO> so it looks like it is the pager link
[16:59:31] <NexHD> this
[16:59:32] <NexHD> <button data-file="day">Day</button>
[16:59:33] <gnarf> console.log( this )?
[16:59:38] <gnarf> use a debugger?
[16:59:38] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[16:59:39] <HAPPYFUNBRO> sec
[16:59:44] <gnarf> what kind of function is it?
[16:59:54] <gnarf> event handler? each callback? ajax callback?
[17:00:10] <gnarf> also
[17:00:13] <gnarf> remember events bubble
[17:00:26] <gnarf> so if you bound it on ".view" it should catch if you trigger anything inside
[17:02:26] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf Sorry, I'm really really new to ajax (I just started learning about it today to solve this problem). If you go to the following page, scroll to the bottom, and click "next page," you will see the console.log output for $(this)
[17:02:28] <HAPPYFUNBRO> http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[17:03:38] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: thats the ajax object
[17:03:41] <gnarf> you don't want that
[17:03:49] <gnarf> you want the element
[17:04:01] <gnarf> can you paste that section of the pager code on a gist?
[17:04:56] <HAPPYFUNBRO> yeah sec
[17:06:33] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf https://gist.github.com/492891459bef917fbab8
[17:06:50] <HAPPYFUNBRO> line 104 is where it gets interestingh
[17:06:53] <HAPPYFUNBRO> *interesting
[17:06:57] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: so hey
[17:07:05] <gnarf> "target" is the ".view"
[17:07:24] <jqurious> wait until line 666
[17:07:27] <gnarf> jQuery( target ).trigger
[17:07:53] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf hm. I think I'm doing that on line 160
[17:07:56] <HAPPYFUNBRO> right?
[17:08:38] <gnarf> then $(".view").bind( "pagechange", function() { ... });
[17:08:57] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[17:09:08] <HAPPYFUNBRO> so what if I need to simulate a click on that pager?
[17:10:05] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: then you bind on the .view
[17:10:25] <gnarf> it doesn't matter that you trigger the click on the pager link
[17:12:09] <HAPPYFUNBRO> hm
[17:12:32] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok, so I did that, but I do not appear to be entering into the .bind function
[17:13:03] <gnarf> what file/ what line is the bind on?
[17:13:34] <gnarf> not $(view)
[17:13:37] <gnarf> $(target)
[17:14:35] <HAPPYFUNBRO> https://gist.github.com/492891459bef917fbab8 look at the bottom of the paste. the bind is in a different file
[17:15:04] <HAPPYFUNBRO> as you can see, I logged PAGE CHANGED!, but it does not appear to be showing up
[17:17:00] <dabear_> $(this) would be wrong though, it equals the ajax settings object (just to let you know, I see it is commented out)
[17:17:26] <HAPPYFUNBRO> yeah, gnarf informed me of that a bit ago. thanks though
[17:17:31] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I am doing this correctly, right?
[17:17:32] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: what line and file (in the debugger on your testsite)
[17:17:41] <gnarf> where is the bind
[17:18:09] <HAPPYFUNBRO> sec
[17:18:20] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: the testsite still has $(view).trigger, that should be $(target).trigger
[17:18:36] <gnarf> target is defined on line 114
[17:18:40] <gnarf> in ajax_view.js
[17:18:40] <dabear_> eval(callback)(target, response);
[17:18:42] <dabear_> eval
[17:18:46] <dabear_> hah!
[17:19:17] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[17:19:22] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I changed it to target trigger
[17:19:28] <HAPPYFUNBRO> let me get you the other line
[17:19:31] <gnarf> thanks
[17:19:41] <NexHD> why this code return me a undefined value ?? $(this).data("file")
[17:19:42] <NexHD> ?
[17:19:57] <HAPPYFUNBRO> jplayer.js:411
[17:19:58] <gnarf> NexHD: perhaps because data("file") hasn't been set yet?
[17:20:03] <HAPPYFUNBRO> gnarf jplayer.js:411
[17:20:05] <dabear_> NexHD: because there is no file data, or you fcked up :)
[17:20:34] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: get rid of the find('.pager-next a')
[17:20:41] <gnarf> also
[17:20:48] <gnarf> I would probably not do that inside of the other click event
[17:21:03] <HAPPYFUNBRO> why?
[17:21:19] <gnarf> perhaps use http://api.jquery.com/one
[17:21:21] <gnarf> instead
[17:21:22] <NexHD> i have set this <button data-file="day">Day</button>
[17:21:38] <gnarf> do you want that event to happen on every page click, or only that one?
[17:21:43] <gnarf> because you haven't bound that event
[17:21:57] <gnarf> until you execute that line of code
[17:22:06] <NexHD> dabear i have set that data why give me undefined?
[17:22:15] <HAPPYFUNBRO> well
[17:22:29] <HAPPYFUNBRO> at the moment, I am implementing continuous play, so I need to simulate the page click
[17:22:40] <gnarf> if you execute that click handler twice, you will end up calling the continous play function twice
[17:22:47] <gnarf> because you have now bound it twice
[17:22:56] <gnarf> you probably want .one() instead of .bind()
[17:23:06] <HAPPYFUNBRO> so if you click the last player on the page, when it completes, it will switch to the next page
[17:23:17] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: right
[17:23:20] <HAPPYFUNBRO> oh shit
[17:23:21] <HAPPYFUNBRO> it worked
[17:23:24] <HAPPYFUNBRO> !!!
[17:23:25] <HAPPYFUNBRO> sorta
[17:24:03] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: you understand why you want .one() ?
[17:24:08] <HAPPYFUNBRO> no
[17:24:21] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: so - after you bind that event to the view
[17:24:32] <gnarf> if you click on a pager it will execute every time
[17:24:39] <HAPPYFUNBRO> oh
[17:24:42] <HAPPYFUNBRO> well I do want that
[17:24:47] <gnarf> HAPPYFUNBRO: not really
[17:24:55] <gnarf> because you are binding that event every time you actually want that
[17:25:00] <HAPPYFUNBRO> oh
[17:25:01] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[17:25:04] <HAPPYFUNBRO> well one it is then
[17:25:04] <gnarf> so the second time it happens, it runs twice :)
[17:27:22] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[17:27:30] <HAPPYFUNBRO> let's see if I can get this player to actually play now...
[18:22:49] <haochong> join #backbone
[18:26:35] <systemfault> haochong: You might want: #DocumentCloud instead
[18:27:12] <haochong> #DocumentCloud
[18:28:18] <systemfault> o_O
[18:28:21] <haochong> thanks
[18:28:31] <systemfault> You're welcome
[18:28:58] <HarryPitfall> I'm really love the 1.9 ui...
[18:29:17] <HarryPitfall> .menu() and .popup() are so cool
[18:36:19] <wroathe> http://jsfiddle.net/m7qmY/
[18:36:33] <wroathe> So I've got navigation set up with nested uls that need to be shown with javascript
[18:37:46] <oksushi> wroathe: it should work without javascript
[18:38:00] <oksushi> add javascript to improve the functionality
[18:38:04] <wroathe> In every browser except for IE the mouseleave event only fires if the mouse leaves the list item (including child elements like the ul). In IE8 the mouseleave event fires when they leave the list item (excluding child elements). The result is that the ul collapses before you can mouse over it.
[18:38:09] <wroathe> Yeah, I already did that.
[18:38:12] <oksushi> :)
[18:38:23] <wroathe> &:hover ul { display: block; visibility: visible; }
[18:39:02] <wroathe> Does anyone know why it doesn't treat the child ul in the list item as a part of the bounding box for your mouse?
[18:39:56] <wroathe> This is the javascript: https://gist.github.com/1f12d0ab46524a22a800
[18:40:18] <Patabugen> wroathe: You can do that with CSS
[18:40:33] <Patabugen> The dropdown menus, you don't need Javascript
[18:40:43] <wroathe> Yeah, I know. It works nicely when I use pure CSS. I'd like to make the dropdown animated though
[18:40:46] <wroathe> and for that you need JS
[18:40:52] <Patabugen> Ah fair enough
[18:41:22] <ryanneufeld> wroathe: you can animate with css too, using transitions
[18:41:30] <ryanneufeld> unless you need compat with older browsers
[18:41:55] <wroathe> Well yeah, I know these things. I'm just trying to iron out some weird behaviour in IE8 right now.
[18:56:42] <shoky> wroathe the problem is the filter
[19:01:01] <shoky> wroathe: http://jsfiddle.net/m7qmY/6/
[19:02:52] <igcewieling> not really sure how to word this question.  I set var data; in the global scope, my $.ajax success: is function(data) {....    after the ajax loads and I click on a button on the page my click handler does not see the information places in the data variable by the ajax call.
[19:03:43] <shoky> igcewieling: in the function(data) {   you're aware that 'data' now refers to the local argument to the callback, and not the global one, yes ?
[19:03:47] <igcewieling> I worked around the issue by making my success: function(temp_data) {... and setting data = temp_data; in the function, but it seems ugly.
[19:04:08] <shoky> igcewieling: what's ugly is having a global variable called data
[19:04:21] <igcewieling> shoky: that is how it appears.  How can I make function(data) reference the global data.
[19:04:26] <igcewieling> shoky: it is really called '
[19:04:31] <igcewieling> phone' not 'data'
[19:04:41] <shoky> huh.
[19:05:11] <igcewieling> it is really function(phone), but since phone would not mean anything here, I called it something else in my question
[19:05:41] <igcewieling> my phone = temp_phone; workaround does work, it just seems ugly to me
[19:10:54] <Patabugen> igcewieling the question is why you have the global variable at all
[19:12:20] <igcewieling> Patabugen: I need to access the data from a click handler outside the ajax success function.  Is there a better way to do it?
[19:13:13] <igcewieling> I could stuff all the data into a bunch of hidden input fields on the form I'm using, but that seems even worse.
[19:13:31] <shoky> whatever the scope of your stuff, your issue is a naming one. make a namespace object: var globals = { phone: null };     function(phone) { globals.phone = phone }
[19:15:13] <shoky> (that function is a callback to $.ajax for example..)
[19:15:24] <igcewieling> shoky: *nod*  your suggestion is about as I got before wondering if there was a better way.  I did some reading on variable scopes before coming here. 8-
[19:16:02] <shoky> igcewieling: namespaces are there to solve this issue.. a common one in any language
[19:16:21] <shoky> igcewieling: in JS it's simple to just make an object for namespacing.
[19:16:21] <Patabugen> You might be able to store it in a .data() on the relevant element. Not sure how good practice that is?
[19:16:31] <shoky> who said there's a relevant element
[19:16:38] <shoky> there's no problem with "glboal" variables
[19:16:50] <Patabugen> On whatever the click handler is bound to
[19:17:15] <shoky> if they're local to your $(document).ready callback for example, they are still "global" to any inner function inside
[19:17:18] <igcewieling> shoky: any ideas on accessing the data from an ajax call from outside the success function (in my case a .click handler) without using global variables.  I'm not a big fan of using global variables, but realize sometimes they are the best solution
[19:18:41] <shoky> igcewieling: you definitely don't need a _real_ global variable, but that's besides the point. the point is your issue is not a scoping issue, it's a naming issue
[19:18:49] <Patabugen> With the limited knowlege of what you're doing, I'd suggest shoky's previous suggestion
[19:19:26] <Patabugen> Which is, essentially, the same as the solution you called ugly earlier
[19:19:58] <igcewieling> Patabugen: *nof*
[19:20:07] <igcewieling> thanks for the information and advice.
[19:29:49] <wingy> how do i get all these elements: <span class="ng-scope"><span>    I tried $('span.ng-scope:empty').remove(); but it didnt remove all of them
[19:32:12] <Patabugen> wingy: Which ones didn't it remove?
[19:32:26] <wingy> Patabugen: i have a lot of those in my DOM
[19:32:29] <wingy> i wanna remove all of them
[19:32:51] <wingy> that selector just fetched one of them
[19:33:24] <wingy> $('span.ng-scope') fetches all of them but i want to only fetch the empty ones not when they contain something
[19:34:07] <Patabugen> and with the :empty it only returned one?
[19:34:43] <wingy> yes
[19:34:45] <wingy> strange
[19:35:43] <Patabugen> And the second time you run it, does it still return one? (what should have been the second the first time around)
[19:36:48] <wingy> Patabugen: it still returns one
[19:36:50] <wingy> the same it seems
[19:37:05] <Patabugen> If it's returning the same, then it's not removing it either
[19:37:49] <wingy> i actually tried without the remove()
[19:37:50] <Patabugen> wingy: I can't see what's wrong from that, perhaps a jsfiddle.net will help
[19:38:00] <wingy> when doing $('span.ng-scope:empty').remove() it doesn't return anything the second time
[19:38:03] <wingy> i guess its removed
[19:39:20] <Patabugen> Is there more than one ng-scope which is empty?
[19:39:51] <wingy> yes
[19:41:29] <wingy> cant figure out what the issue is myself
[19:41:53] <wingy> $('<div><span class="ng-scope"></span><span class="ng-scope">Not Empty</span><span class="ng-scope"></span></div>').find('span.ng-scope:empty')
[19:41:55] <wingy> works great
[19:41:57] <wingy> grr
[19:42:14] <Patabugen> If you remove the :empty the second time
[19:42:17] <Patabugen> what do you get?
[19:42:28] <Patabugen> Check that theres not whitespace or something which'll cause it to not be empty
[19:42:32] <Patabugen> I don't know the specifics of empty();
[19:46:32] <wingy> ok
[19:46:38] <wingy> thx for the help
[19:52:39] <javalover> hi nobody is answering in #css so....
[19:53:13] <javalover> I have an image that is centered inside a div  <div><img align = "center"></div>  and I want this <p>mystuff<p> to show up in the upper left of that centered image
[20:04:37] <HAPPYFUNBRO> can someone explain to me why the following code returns an empty element for "currentActivePlayer" on the following page, even though the element exists on the page once the "pagechange" event occurs? http://pastebin.com/qsP4hDMQ http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[20:25:32] <HAPPYFUNBRO> Could someone explain why the following code is retaining references to the OLD DOM hierarchy upon loading a new DOM hierarchy (via AJAX)? MOre notes in the paste: http://pastebin.com/UgMeypZf
[21:37:33] <myself_> Hi, how to draw image at given position?
[21:39:59] <myself__> no ideas?
[21:48:38] <neohunter> Hello, hey how i can trigger the select event of jqueryUI Autocomplete?
[21:54:46] <neohunter> i read the event name is autocompletechange, but trigger('autocompletechange') doesnt seems to work... any ideas?
[21:56:21] <shoky> neohunter: those events are for you to listen for, not trigger yourself. you can use the search method
[21:57:12] <neohunter> shoky: i need to trigger it, i have a link for fill that value.. and need to call that event to execute some verification code...
[21:57:25] <neohunter> shoky: there's no way to trigger it?
[21:58:24] <shoky> neohunter: i told you, use the search method
[21:59:48] <neohunter> shoky: But autocomplete('search') will show the suggestions list, i dont want my user to see any suggestions, the field is already filled with the right value.
[22:00:03] <shoky> oh
[22:00:44] <shoky> neohunter: then do whatever you do in response to the change event..
[22:00:55] <shoky> instead of trying to trigger it yourself.
[22:03:29] <shoky> neohunter: also if you do .bind('autocompletechange', ...) instead of putting 'change' option when initializing the autocomplete, then it should also run when you just do .trigger('autocompletechange')
[22:04:36] <shoky> neohunter: but like you said, you dont want to trigger an event. you want to execute some verification code. so do that
[22:04:50] <neohunter> thanks
[22:26:16] <Zneeuw> hi, anyone know anything about jquery.layout plugin?
[22:31:45] <neohunter> why .animate({'width': '70%'}, make the width to 200% before applying the animation?
[22:39:34] <shoky> neohunter: it doesn't
[22:40:11] <shoky> Zneeuw: i used it some
[22:40:18] <neohunter> well im not sure why but.. it make the element really LOONG (more bigger than parent element) before appling the animation
[22:40:41] <shoky> neohunter: jsfiddle it ;p
[22:42:02] <tw2113> diddle the fiddle yo
[22:42:53] <shoky> nyan
[22:52:17] <Zneeuw> ok, shoky
[22:52:54] <Zneeuw> when i try to apply layout to a div i've added via javascript, it doesnt work.
[22:53:10] <Zneeuw> when the div is present on page load it works fine
[22:53:34] <Zneeuw> no error messages are produced
[22:53:51] <Zneeuw> and the div becomes invisible
[23:01:58] <EasyCo> Hey guys, I'm building this jquery widget that generates a 12 months calendar and adds it to the DOM. One of the abilities is to be able to click a button that shows the previous 3 months every time you click it. I'm just wondering what would be the ideal way to store the first month that is being displayed in the calendar so that I know which 3 months to display for each successive click.
[23:03:27] <EasyCo> I thought of just querying the DOM each time to see which is the first displayed month or I could create an object and keep the information in there. but I was wondering which would be the best/fastest
[23:09:30] <shoky> Zneeuw: works fine for me. you sure it's not a css issue? like when you put it in the html it had some specified height, but from your js you're not giving it any height?
[23:10:15] <Zneeuw> mmmmm, let me try that......
[23:11:01] <Zneeuw> that's it man, thanks a lot :-)
[23:12:12] <Zneeuw> i mean thanks, shoky
