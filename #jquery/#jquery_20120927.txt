[00:09:06] <chare> what is the point of submitting a function into $()          https://gist.github.com/3792618
[00:09:15] <isdp> radiobuttons are annoyingee
[00:09:19] <isdp> ... *
[00:09:46] <AdamPDotty> o Annoying; o Not annoying
[00:10:34] <Cork> chare: thats a shorthand for dom ready
[00:10:42] <isdp> http://jsfiddle.net/GcyXy/ try the radio buttons and see what happens
[00:10:48] <chare> Cork: what do you mean by dom ready
[00:10:56] <Cork> ?.ready @ chare
[00:10:57] <bot-t> chare, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[00:11:03] <AdamPDotty> document is completely loaded
[00:11:19] <Cork> well the term is that the dom has stabilized
[00:11:43] <Cork> so that you can actually try to find the dom representation of the html you loaded
[00:13:28] <isdp> @ AdamPDotty
[00:14:15] <Cork> isdp: remember that ppl don't know you code so unless you actually says whats expected and what happens
[00:14:23] <Cork> its going to be hard to tell
[00:14:30] <AdamPDotty> not what Id expect, but I would suspect the script
[00:14:58] <isdp> yeah me too, is it because a change happens per click?
[00:15:10] <chare> Cork: in that code what is this.value referring to what is this?
[00:15:15] <isdp> because if so, how else should i do this..
[00:15:44] <Cork> chare: the '$("#order_credit_card_number")' dom element
[00:16:20] <Cork> can't tell anything more then that cause its not in the pb
[00:16:59] <AdamPDotty> escaped quotes, repeating code
[00:17:02] <AdamPDotty> hard to read anyway
[00:17:46] <AdamPDotty> somewhere inbetween has to be a place where you check the chosen element against the initial one
[00:18:08] <isdp> whom you guys talking to?
[00:18:08] <AdamPDotty> but as the initial one is still vali, you should not have to
[00:18:23] <AdamPDotty> It means You.
[00:18:27] * AdamPDotty points
[00:23:57] <anli_> Is there a way to find the max z-index?
[00:24:43] <Cork> find it?
[00:24:43] <anli_> I have to loop all elements, right?
[00:24:54] <anli_> Yeah, I am creating a dialog and want it topmost
[00:25:02] <Cork> you mean find what element has the highest z-index?
[00:25:16] <anli_> Just to find the value, so I can use that value + 1
[00:25:31] <Cork> the normal solution is to have a global variable and constantly increase it
[00:25:40] <anli_> That does not suit me
[00:25:46] <anli_> I stopped reading at "global" ;)
[00:26:25] <Cork> looping through the entire dom every time you need to set a z-index has louse performance
[00:26:35] <anli_> I bet you would not notice
[00:26:43] <anli_> I only do it when the dialog is coming up
[00:26:44] <Cork> depends on the size of your page
[00:27:02] <Cork> anli_: if your using jquery-ui thats what the dialog is doing
[00:27:19] <anli_> I do not, I am creating some own crap
[00:27:29] <anli_> jquery ui loops?
[00:27:36] <anli_> To find z-index
[00:28:06] <Cork> $.ui.dialog.maxZ
[00:28:07] <Cork> no
[00:28:12] <Cork> they use that variable
[00:29:01] <Eviltwin> window.getNextZIndex = (function() { var z = 1; return function() { return z++; }; })();
[00:29:04] <Eviltwin> There
[00:29:07] <Eviltwin> Not global
[00:29:24] <Cork> getNextZIndex is kinda a global :)
[00:29:47] <Cork> actually not kinda it is a global variable, it just points to a function
[00:31:24] <anli_> Good that its a function
[00:31:30] <Cork> -_-'
[00:33:26] <Eviltwin> Bending the rules
[00:33:29] <Eviltwin> FTW
[00:33:37] <AdamPDotty> evil, I tell ya
[00:34:22] <Cork> normally why you don't want global variables is cause you don't want to pollute the global scope, if you pollute the global scope with a function or a variable, makes no difference what so ever
[00:34:49] <Cork> as its a question of namespace
[00:49:44] <helly^> I have a field that peope should enter some text in. It the last word should always be bin. If it's not entered then I need jquery to enter it. So if I type helly bin it does nothing, If i just type helly  it adds bin. Any ideas? :-)
[00:53:34] <isdp> what is wrong with this?
[00:53:36] <isdp> $.totalPrice = function() { 		$("[data-price]").each(function () { 			alert($(this)); 		}; 	};
[00:54:20] <Cork> nothing, it depends on what you want to do
[00:54:53] <JelmerD> jsdp you are missing some )
[00:54:53] <isdp> i have data-price elements everywhere on every input
[00:55:07] <isdp> JelmerD: where?
[00:55:18] <JelmerD> jsdp .each(function()}; should be .each(function(){});
[00:55:22] <Already> helly^ $("element").text().substring($("element").text().length-3,$("element").text().length) == "bin"
[00:55:30] <JelmerD> Because you are not closing the .each() now
[00:55:52] <isdp> thnx ^"^
[00:55:57] <JelmerD> jsdp yw
[00:55:59] <helly^> Already: Thanks, I'll read up on that!
[00:56:13] <Cork> helly^: var $input = $('selector'); if($input.val().substr(-3) !== 'bin') { $input.val($input.val() + 'bin'); }
[00:56:14] <JelmerD> isdp: --^
[00:56:40] <Cork> text won't work for input elements
[00:57:01] <helly^> Ok. Thanks.
[00:57:31] <helly^> I'll have to read more about jquery. Need to learn it.
[00:57:57] <Already> Well Corks solution is clearly nicer and already does all you want. Mine would have had to be part of a click event or similar.
[00:58:03] <Cork> helly^: most of that is actually plain javascript
[00:58:39] <Already> In essence its a comparison of the last 3 characters of the content of the selector.
[00:59:09] <chare> tell me that someone here has a codeschool account with access to coffeescript course
[00:59:26] <helly^> Yeah. So if I write hellybin it would not add bin. So I better change it to -4 !==' bin' ?
[00:59:51] <Cork> yes
[00:59:57] <Cork> if thats what you want
[01:00:16] <helly^> It is. Thanks!
[01:00:18] <Cork> you just said to add bin at the end :)

[01:05:42] <dns-away> $('.chat').last().attr('id').after(data); How to insert data after class chat last attr ID ?
[01:12:14] <dns-away> hi
[01:12:35] <dns-away> want help ? :-)
[01:13:09] <Cork> attr('id').after doesn't make any sense
[01:13:33] <Cork> you want to add an attribute?
[01:13:35] <Cork> or what?
[01:13:56] <dns-away> i want add data to after last class .chat :-)
[01:14:20] <Cork> $.('.chat').last().after(data) then
[01:15:38] <fonko> hey guys how can i select a radio button value as default and stick it to a variable?
[01:15:48] <fonko> $('input[type=radio]:checked') like this but "name" ?
[01:15:56] <dns-away> mhm
[01:15:58] <dns-away> thanks.
[01:15:59] <dns-away> :-)
[01:16:29] <Cork> fonko: $('input[type=radio][value="target"]') ?
[01:16:53] <fonko> Cork, thanks man!
[01:40:24] <Usse> e va be daiO_O
[01:53:02] <anli_> I get 0 as computed width when using div.width(), the element is appended to the document
[01:53:10] <anli_> Isnt it layed out directly afterwards?
[01:53:29] <Cork> unless it or one of its parent are display:none
[01:54:02] <anli_> ah, it is, so I have to use visibility instead
[01:54:14] <anli_> Or opacity
[01:54:16] <anli_> thx
[01:55:52] <nbvnmgu> Hello, I got script that involves clicking. It restarts after action for "click" is done. It should not. http://pastebin.com/NpbWXeZh
[01:56:04] <nbvnmgu> It's short script
[01:57:05] <Eviltwin> I don't know what "restarts" means
[01:57:54] <nbvnmgu> I mean it start's again. I have dragged link and clicked it. Then "whoom" all elemnts are at the same place.
[01:58:15] <seutje> I dunno what wybrano_jedna_z_mozliwosci means and why it's being declared in this way
[01:58:52] <Eviltwin> Is this a CFL?
[01:58:57] <nbvnmgu> to get function name in debug console after use of console.trace
[01:59:17] <seutje> either do function wybrano_jedna_z_mozliwosci() { /*blabla*/} $('.bla').on('click', wybrano_jedna_z_mozliwosci); or use an anonymous function, but this declaring as you need them is sorta odd
[01:59:33] <puzzleled> I'm puzzled by the U.S. Presidential Elections
[01:59:35] <NexHD> hi , why this regex is not work? ^[A-Z][a-z]\s{3,15}$
[01:59:46] <Eviltwin> Looks like seutje's got this handled for you
[01:59:50] <puzzleled> The USA touts itself as a shining beacon of democracy
[01:59:59] <Eviltwin> NexHD: Is not work? How you know is not work?
[02:00:04] <seutje> Eviltwin: what? no I'm just confused by the construct
[02:00:09] <puzzleled> But why are the US traditional media not covering Presidential Candidates Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, Virgil Goode and Rocky Anderson?
[02:00:17] <nbvnmgu> Eviltwin: for me?
[02:00:18] <NexHD> i have tested that
[02:00:36] <puzzleled> Why are the US traditional media acting like they are censoring some Presidential Candidates?
[02:01:12] <puzzleled> I'm very puzzled by that since the USA touts itself as a shining beacon of democracy
[02:01:31] <NexHD> how i add a whitespace after word?
[02:01:46] <nbvnmgu> It looks like script freezes web browser
[02:01:56] <seutje> puzzleled: I think you have us confused for #RandomPoliticalRants
[02:02:32] <puzzleled> ok seutje
[02:02:41] <Eviltwin> NexHD: Explain what you think that regex does
[02:04:28] <NexHD> i dont speak very good english
[02:04:41] <Eviltwin> NexHD: http://jsfiddle.net/WTRBP/
[02:07:08] <diverdude> hello, how do i check if there is a value in Result['json']['MessageconversationthreadsMessagedirectory']['active'] and if it is equal to 0 in a short and precise way?
[02:07:49] <nbvnmgu> seutje: do you see any reason why this script might restart?
[02:09:11] <diverdude> any1?
[02:12:08] <Cork> ?eval Result = {}; ((Result['json'] || {})['MessageconversationthreadsMessagedirectory']|| {})['active'] === 0
[02:12:12] <bot-t> Cork: false
[02:12:18] <Cork> diverdude: ^
[02:12:53] <Cork> its the shortest form i know of, but its not exactly pretty :)
[02:13:50] <diverdude> Cork: hmm seems difficult to make a generic function for that
[02:14:21] <Cork> diverdude: you could make a loop and take an array of keys
[02:14:28] <superfluous> If I have links "a.feed" with click() functions added to them inside a div ".feed_list", and then i append more of the links to the div, will it go and add the .click() function to them over again?
[02:14:29] <nbvnmgu> This should not restart. AM I right?
[02:14:36] <Cork> and if you do, you could make the code much more readable
[02:14:58] <superfluous> I'm not the developer, but it seems that, when more links are appended, the appended ones click() functions are called once, whereas the ones that were already there are called twice
[02:15:04] <Cork> superfluous: no
[02:15:05] <superfluous> if that makes sense?
[02:15:13] <Cork> superfluous: you need to use delegated event listeners
[02:15:17] <Cork> ?.delegate
[02:15:18] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:15:32] <Cork> superfluous: on has a new syntax for that too see ?.on
[02:15:33] <bot-t> superfluous, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:15:43] <Cork> ?.on 2
[02:15:45] <bot-t> Cork, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:15:48] <Cork> lol
[02:15:53] <Cork> right forgot about that bug
[02:16:32] <nbvnmgu> Why it should be /delegate() ?
[02:16:46] <Cork> what do you mean?
[02:17:03] <nbvnmgu> Why not other method?
[02:17:14] <Cork> what?
[02:17:28] <Cork> delegate is similar to bind or on
[02:17:40] <Cork> nbvnmgu: are you talking about the shorthands?
[02:17:46] <Cork> like .click() ?
[02:17:47] <nbvnmgu> yes
[02:17:53] <Cork> those are never delegated
[02:17:59] <nbvnmgu> or .live
[02:17:59] <nbvnmgu> ah
[02:18:01] <Cork> they bind to the event you selected
[02:18:06] <Cork> no you don't want to use live
[02:18:14] <Cork> its broken by design, and its depricated
[02:18:17] <nbvnmgu> what use instead?
[02:18:22] <Cork> delegate or on
[02:18:27] <nbvnmgu> ok
[02:18:42] <nbvnmgu> maybe it restarts my script
[02:18:58] <Cork> $().delegate('selector', 'click', function() {}) is the same as $('selector').live('click, function() {});
[02:19:25] <Cork> uh...
[02:19:26] <Cork> sorry
[02:19:33] <nbvnmgu> ?
[02:19:34] <Cork> $(document).delegate('selector', 'click', function() {}) is the same
[02:19:48] <isdp> how can i let jQuery remember what div is shown and not shown via the URL?
[02:19:54] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'selector', function() {}) is the on form for the same thing
[02:20:35] <Cork> isdp: only way to do that would be to either parse the url, add a query at the end, or a hash
[02:20:36] <Already> I'd guess you'd have to supply some kind of get parameters and some kind mapping isdp
[02:20:53] <superfluous> sorry, right now its just $('a.feed').click(function{ stuff }); and i dont think theres much i can do to change it
[02:21:10] <Cork> superfluous: then you need to run that one each element
[02:21:33] <Cork> cause those bind to 'a.feed' elements that it finds when that line is run
[02:21:37] <Cork> it never finds new ones
[02:22:00] <Cork> *one for each element
[02:22:39] <nbvnmgu> How to use $(this) inside delegate()?
[02:22:47] <Cork> no difference
[02:22:56] <Cork> it works the same as normal event listeners
[02:22:57] <nbvnmgu> Hmm
[02:23:32] <superfluous> so lets say you run it again
[02:23:38] <nbvnmgu> I do not get it script still restarts
[02:23:42] <superfluous> if you add 2 click()s to it, will they both be run?
[02:23:48] <Cork> yes
[02:24:01] <superfluous> is there a way to tell if it has already been added and have it only be added once?
[02:24:07] <Cork> superfluous: so you need to select only the newly added elements
[02:24:12] <superfluous> yep
[02:24:17] <Cork> superfluous: there is but thats tricky
[02:24:36] <Cork> best is to find the element before you add them and make a list of them, then bind the click event
[02:24:39] <superfluous> I'm an iOS guy, I don't do much javascript, so sorry if these are basic questions
[02:24:52] <Cork> its not really basic
[02:25:02] <Cork> this is where many trip up at the beginning
[02:25:17] <nbvnmgu> Cork, jq script should not restart by itself? I got just few appends() an 2 event listeners....
[02:25:35] <Cork> nbvnmgu: do you have a link?
[02:25:47] <Cork> nbvnmgu: as it is i don't know what your talking about
[02:25:52] <superfluous> what its doing is load, notify - add the click() to all in the div - append some, notify - add the click() to all of them
[02:25:58] <superfluous> so i can see why its failing...
[02:26:35] <Cork> superfluous: the "correct" solution would be to replace the .click with on/delegate and do it delegated
[02:26:44] <Cork> that would make the code much more dynamic
[02:26:49] <nbvnmgu> Cork: http://pastebin.com/7dR4ueaW
[02:26:51] <Cork> and it would just work
[02:27:00] <superfluous> Yeah... after you explained it, sent me links, I can understand that
[02:27:08] <superfluous> but I'm pretty sure i'm not in a position to change that
[02:27:22] <Cork> nbvnmgu: your not preventing the a links from executing
[02:27:35] <Cork> function(event) { event.preventDefault() }
[02:28:09] <Cork> nbvnmgu: and if your using a tags without working hrefs, you're doing it wrong
[02:28:22] <nbvnmgu> Oho, will try.
[02:29:09] * Cork cries when he sees theses annoying <a href="#"></a> links
[02:29:32] <superfluous> whats the point of them?
[02:29:41] <Cork> it was a hack for pre ie6
[02:29:47] <Cork> and ppl just keep doing it
[02:29:55] <Cork> but theres no point what so ever to do it any more
[02:30:00] <superfluous> wow, thats old
[02:30:09] <Cork> (ie5.5 didn't catch click event on anything other then a tags)
[02:30:24] <Cork> or rather pre ie6
[02:30:55] <Cork> i even have to hack jquery-ui for this
[02:33:33] <nbvnmgu> I have just replaced a with p and works ok now :D
[02:34:11] <Cork> nbvnmgu: from what it looks like you already have li element that should be enough
[02:34:32] <Cork> and span is prob a better replacement then p, cause a is an inline element and so is span, while p is a block element
[02:34:56] <nbvnmgu> Indeed, I have just reused some old code, now figured out it needs few changes to adopt it to new project
[02:41:03] <Cork> <_<'
[02:41:46] <Cork> bot-t: was that your evil twin?
[02:41:47] <bot-t> Cork, As I see it, yes.
[02:44:19] <BlaDe^> hi guys.. on my page if an element isn't ready it's given a .cLoading class.. I have setup
[02:44:25] <seutje> noooes, bot-t don't leave me
[02:44:48] <BlaDe^> $('.cLoading').each(function() { .... }); I want to run a setInterval which will poll the API based on this.id to see if it's ready
[02:45:01] <BlaDe^> how should I keep track of each individual timer to kill them as the success fires?
[02:45:04] <Cork> he keeps running in and out of the room, going to the bathroom?
[02:45:51] <Cork> BlaDe^: you don't want to fire that many timers if you don't have to
[02:46:15] <BlaDe^> Cork:  why not? it's only one specific page which does it and it will only happen in a certain scenario
[02:46:25] <Cork> BlaDe^: and you should prob try using setTimeout instead of setInterval, cause setInterval can cause you to do over frequent requests
[02:46:40] <uiopoiuytre> Can I separate events: click on "div #id" and on "div #plane p" ?
[02:46:43] <Cork> BlaDe^: cause times are expensive
[02:46:50] <uiopoiuytre> Can I separate events: click on "div #id" and on "div #id p" ?
[02:47:05] <Cork> uiopoiuytre: its pointless to have selectors on the left of id's
[02:47:21] <BlaDe^> Cork:  can I name a variable like var t + this.id = function() { .. } ?
[02:47:35] <uiopoiuytre> yes, I put it here just to make clear I thinkl about div
[02:47:43] <anli_> I cant read .css('opacity') in chrome
[02:47:47] <anli_> Why?
[02:48:02] <BlaDe^> i guess i have to use window[var]
[02:48:07] <Cork> BlaDe^: BlaDe^ just keep an array with the different id's and just remove them from the array when the loaded event happens
[02:48:29] <Cork> BlaDe^: and from an setTimeout loop, check the range of ids you have
[02:48:41] <Cork> BlaDe^: and when the array is empty stop the loop
[02:48:47] <NexHD> i have a problem on this if (!/^[A-Z][a-z]\s[A-Z][a-z]{3,15}$/.test(value)) can somebody help me?
[02:49:16] <Cork> BlaDe^: didn't say that before, but the reason you don't want to use setInterval, is that it doesn't take into account how long it takes to run the function your running
[02:49:32] <Cork> BlaDe^: so you might end up queuing events that runs back to back
[02:50:26] <BlaDe^> Cork:  there isn't a loaded event, i have to poll
[02:50:37] <BlaDe^> although that may work
[02:50:42] <Cork> BlaDe^: fine still, thats how you should do it
[02:51:05] <uiopoiuytre> Cork: so is it possible?
[02:51:30] <uiopoiuytre> right now it takes bot events when I click on <p>
[02:51:36] <uiopoiuytre> *both
[02:51:44] <Cork> uiopoiuytre: sure, you just have to make sure you're parent selector filter out the bubbeling events
[02:52:08] <Cork> uiopoiuytre: or that the sub selectors stop the bubbeling (stopPropagation())
[02:53:24] <Cork> NexHD: so you want to see if it match <BigChar><SmallChar><space><BitChar><SmallChar><SmallChar><SmallChar>... ?
[02:54:34] <NexHD> <TEST>
[02:54:39] <phrearch> hi
[02:54:41] <NexHD> <TEST><space><TEST>
[02:54:45] <NexHD> this
[02:54:52] <Cork> that doesn't match that regex
[02:55:03] <phrearch> is there a selector i can use to filter on all elements with a certain attribute?
[02:55:08] <NexHD> can you help me please?
[02:55:19] <Cork> it matches one big char, followed by one small char, followed by one space, followed by one big char followed by 3 to 15 small chars
[02:56:01] <Cork> whats 3-15 meant to be?
[02:56:09] <NexHD> the lenght
[02:56:14] <Cork> of the entire string?
[02:56:28] <NexHD> entire input
[02:56:36] <Cork> /^([A-Za-z]+\s+[A-Za-z]+){3,15}$/
[02:56:40] <Cork> that should work then
[02:56:57] <NexHD> needs " + " for a new space and space?
[02:57:09] <Cork> each space and each character section yes
[02:57:14] <uiopoiuytre> Works, thanks
[02:57:15] <Cork> else you only allow them one time
[02:57:34] <Cork> ugg wait no
[02:57:36] <Cork> that doens't work
[02:57:41] <Cork> hmm
[02:57:44] <NexHD> thanks
[02:58:01] <Cork> /^[A-Za-z{3,15}$/ might be closer to what you want
[02:58:04] <Cork> bah
[02:58:12] <Cork> * /^[A-Za-z]{3,15}$/
[02:58:29] <Cork> but that allows " teAtes"
[02:59:52] <Cork> alternatively you can try something like /^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z\s]{1,13}[A-Za-z]$/
[03:00:20] <NexHD> the first is not work?
[03:00:24] <Cork> no
[03:00:53] <DarsVaeda> hi, I use this to scroll a text container http://codepaste.net/ztfz4v problem is in fullscreen firefox the whole page scrolls up and down even thou it does not fill up the space
[03:00:55] <DarsVaeda> any idea?
[03:00:58] <NexHD> the last how work?
[03:01:02] <Cork> theres no way to express how long the match is allowed to be in regex
[03:01:12] <Cork> NexHD: kinda
[03:01:20] <Cork> it depends on what limitations you want
[03:01:43] <Cork> the last one checks that the first and last character is an alpha character
[03:02:12] <Cork> and in between is any of the allowed characters up to 13 characters
[03:02:26] <Cork> but that means "A s d g e g r A" is allowed
[03:02:39] <Cork> so it all depends on what you really need to check
[03:03:19] <Cork> NexHD: should the "word" sections ever be more then two?
[03:03:36] <NexHD> only two
[03:03:45] <Cork> and is there a limitation to how long each word section can be?
[03:03:55] <NexHD> yes
[03:04:00] <Cork> whats that?
[03:04:15] <NexHD> 3 and 16
[03:04:29] <Cork> ah
[03:04:42] <Cork> then /^[A-Za-z]{3,16}\s[A-Za-z]{3,16}$/ should work perfectly
[03:04:53] <davetarmac> morning all
[03:06:59] <NexHD> this is work? <Test><space><Test> ?
[03:08:02] <Cork> ?eval /^[A-Za-z]{3,16}\s[A-Za-z]{3,16}$/.test('Test Test')
[03:08:03] <bot-t> Cork: true
[03:08:07] <Cork> ?eval /^[A-Za-z]{3,16}\s[A-Za-z]{3,16}$/.test('Te st Test')

[03:09:01] <davetarmac> Using Drupal, I have an jQuery accordion menu, but when the user goes to a category page covered by the accordion, the accordion menu is closed when I would prefer it to be open. I have looked at the code and I need to do this in jQuery separately. I know I need to change certain inline styles and classes on certain elements, however I don't know how to trigger that when landing on that page (not a document.ready(), the check to s
[03:09:01] <davetarmac> what page it's on and run a function accordingly).
[03:09:21] <davetarmac> I hope that made sense, but perhaps a link to the site might illustrate things better: http://allenbridge.launcharea.co.uk/people/senior-advisors
[03:09:36] <crome> hey
[03:09:43] <crome> can I ask something qunit related here?
[03:09:53] <davetarmac> if you go there, you would expect the Senior Advisers menu to be open
[03:09:53] <Cork> ?ask @ crome
[03:09:54] <bot-t> crome, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:10:26] <crome> I wasnt really asking for a permission to ask, more like to know if there is a better place for it, but thanks for wasting those precious characters on me
[03:11:22] <Cork> crome: is you check that message thats part of that too
[03:11:24] <davetarmac> I know I can put a function() inside a click action, but is there one just for loading the page based on classes...
[03:11:47] <davetarmac> jQuery('.class.path .here').function(…); ?
[03:12:00] <Cork> crome: asking if its ok to ask, just means that ppl have to ask what it is you want to ask
[03:12:17] <NodeX> just stick it in document.ready davetarmac ?
[03:12:26] <Cork> crome: so just ask it if your not sure, and ppl will direct you to where to ask if its the wrong place
[03:12:57] <crome> if I have a simple test like this: http://pastebin.com/bEdS3r4M it reports an assertion failure first, then it produces an Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'bar' of undefined, and then start() is never called
[03:13:01] <crome> am I doing something retarded here?
[03:13:22] <davetarmac> NodeX: There are a number of actions I need to run, so I was wondering if it was easier to frame it in a function, but if it's OK to do it just in the document.ready then that's fine by me :)
[03:13:47] <zChrisWrk> i was wondering if you can use some syntax so that you assign autocomplete too all inputs that are named "return_product[x][name]" where x is random
[03:14:18] <zChrisWrk> All elements which have a attribute name that starts with return_product and ends with [name]. Is that possible?
[03:14:29] <Cork> crome: whats defining those functions?
[03:14:40] <Cork> notEqial, Equal?
[03:15:01] <crome> to correct myself: it only reports an assertion failure if I start it as a synchronous test without the setTimeout thing
[03:15:05] <crome> Cork: qunit
[03:15:16] <Cork> crome: you should prob check in its source and see what it does
[03:15:34] <Cork> might be that Equal trows or something, while notEqual only outputs to the console
[03:15:39] <Cork> but i'm only guessing
[03:15:59] <uiopoiuytre> jquery SVG lib is good for drawing lines?
[03:19:39] <crome> Cork: none of them throw, the assertions are logged but I havent went through the whole inner workings of qunit
[03:19:48] <crome> gone*
[03:24:48] <Houman> hi, i have a number of checkboxes in different nodes.  Only one can be active at a time and I would like to see which one is currently selected: $('.last_active_tab') how do i do this please?
[03:26:50] <zChrisWrk> Can i select attributes that contains ]?
[03:26:55] <zChrisWrk> do i use \] then?
[03:30:02] <Krambiorix> i try to loop through all input boxes on the page that have class user ,  --> $(".user").each( but the loop is never entered
[03:30:30] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[03:30:36] <NodeX> and the <input />
[03:33:19] <Krambiorix> NodeX, http://pastebin.com/3YbZcmCs
[03:34:59] <xec> Krambiorix: is the selector inside docready?
[03:36:33] <xec> Krambiorix: because i just copypasted your code and it runs fine after the dom is ready http://jsfiddle.net/g3pYU/
[03:37:22] <Krambiorix> xec, it doesn't run before dom ready? All input boxes are added by jquery so i presume it is
[03:38:05] <xec> Krambiorix: well that might be your problem right there. any chance the inputs are added after the selector?
[03:39:00] <Krambiorix> xec, ow you're right
[03:39:03] <Houman> Hi, sorry I had a disconnection.  I have a fiddle here:  http://jsfiddle.net/CnMyA/1/  I like to select the node that has a checked checkbox. How do I do this please?
[03:40:09] <xec> Houman: the .last_active_tab *is* the checkbox, the > means child
[03:40:18] <xec> Houman: so just do ".last_active_tab:checked"
[03:42:06] <Krambiorix> xec, thx!
[03:44:11] <xec> yw :)
[03:46:28] <Krambiorix> how can i remove the last row in a table?  i tried with this but i think i'm way off: $("#fbusers tr").index($("#fbusers tr").length()).remove();
[03:47:41] <zChrisWrk> Is there a way to select a name that contains ] or [in jquery?
[03:48:26] <Krambiorix> ok nevermind my question
[03:48:59] <xec> zChrisWrk: escaping it didn't work?
[03:50:28] <xec> zChrisWrk: actually, i don't think you would need to even escape it

[03:50:40] <grifx> hello again
[03:51:07] <grifx> I want to send a Json to an url
[03:51:12] <grifx> and get a json
[03:51:33] <grifx> Can I use the .getJSON() ?
[03:51:54] <xec> grifx: yes
[03:52:18] <Houman> xec: Thank you very much. It seems to be working
[03:52:59] <Krambiorix> Now i have this problem with looping : http://pastebin.com/p1QeRRSk
[03:53:21] <grifx> xec:  $.getJSON("path", DATA, function(data){
[03:53:29] <grifx> xec: DATA will be my json
[03:53:29] <grifx> ?
[03:54:11] <xec> grifx: almost. DATA will be a JS object. JSON in javascript is technically a string
[03:54:15] <zChrisWrk> xec, i see, thanks
[03:55:30] <grifx> xec: ok, but i'm not sure to understand. If I put my json in the DATA
[03:55:32] <DarsVaeda> I have a div in another div I hide overflow and with animate scrollTop I can simulate scrolling
[03:55:33] <grifx> it will work ?
[03:55:49] <xec> grifx: maybe, try it and see. it really depends on what DATA really is
[03:55:49] <DarsVaeda> is it possible to jump to a specific element?
[03:56:45] <xec> ?g jquery scrollto @ DarsVaeda
[03:56:46] <grifx> xec: it's a json JSON.stringify(values);
[03:56:52] <grifx> xec: ok thanks
[03:57:17] <DarsVaeda> xec: that doesnt seem to exist
[03:57:20] <xec> DarsVaeda: where is the bot when we need it? anyway - there is a scrollTo plugin that i think would do the job - google it ;)
[04:00:28] <zChrisWrk> xec, i i think i know my problem. I add elements after the document has been created so .autocomplete never connects to that element
[04:01:07] <xec> that would be a problem indeed :)
[04:01:14] <Krambiorix> ok i tried to remove all table rows but NOT the first one: this doesn't work: $("#fbtable").find("tr:gt(0)").remove();  ->any idea?
[04:01:29] <xec> Krambiorix: come again? what are you trying to do?
[04:01:42] <NexHD> still not get this to work...can someone help me with this /^[A-Z][a-z]\s{3,15}$/ ? should be like the regex for full name
[04:01:55] <xec> Krambiorix: maybe .slice() can help you
[04:02:56] <xec> NexHD: maybe more like /^[a-z\s]{3,15}$/i
[04:03:36] <NexHD> xec that would work like this John Smith ?
[04:03:58] <xec> NexHD: caveats include: names longer than 15 chars or non-english letters
[04:04:34] <NexHD> 15 chars
[04:05:06] <xec> NexHD: you can test in the console yourself, try typing in: /^[a-z\s]{3,15}$/i.test("John Smith")
[04:06:46] <zChrisWrk> xec, how can i add autocomplete to such element?
[04:07:01] <xec> zChrisWrk: to what element? one that doesn't exist? you can't
[04:07:16] <xec> zChrisWrk: run the plugin after it exists.
[04:07:28] <zChrisWrk> xec, its impossible :P
[04:07:32] <xec> logic, it works
[04:07:56] <zChrisWrk> well for example i can use live to bind click but not autocomplete it seems
[04:08:21] <xec> zChrisWrk: no, what's impossible is manipulating something that doesn't exist. binding events is different because of propagation
[04:08:51] <zChrisWrk> i guess i have to write my own autocomplete then with the keyup event ?
[04:09:18] <xec> zChrisWrk: what? no. just attach the autocomplete after the input is created. simple.
[04:09:54] <zChrisWrk> xec, how do i do that ?
[04:10:27] <xec> zChrisWrk: do i really need to hold your hand through this? how is the input added?
[04:11:06] <zChrisWrk> xec: Through a javascript
[04:11:10] <xec> awesome.
[04:11:23] <xec> that's not generic at all
[04:11:39] <xec> zChrisWrk: this is really basic stuff
[04:12:26] <zChrisWrk> xec, okey
[04:15:05] <davetarmac> what's the method for selecting the element after an element, i.e. a <div> after an <h3>
[04:15:12] <davetarmac> but ONLY the first one
[04:16:09] <davetarmac> if, of course, there is such a method
[04:16:14] <xec> first what, div after each h3, or first div following any h3
[04:16:26] <davetarmac> the first div after a defined h3
[04:16:29] <xec> $('h3 + div')
[04:16:36] <davetarmac> oh… that simple, eh?
[04:16:45] <davetarmac> I feel dumb for almost asking
[04:16:49] <xec> if you mean next sibling, then yes
[04:16:54] <davetarmac> I feel almost dumb for asking even
[04:17:08] <davetarmac> it's on the same level, not a child element
[04:17:15] <techouse> can anyone help me. i want to execute a custom js function with jquery validator on an error
[04:17:32] <xec> davetarmac: that is the definition of a sibling, yes :)
[04:17:42] <techouse> so insead of just a simple message i want to execute a function
[04:17:48] <davetarmac> xec: fair enough
[04:18:17] <davetarmac> of course it is! I'm getting confused between family members and relations
[04:18:25] <davetarmac> sorry - I haven't had my beef madras lunch yet
[04:18:35] <xec> hehe, need moar beef
[04:19:30] <davetarmac> xec: works a treat, thanks :)

[04:23:30] <Guest63237> hi, i have a question, i'm using ajaxSend to intercept all outgoing ajax requests. I need to access the request headers. How can i do that?
[04:27:39] <blaman> hi! I'd like to know how to run window.load() on a page I just loaded with JQ's load(). ready() gets called when I do this, as per docs, but window.load() does not. I would like to call it myself, but I don't know how to do that
[04:27:57] <davetarmac> xec: there is one thing that I was wondering can be fixed - since it's using multiple jQuery scripts, it's not closing the now active menu item (http://allenbridge.launcharea.co.uk/people/management-team for example)
[04:29:52] <xec> davetarmac: sorry i'm not following. at all. and i gotta get back to work
[04:30:42] <davetarmac> xec: no worries
[04:30:50] <davetarmac> thanks for the help
[04:30:53] <xec> good luck!
[04:35:43] <ansolas> is it possible to make somthing like this: <input type="text" value="doit()"/>
[04:35:45] <ansolas> ?
[04:36:20] <ansolas> incase the doit function is self executing?
[04:37:18] <xec> ansolas: you should always strive to separate your markup from your js. you can use $('input').val('whatever') to set the value of an input
[04:37:29] <xec> (from your js file)
[04:38:54] <ansolas> i know , but in that case it would be awesome convenient, using it in a jade template
[04:39:01] <ansolas> heh
[04:39:07] <ansolas> ok i do that way
[04:41:16] <ansolas> thanks
[04:51:05] <amccloud> when writing a plugin is there a way to get the selector that was used?
[04:51:53] <rgr> any recommendations for generating .min.js files?

[04:52:56] <rgr> thanks
[04:55:59] <jeffsmykil> I'm having this very strange behavior happen where a popover is happening underneath the overlay

[05:01:36] <shoky> blaman: what?
[05:04:48] <blaman> shoky: I'm loading a new page w/ ajax using load(). As per the docs, this executes scripts, which is what I want. But, window.load() does not run, so I want to run it myself
[05:05:39] <davetarmac> OK, having some serious bother with this page http://allenbridge.launcharea.co.uk/people/management-team
[05:07:07] <termite> davetarmac: whats the problem with the page?
[05:07:23] <davetarmac> termite: just writing now :) but thanks for the eagerness
[05:07:39] <seutje> he's not alone
[05:07:53] <davetarmac> I'm using this script http://pastebin.com/WpEn5nYK to show the particular menu depending on the page the user is on
[05:08:02] <shoky> blaman:  can you change the loaded page
[05:08:26] <davetarmac> however when you click on another title, the original open one stays open until it is clicked on again, then it behaves as it should
[05:08:39] <davetarmac> there are no errors in the Console
[05:08:42] <blaman> shoky: yes, that works fine
[05:09:04] <seutje> duuude, cache your selectors, please :(
[05:09:32] <shoky> blaman: i mean, can you edit the actual page, giving a name to the callback function you're passing to $(window).load(..)
[05:09:41] <davetarmac> using the click function I put in to essentially reverse the original action won't work as it treats the click to hide it each time
[05:09:52] <shoky> or .. not using $(window).load
[05:10:18] <blaman> ah, well, we have a big mess here, so I've been told to change as little code as possible
[05:10:42] <shoky> it's only a small refactor
[05:10:45] <blaman> big mess, as in 10 duplicate pages, and we have to change the code in each one by hand (please don't ask)
[05:10:52] <blaman> (heh)
[05:11:11] <shoky> anyway, you don't "call" $(window).load
[05:11:35] <Rudeboy> I need a block to be exposed when clicked on, but hidden before the page loads. What is the best way to do this? (It will be pushing away other elements, so opacity:0 will not work here)
[05:11:40] <shoky> (or you do call it, passing the function you want run on the window load event..)
[05:11:56] <shoky> but if you want to run a function, call it directly
[05:12:18] <davetarmac> seutje: me to cache my selectors?
[05:13:20] <termite> davetarmac: do a var body = jQuery('body');  and then use body instead of looking up the same selector over and over
[05:13:41] <termite> or use a switch
[05:13:53] <davetarmac> termite: how would that affect the jQuery('h3.title-senior_advisers + div').css('display','block');
[05:14:20] <termite> he was just making a suggest on coding practices
[05:14:37] <davetarmac> yeah, that's cool - I'm just curious
[05:14:58] <davetarmac> normally whilst trying to get it to work I write it long hand, then neaten up when it's working
[05:15:01] <blaman> hm, when JQ's loads calls my complete callback, is the page completely loaded, or just the DOM?
[05:15:25] <blaman> (complete callback for JQ's load() I mean)
[05:15:59] <termite> davetarmac: what browser are you seeing this behavior?  Seems to be working fine in chrome
[05:16:00] <blaman> the docs say, "post-processing and HTML insertion", I'm not sure if this is the same state as when you are in $(window).load
[05:16:08] <davetarmac> termite: I'm using Chrome
[05:16:23] <davetarmac> the behaviour I'm seeing is:
[05:16:30] <davetarmac> 1. Load page, menu is open
[05:16:32] <jastor> chrome doesnt like my jquer at all :P works fine in firefox
[05:17:05] <davetarmac> 2. click on another title (e.g. Senior Advisers) and Management Team stays open when it needs to shut
[05:17:10] <jastor> no errors in either firefox/chrome firebug
[05:17:22] <jastor> neiter*
[05:17:27] <davetarmac> if you click on management Team, then click on Senior Advisors, then it will shut and behave as expected
[05:17:45] <shoky> blaman: just the DOM i believe
[05:17:50] <davetarmac> the problem lies in the fact that I'm overwriting jQuery used in a Drupal accordion module
[05:18:13] <blaman> shoky: ok thanks, I'll see if I can come up with something
[05:18:44] <termite> davetarmac: hmm when I switch tabs the accordion is closing for me
[05:19:19] <davetarmac> termite: not for me :(
[05:19:22] <davetarmac> how bizarre
[05:19:29] <termite> did you shift refrsh
[05:19:34] <davetarmac> I did, yeah
[05:19:49] <davetarmac> and flushed the cache tables etc.
[05:19:52] <termite> do you use drush
[05:19:58] <davetarmac> No, I don't
[05:20:06] <davetarmac> it's shared hosting with no SSH
[05:20:22] <termite> and you don't have CDN or varnish running
[05:20:38] <davetarmac> what is varnish?
[05:20:55] <davetarmac> cache
[05:20:58] <davetarmac> no, I don't
[05:21:00] <termite> http://drupal.org/project/varnish
[05:21:12] <termite> hmm what version of chrome are you running
[05:21:33] <termite> are you logged into drupal?
[05:21:51] <davetarmac> termite: 22
[05:21:57] <davetarmac> yeah I am
[05:22:04] <uiopoiuytre> How to append <p> to div of id "here"?
[05:22:06] <termite> davetarmac: logout and look
[05:22:39] <davetarmac> same thing termite
[05:22:41] <shoky> uiopoiuytre: $('#here').append('<p>')
[05:22:41] <uiopoiuytre> $("#here ").append($("<p">).text("sometext"))  ?
[05:22:54] <uiopoiuytre> hmm
[05:22:55] <shoky> almost
[05:23:01] <shoky> you have the right idea, yes
[05:23:44] <uiopoiuytre>   $("#plan").append($("<p>").text(ntrmnl.text()).css({"position":"absolute","left":e.pageX,"top":e.pageY})) seems to not work, e is event
[05:24:09] <uiopoiuytre> no p is added to div as firebug shows
[05:25:29] <termite> davetarmac: i am using 21
[05:25:44] <termite> works in firefox
[05:26:23] <shoky> uiopoiuytre: works fine http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8SLsZ/
[05:26:38] <termite> and in safari
[05:26:52] <seutje> davetarmac: I meant it as in don't repeat $('body') 17 times, but instead define var $body = $('body'); once and then use $body instead of $('body')
[05:27:15] <seutje> I guess body is a pretty marginal example, but still, no need to re-query
[05:27:30] <davetarmac> true seutje
[05:27:39] <termite> works in IE
[05:27:50] <termite> I do notice some lag though
[05:27:59] <termite> opening the new selection
[05:28:14] <davetarmac> termite: sorry to be a pain, but can you tell me exactly what you're testing
[05:29:32] <uiopoiuytre> strange handler for event is called it even executes w/o warnings/errors but no paragraph is append int div....
[05:29:34] <termite> davetarmac:  I start at he "senior Advisor" tab and look to see if the menu on the right is open to the right selection then I click on management team and check to see if the old section on the right has closed and the new one is open
[05:30:19] <davetarmac> termite: interesting - that's not actually working for me
[05:30:23] <davetarmac> at all :(
[05:30:23] <amccloud> Cork: Thanks.
[05:31:01] <termite> drop in a break point and see how it move through that login
[05:31:03] <termite> logic
[05:32:27] <uiopoiuytre> logic, logic, where are you? ...
[05:32:51] <davetarmac> I'll do that, thanks
[05:32:58] <shoky> uiopoiuytre: try to reproduce the problem in jsfiddle
[05:34:01] <termite> davetarmac:  Just a piece of advice check how many database calls you are making.  Drupal can be EXTREMELY slow.  You may want to cache things like the footer
[05:34:19] <davetarmac> termite: I might look at that Varnish to be honest
[05:34:27] <davetarmac> Drupal is a PITA when it comes to db calls
[05:35:00] <termite> davetarmac: I also noticed your page is a little jumpy
[05:35:13] <termite> when you click from section to section
[05:36:39] <termite> davetarmac: since your whole site is pretty much static I would recommend using CloudFlare and nginx. you will see a 3498% increase at least
[05:36:53] <davetarmac> I'll take a look at those :)
[05:38:07] <seutje> davetarmac: lil example on how you can reduce repetition in your code: http://jsfiddle.net/vCBUV/
[05:38:44] <hiall> Anyone help me understand why I can achieve a closest).prev() in console but when I apply it to the js file it fails? http://paste2.org/p/2273936
[05:39:21] <NexHD> need i little help please with this http://jsfiddle.net/4Ckfp/
[05:39:27] <ohcibi> i have a form and want to monitor it for user input (as the user types) i tried to bind all the possible events like change, click, keypress etc. to a function but it starts to get messy.. is there a plugin or a tutorial for this problem?
[05:39:34] <davetarmac> wow - that's a lot nicer than the bits I was writing
[05:39:37] <termite> seutje: he gave the website and I can't reproduce the error
[05:39:57] <Cork> hiall: break that section down and test each step with console.log
[05:40:01] <seutje> termite: WAT?
[05:40:05] <termite> seutje sorry misread
[05:40:12] <seutje> no sorry, only happy!
[05:40:24] <Cork> hiall: make sure that each step, closest, prev, find results in an element (.length > 0)
[05:40:53] <hiall> Cork: the prev() finds null. but in console it works...
[05:41:06] <hiall> will retry :) ty

[05:44:07] <eregi> Hei! I'm trying to get an json response from this google link - http://pastebin.com/9bwhDKTS it works in the browser, but if I do a $.get it wont give any response, whic is wierd...
[05:44:11] <Cork> NexHD: casefull with naming elements the same as things that exists in the dom
[05:44:21] <Cork> NexHD: that has a tendency to make things break
[05:44:54] <xec> good thing he misspelled "length" then xD
[05:45:09] <seutje> NexHD: did you mean after() instead of insertAfter()?
[05:45:12] <Cork> yup :)
[05:45:16] <seutje> ->http://jsfiddle.net/4Ckfp/1/
[05:45:20] <seutje> not sure what the intention is

[05:47:16] <eregi> SO you think that google is not allowing to acces include that file into my scripts?
[05:47:42] <johnkpaul> eregi: did you read that mdn page?
[05:47:50] <johnkpaul> it's your browser that is doing the not-allowing
[05:48:19] <johnkpaul> eregi: they do have jsonp support though

[05:50:12] <johnkpaul> eregi: did you read the jsonp section of the docs?
[05:50:30] <eregi> johnkpaul: looking at your link
[05:50:43] <johnkpaul> I mean the jquery docs, but yeah, you should read both
[05:50:52] <johnkpaul> getJSON does something special if the url has "callback=?" in it
[05:51:07] <johnkpaul> and the google api server will also do something special if the url has "callback=something" in it
[05:51:24] <johnkpaul> that blog post wille xplain what that something special is
[05:53:42] <Solow> Hi. I'm using jqueryui draggable, with the "clone" helper. However, the element I'm dragging has a parent with a tooltip. The clone clones inside of this parent so while dragging the tooltip goes mental... Can it also be cloned outside of the parent?
[05:58:53] <velcrobots> anyone know how I can get the "back to top" button - it appears as you scroll down a bit - INSIDE the #wrap div?  http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/6qrQF/
[06:01:57] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: isn't that what that example does?
[06:02:01] <ddssc_> anyone good with datatables here?
[06:02:32] <Cork> velcrobots: by NOT setting it to position: fixed;
[06:02:48] <velcrobots> no - make the window wider to see what i mean.  the button is fixed relative to the viewport/window (with just css).  I guess I need to figure out how far in to go with "$(window).width();" and some math, but having trouble with it
[06:02:54] <Cork> velcrobots: by definition that positions it relative to the viewport
[06:03:36] <Cork> velcrobots: so if you use position: fixed; you need to calculate the position of its parent and change its right: value
[06:03:51] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: do you want it always in the bottom right of the window?
[06:04:19] <velcrobots> no i want it at the bottom right of the orange div #wrap
[06:04:30] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: oh, that's easy
[06:05:14] <velcrobots> i figure if lol
[06:05:23] <velcrobots> i get the width
[06:05:26] <velcrobots> $(window).width();
[06:05:34] <velcrobots> subtract the width of my wrap div
[06:05:54] <velcrobots> then add maybe 10p to that and make it the right:value
[06:05:56] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: ur trying too hard http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/6qrQF/7/
[06:06:03] <Cork> velcrobots: you need to redo that every time the window resize even triggers though
[06:06:37] <ddssc_> why is this thing getting called twice? http://pastebin.com/peirAidj
[06:06:43] <velcrobots> yeah so i need to do on docready and then windoresize
[06:06:46] <ddssc_> the code inside is called twice
[06:07:12] <Cork> ddssc_: cause something calls $.get twice?
[06:07:36] <Cork> velcrobots: yup thats the way to do it
[06:07:42] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: check the link, you can fix it with css
[06:07:52] <velcrobots> file - that doesn't quite do it
[06:07:59] <velcrobots> first, it needs to be inside the orange
[06:08:01] <Cork> FiLeVeR10: thats outside the orange for me
[06:08:16] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: oh, np, it can be inside
[06:08:37] <Cork> FiLeVeR10: position: fixed can't be inside
[06:09:06] <ddssc_> Cork, nope. that's the thing, it just executes the success function twice for no reason.
[06:09:07] <Cork> its always relative to the parent if you set it position: fixed
[06:09:21] <Cork> ddssc_: that makes no sense
[06:09:34] <ddssc_> Cork, uh yea, hence why im asking :)
[06:09:54] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/6qrQF/11/
[06:09:56] <Cork> ddssc_: i mean unless you've found a browser bug, that can't really happen
[06:10:21] <ddssc_> Cork, I checked in debugger, the line before this call does not get called twice, however the code inside the get callback functiion gets called twice
[06:10:45] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: you can just adjust the offset with margin-left in the css.
[06:11:36] <velcrobots> i see.  ok, so can you explain this?  CSS is actually my strong suit.  i'll admit i've not often used position:fixed - but I've also never used a percentage like you did with "left:50%"
[06:11:48] <Cork> ah, forgot about the percent margin hack
[06:11:57] <velcrobots> percent margin hack?
[06:12:01] <velcrobots> google....
[06:12:02] <velcrobots> lol
[06:12:08] <velcrobots> i'll read up on it
[06:12:18] <Cork> you position the element centered, then you move it back with a margin
[06:12:27] <Cork> check dead center
[06:12:31] <Cork> ?g dead center
[06:12:32] <bot-t> Cork, deadCENTER Film - http://www.deadcenterfilm.org/
[06:12:36] <Cork> ?g css dead center
[06:12:42] <bot-t> Cork, Dead Centre - http://www.wpdfd.com/editorial/thebox/deadcentre4.html
[06:13:13] <FiLeVeR10> Cork: percent margin hack uses negative margins, i did not...
[06:13:32] <Cork> FiLeVeR10: you did not but its still the same logic
[06:13:55] <velcrobots> well either way, much appreciated.  another tool in my belt.  this is cross-browser?
[06:14:16] <Cork> it would be a bit wonky in older ie browsers
[06:14:24] <Cork> but thats cause they don't support position: fixed
[06:14:46] <Cork> fixed came in ie7
[06:14:58] <velcrobots> that's fine
[06:15:11] <ddssc_> my $.get gets called twice for no goddamned reason... nice
[06:15:12] <FiLeVeR10> like 2% of traffic is going to be that old in ie to worry about
[06:15:17] <velcrobots> again, thanks.  very awesome
[06:16:52] <rootcoma> is this a valid way to check if a field is set?  return this.moderators[username.toLowerCase()] ? true : false;
[06:19:40] <norm> can jQuery fire a callback after an element is inserted into the DOM?
[06:19:53] <norm> i.e. anytime i do .append(), .replace(), etc
[06:22:03] <ddssc_> norm, don't think so. what you need it for?
[06:22:38] <norm> ddssc_: anytime my app inserts a <time> element, i want to reformat the timestamp into something human readable
[06:23:48] <mg983> Hi guys
[06:24:48] <termite> norm: you can do it with keyframe animations and css
[06:25:11] <termite> norm: here is a very clever way to do it. http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion
[06:25:38] <mg983> I have a lot of functions that use the same DOM elements -- What I am looking to do is cache the selectors by setting them into variables so that I am not traversing the DOM every time I reference the elements --- Do I set those as part of the anonymous function with ready ?
[06:26:17] <norm> termite: that is … clever :)
[06:26:41] <ddssc_> norm, perhaps you can do it serverside.
[06:27:52] <AdamPDotty> mg: basically yes
[06:29:51] <ansolas> @norm: append().callback() ?
[06:30:36] <ansolas> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3113853/jquery-perform-callback-after-append
[06:31:32] <norm> ansolas: yeah i'm actually doing .each() now :)
[06:32:33] <mg983> no?
[06:34:59] <seutje> mg983: yeah, in the scope where they're being used
[06:35:09] <seutje> no need to leak beyond that
[06:35:52] <mg983> seutje : now -- what if I want to declare a function that uses those cached selectors -- do I have to nest the function within the ready anonymous function?
[06:36:56] <seutje> mg983: yeah, either that, or expose them in a global namespace, or make instancable objects and store them internally
[06:37:04] <seutje> instanciable*?
[06:37:21] <mg983> How would I make an instance-able object?
[06:37:23] <seutje> instanceable*?
[06:37:39] <velcrobots> one last thing - any idea why the "back to top" button flickers as the page scrolls back up?  http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/6qrQF/11/
[06:40:11] <inad922> hello
[06:40:43] <ddssc_> how do I delete event binds for a DOM element once I remove the dom element?
[06:40:47] <inad922> from a <select multiple ...> how can I select the elements which are not selected?
[06:41:48] <johnkpaul> ddssc_: .remove() will do trhat for you
[06:41:54] <seutje> mg983: function MyThingy($jqCollection) { this.$collection = $jqCollection; } MyThingy.prototype.doShit = function() { this.$collection.manipulate(); }; var thingy = new MyThingy($('.foo')); for instance
[06:41:58] <johnkpaul> if you used .detach(), you can use .off, as normal
[06:42:06] <seutje> prolly a terrible example though
[06:42:11] <mg983> lol!
[06:43:00] <seutje> now you can call thingy.doStuff(); and it'll use its internal reference to the jQuery collection
[06:43:15] <MINTTU{MB}> Why is'nt the submit button enabled when all fields are filled? (as i think i've written the jQuery code, see source) http://gstc.eu/gstc_dev/?page=contact
[06:43:31] <seutje> and u could also have secondThingy = new MyThingy($('.different-selector'));
[06:43:48] <seutje> so you have 2 instances, that both work with their own internal reference
[06:44:32] <seutje> this exposes them though, so you could go in and fuck with thingy.$collection, but that's a different story
[06:48:00] <rgr> how would I best go about discovering if a hover is being triggered by an element being dragged over it? I would like to exit the hover if there is a draggable triggering the hover.
[06:49:55] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/6qrQF/29/ it needed to have stop applied, and fadeto instead of fadeout/in since it gets called on each scroll event
[06:51:13] <FiLeVeR10> velcrobots: that's still a bad example of how to accomplish this task though, it can be done much easier with less code
[06:52:01] <velcrobots> thanks, file
[06:53:52] <mg983> Can you detect multiple events in a live method?
[06:54:20] <abisson> Hey guys… quick question. In the 'on' function… is is possible to just have it so that whenever the new element is done loading I go into the "on" function and from there, I can bind events to the newly created object in the dom? For example http://jsfiddle.net/jZhfD/
[06:55:15] <pachet> abisson: you should be using on as a delegator, in that case
[06:55:44] <pachet> if you add the listener first, then load new elements dynamically, they'll trigger the handler if they match the optional selector argument that you pass to .on()
[06:55:49] <pachet> see the docs:
[06:55:51] <pachet> ?.on()
[06:55:52] <bot-t> pachet, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:55:54] <abisson> $("#id_object").on('on', "#id_other", function (e) {..} ?
[06:56:11] <shoky> :O
[06:56:50] <pachet> abisson: when you say 'bind events', but that they're not click events...
[06:56:52] <pachet> what events are they?
[06:57:00] <M3kH> Hi to all!
[06:57:05] <pachet> and how did you plan on triggering them?
[06:57:45] <pachet> abisson: jquery is pretty accommodating when it comes to custom events, but you'll have to trigger them manually on your delegate container
[06:57:49] <abisson> pachet: I want to make that newly created item a "popover" from bootstrap. Ex: $('#example').popover(options)
[06:58:06] <phrearch> hi
[06:58:19] <abisson> so.. in summary. That item will be created dynamically… I want to get it when it is created, and make it become a popover
[06:58:49] <NoiseEee> abisson: just give it the same class as all your popovers, and have a parent container observe the events using .on()/event delegation
[06:59:13] <NoiseEee> $('#parentID').on('click','.classOfPopovers',function(){});
[06:59:43] <MINTTU{MB}> if i create an array : var err = new Array(); , then set 4 elements to false. like err[i] = false; where i = 1,2,3...n
[06:59:47] <adam_lynch> I have a specific thing I need to do, I'm wondering how someone here would approach it
[07:00:10] <MINTTU{MB}> wouldnt err.every(check_err) == 'false' return true if all elements has value false?
[07:00:18] <adam_lynch> I need to take an element, and return a copy of it / copy of it's html minus a certain child's contents
[07:00:21] <abisson> NoiseEee: kk ill try that
[07:00:31] <adam_lynch> latest thing I've tried: http://pastebin.com/dx3d4Szx
[07:00:34] <pachet> whatever event you're using to trigger the popover, you'll need to delegate that event to the child. and your delegated handler would check to see whether the popover plugin had been called on that child element
[07:00:38] <pachet> abisson^
[07:00:42] <adam_lynch> if you need more context, I'll supply :)
[07:00:44] <phrearch> im trying to trigger keypress events on a list of elements, but it only seems to work on the first element
[07:00:50] <phrearch> $(scope).on('change keypress', $(element), self.data, function(event){
[07:01:00] <phrearch> any idea whether i need to use live or delegate instead?
[07:01:18] <pachet> phrearch: just refine your selector
[07:01:26] <pachet> $(element, scope).on(-->
[07:01:41] <joehannes> adam_lynch: --- what about clone?
[07:01:49] <phrearch> pachet: aha thanks!
[07:02:09] <pachet> adam_lynch: yeah, as joehannes said
[07:02:16] <abisson> NoiseEee: but… if I understand the logic of JS… once that the JS is done loading and the popover code is applied to all the object of the class ".popoverClass"… and I add a new object of that class dynamically… how will the code that I added earlier for that class be added to this new one? (hope this makes sense)
[07:02:22] <adam_lynch> joehannes: that seems to actually clone to the DOM for me (even though the docs show clone().appendTo() so it doesn't make much sense)
[07:02:24] <phrearch> pachet: awesome! fixed. thanks :D
[07:02:30] <adam_lynch> regardless, I still have to strip out a bit
[07:02:39] <rgr> what can one do in the "in "part of a jquery hover to prevent the "out" being triggered?
[07:02:43] <pachet> var $clone = $('#foo').clone(); $clone.find('.something').remove(); /* do stuff with clone */
[07:02:56] <pachet> adam_lynch: its not added to the dom until you add it ;[
[07:03:08] <pachet> it's a dom *element*, sure
[07:03:17] <adam_lynch> pachet: hmm yeah that's what I thought
[07:03:21] <adam_lynch> that's what the docs say
[07:03:30] <adam_lynch> but I could've sworn it just copied it for me
[07:03:37] <adam_lynch> I'll try again
[07:03:59] <pachet> rgr: well, you could bind to the actual events
[07:05:01] <pachet> abisson: like i said, your delegated handler will have to check to see if the plugin's been called on that element already
[07:06:39] <pachet> $('#container').on('mouseover.foo', '.someclass', function ( ) { if ( typeof $(this).data('popover_init') === 'undefined' ) { $(this).popover(/*params*/).trigger('mouseenter' /* assuming that's the event you're using */); } })
[07:07:09] <pachet> abisson^  if you felt clever you could do some optimization to say, remove that delegated classname from the element after the popover's been initialized
[07:07:32] <abisson> pachet:  2 sec my boss is talking to me lol
[07:07:38] <pachet> abisson: but the way most people seem to do it is to just set an arbitrary prop on .data to indicate that a plugin has been initialized
[07:07:39] <joehannes> ok, just saw there seems to be jquery 1.8.2 out as it is on jsfiddle ... gotta try this first before I ask
[07:08:15] <jeffsmykil> Anyone know if the rendering/js engines in XP and Vista are essentially the same for IE 7 and IE 8?
[07:10:23] <rgr> the same for it 7 and ie 8?!?
[07:10:27] <rgr> s/it/ie
[07:10:55] <joehannes> ok, 1.8.2 doesn't "resolve" this "issue" ... probably me doing something wrong anyway
[07:10:57] <toxz> has anyone an idea how to check an element if a jquery ui datepicker was applied to it?
[07:11:03] <jeffsmykil> no
[07:11:15] <jeffsmykil> so Vista IE 7 versus XP IE 7
[07:11:51] <ddssc_> why is $('table img') working and $('table').children('img') isnt?
[07:12:07] <adam_lynch> I've created a pastebin showing how this function is used
[07:12:12] <adam_lynch> see if you can spot any problem
[07:12:12] <adam_lynch> http://pastebin.com/PgR1D2Rx
[07:12:23] <MINTTU{MB}> wouldnt err.every(check_err) == 'false' return true if all elements has value false?
[07:12:26] <MINTTU{MB}> ops
[07:12:29] <joehannes> toxz ... there gotta be some kind of stuff added to .data('someAttribute??') ... ? no ?
[07:12:29] <MINTTU{MB}> Why is'nt the submit button enabled when all fields are filled? (as i think i've written the jQuery code, see source) http://gstc.eu/gstc_dev/?page=contact
[07:12:31] <adam_lynch> I know the structure of it isn't nice, no real need to separate it
[07:12:43] <adam_lynch> but I had a lot more code for the template generation at one stage
[07:13:34] <toxz> ddssc_ - because children only gets the direct children and this is tr in a table
[07:13:38] <joehannes> I made me an EventCenter that basically takes care of the problem which was solved in part by $.live ... and now isn't working for me with delegates in the new jquery as I cancel the bubbling
[07:13:51] <ddssc_> toxz, ah yes. cheers
[07:13:54] <adam_lynch> context: I'm taking elements (div.item) and splitting them up into smaller ones, based on the template of the original div.item and a pre-defined max-length (of .carousel_common_item)
[07:14:17] <toxz> ddssc_ - use .find()
[07:14:57] <joehannes> but now for some reason I'm trying to understand ... when I trigger an Event in my EvCenter it actually does a mechanism like ... search subscribers ... if listens to publsiher ... THEN take exactly that subscriber/listener and -> listener.trigger 'event'
[07:15:41] <toxz> joehannes - thats a good idea
[07:15:42] <toxz> thx
[07:16:18] <ddssc_> toxz, about your question, you might wanna check for some aditional classes in the element, jq ui usually adds its own classes.
[07:16:23] <joehannes> now what happens is: the listening element seems not to be triggered at all (debugging call stack) ... but an element higher up the DOM-level receives the event ... BECAUSE delegateTarget and/or currentTarget are for SOME MAGIC REASON I TRY TO UNDERSTAND set to that el!!
[07:16:26] <joehannes> any ideas?
[07:16:42] <joehannes> toxz :)
[07:17:00] <adam_lynch> any ideas anyone?
[07:17:06] <toxz> ddssc_ - yeah i think i will do it this way - i thought i can check via the .datepicker() method, but a class is good
[07:17:08] <adam_lynch> can anyone see a bug in there?
[07:17:35] <adam_lynch> getting that $newItem is undefined in $newItem.find(...)
[07:17:41] <adam_lynch> in the second function
[07:17:41] <adam_lynch> http://pastebin.com/PgR1D2Rx
[07:19:31] <MINTTU{MB}> i have a array err =('false','false','true'); , how can i return alert('In array'); if 'true' is in err
[07:19:44] <rgr> log the $copy
[07:21:13] <interop_madness> MINTTU{MB}, if($.inArray(string, stringArray) >= 0){ alert ('in array'); }
[07:21:22] <adam_lynch> rgr: 2 secs, think I am
[07:21:57] <MINTTU{MB}> thank you, i'll give it a check
[07:22:33] <adam_lynch> rgr: yeah, they're both the same before and after the .empty() call
[07:23:09] <adam_lynch> spotted something but has nothing to do with the "Cannot call the find method of undefined" error
[07:23:33] <adam_lynch> wait sorry what am I saying about before & after the .empty
[07:23:42] <adam_lynch> I had that commented out
[07:25:50] <MINTTU{MB}> interop_madness: if i wanna check if all elements are the same?
[07:27:20] <MINTTU{MB}> in other words, to check if all elements in err =('false','false','true'); , is 'true' or 'false'
[07:27:38] <caddoo> I know there is $('form').serialize()
[07:27:44] <caddoo> is there an easy way to convert it to JSON
[07:28:33] <abisson> pachet: ok I understand what you meant. Would it be faster to set a class for example "popover_uninit" and check for that class. If the class is there, make the object a popover and remove that class?
[07:29:52] <pachet> abisson: yeah that's probably what i would do, except the checking for that class would actually just be managed by the delegation in the first place
[07:30:03] <pachet> and then once you remove the class you'd no longer have to worry about delegating to that element
[07:30:15] <pachet> because the popover init would set up those handlers internally
[07:30:45] <khmer> mmm, popover
[07:30:54] <interop_madness> MINTTU{MB}, not sure about the elegant solution here. obviously you can count each matching element and check if total count matched array.length. for set operations like this, i use linq.js, which is very nice
[07:31:07] <pachet> khmer: i know, it's making me hungry too
[07:32:00] <interop_madness> with linq.js you could do: if(Enumerable.from(array).Where(function(x){ return x != "true" }).Count() > 0) { alert ("not all true"); }
[07:32:06] <MINTTU{MB}> interop_madness: I've actually been pondering about a solution for that a while now, so if you've found one am very pleased if you'll share it :)
[07:32:13] <MINTTU{MB}> This linq.js is ?
[07:32:26] <bartmax> when doing a $.when(xx) on a $.ajax, i can access the response on .then() . Is it possible to add any data to have access while on the 'then' aside from the response from the $.ajax ?
[07:32:39] * bartmax hopes someone understand....
[07:33:15] <interop_madness> linq.js is a kinda "port" of LINQ to javascript. LINQ is a querying toolkit/language extensions for C#
[07:33:34] <pachet> bartmax: yes, use closures
[07:33:34] <bartmax> interop_madness: normally is not good to make one language behave like another language...
[07:33:42] <bartmax> pachet: how? can you guide me a little ?
[07:33:53] <khmer> interop_madness: that library evinces a serious misunderstanding of functional programming techniques
[07:33:58] <abisson> khmer: what is wrong with popover?!
[07:33:59] <abisson> lol
[07:34:21] <khmer> interop_madness: just because it's not called .Where doesn't mean that .filter doesn't work :)
[07:34:35] <khmer> abisson: it's making me freaking hungry, is what
[07:34:45] <pachet> bartmax: var foo = 'some_data'; $.when($.ajax({}), $.ajax({})).then(function(a,b){ /* you can access a, b, and foo here */})
[07:35:00] <bartmax> pachet: thank you! I'll try
[07:35:22] <interop_madness> well i use it mainly for semi-complex set operations based on object properties, which can be formulated elegantly with linq.js
[07:35:47] <interop_madness> of course there may be concise solutions with jquery, but being mainly a C# programmer, i preferred linq.js every now and then
[07:36:45] <interop_madness> another solution would be $.grep() if i'm not mistaken
[07:36:49] <khmer> pachet: $.fn.glaze = function() { $('<div/>').css({ background: 'peachpuff', opacity: 0.2, position: 'absolute', top: this.offset().top, left: this.offset().left, width: this.width(), height: this.height()}).appendTo('body'); }
[07:37:15] <bartmax> pachet: what if i want to access something that happend on the success function inside the ajax call ?
[07:37:32] <abisson> khmer: ohhhhh
[07:37:33] <abisson> ahahah
[07:37:33] <bartmax> pachet: or viceversa, want to access foo inside the success ajax callback ?
[07:38:02] <khmer> interop_madness: i'm being a bit unkind, i'm sorry--it's just strange how often C# programmers imagine that LINQ is the first time set operations were implemented in a library
[07:38:52] <interop_madness> khmer, LINQ is the first time set operations are implemented for the BCL collection classes, nothing more nothing less
[07:38:58] <bartmax> interop_madness: kinda ... $.map = .Select(), $.filter = .Where(), [0] = .FirstOrDefault()
[07:39:30] <khmer> interop_madness: correct! i would be curious to see, in a fiddle or a codepen, where you find linq.js to be the most helpful
[07:39:43] <khmer> interop_madness: for a more javascript-styled equivalent lib i might recommend underscore, but it depends on what you're doing!
[07:40:04] <bartmax> khmer: I think the problem is the naming... I would say ms got this one right, im favored to select instead of map and where instead of filter....
[07:40:06] <abisson> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/nWQgm/ like this?! if so, cheers mate ;)
[07:40:38] <khmer> bartmax: is that just because of its similarity to sql tokens?
[07:41:05] <bartmax> khmer: i think that similarity to brain way of thinking...
[07:41:16] <interop_madness> khmer, my use case was client side faceting of dates of search results
[07:41:44] <bartmax> khmer: when you speak in normal language you say, i want all oranges where they have a defect and not from all those oranges filter those tha have a defect and return it to me... *not sure tho* it's just a guess
[07:42:00] <interop_madness> date facets were displayed in a tree (year nodes with month child nodes) clicking filtered the search results which had the dates as string of format "yyyy-MM-dd"
[07:42:37] <khmer> bartmax: i think that it works great in .net, where under the hood you might actually be manipulating sql record sets, but in any case, they are abstracted into CLR collections
[07:42:50] <khmer> bartmax: outside of .net, i think that it's misleading to make things look like sql when they're not
[07:43:19] <pachet> khmer: 1sec, have to refactor all my projects to leverage $(food).glaze()
[07:43:27] <khmer> pachet: yw
[07:43:37] <khmer> pachet: Fork And Knife This On GitHub
[07:43:43] <bartmax> khmer: yea, still i don't see it as a similarity to sql but to english language. which sql got it too.
[07:43:44] <interop_madness> i concur as far as the "from collection where constraint select stuff" of LINQ is concerned, which i hate
[07:43:45] <pachet> lol
[07:44:16] <khmer> bartmax: i see, but i think that's a difference of opinion--i think of collections as arrays or linked lists, so it makes sense to "filter" them to me
[07:44:23] <interop_madness> what i like about LINQ are the extension methods: .GroupBy(), .Where(), .Select(), .ToDictionary() etc
[07:44:51] <bartmax> khmer: yea im used to it too ... but that's because we are used to arrays...
[07:45:05] <khmer> bartmax: and when we're working with collections in JS....
[07:45:48] <khmer> (the answer is 'we should be!')
[07:45:48] <interop_madness> i might transform the relevant portions to jquery eventually, as one less js import is always a good thing. but i'm not fluent enough in jquery based set operations yet
[07:46:36] <bartmax> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/WET5w/ can u see my q here ? is there any way to access baz in that context ?
[07:47:02] <bartmax> khmer: good point. agree
[07:47:08] <pachet> bartmax: yeah sorry, was just starting to answer. looking at your fiddle now
[07:47:18] <bartmax> pachet: thank you, no worries
[07:47:51] <khmer> bartmax, interop_madness: this is the most civil disagreement i've ever had in this channel, and it's not because i'm the polite one. thanks guys
[07:47:55] <khmer> i hereby brofist you
[07:48:17] <NoiseEee> yeah good job folks

[07:53:00] <eniac> Is it possible to access the request header in the .then() when doing $.when($.ajax(options)).then() ?
[07:55:23] <ezio> eniac, not with the technology you're running on
[07:55:44] <ezio> you need an upgrade buds
[07:56:05] <eniac> ezio: what ?
[07:56:29] <ezio> i'm assuming you do know what eniac means
[07:56:35] <ezio> in the computer world
[07:56:55] <eniac> oh it's a joke
[07:57:10] * ezio pats himself on the back
[07:57:29] * ezio raises the golden cup
[07:57:31] <pachet> eniac: you can't access the request headers ootb, no. they're not exposed on the xhr object that underpins the jqXHR return type. i think that's per the w3 spec but i'm too lazy to look it up
[07:57:37] <ezio> i didn't prepare a speech
[07:57:40] <pachet> you could have your server echo header values back but
[07:57:43] <pachet> seems yucky

[07:59:43] <NexHD> ?
[07:59:58] <starsinmypockets> Is there an obvious flaw in this statement?
[07:59:59] <starsinmypockets> 	if ($('.author-disclosure-relationship-more textarea').val() != "") { 		$(this).closest('td').find('.author-disclosure-relationship-more').show(); 	}
[08:00:27] <starsinmypockets> Assuming that a previous rule has hidden this div
[08:00:40] <starsinmypockets> *statement
[08:00:41] <pachet> starsinmypockets: you have selector inspecificity
[08:00:52] <starsinmypockets> pachet - aha..
[08:01:30] <jastor> grr .. why the frack is chrome acting up .. neither firefox or chromes firebug gives me an JS error yet chrome refuses
[08:01:34] <pachet> you're doing a check against the first textarea that matches the selector in your conditional
[08:01:51] <pachet> which may or may not be contained within the .closest('td')
[08:02:07] <pachet> maybe that's intentional, but it doesnt look like it
[08:02:21] <starsinmypockets> How about this: var that = this; 	if ($(that).find('.author-disclosure-relationship-more textarea').val() != "") { 		$(this).closest('td').find('.author-disclosure-relationship-more').show(); 	}
[08:03:25] <starsinmypockets> ugh no worky this is breaking my brain/day/week
[08:03:47] <pachet> i guess what i was asking was, is the .author-disclosure-whatsit in the conditional supposed to be the same element that you're showing
[08:04:28] <starsinmypockets> pachet - yes
[08:05:07] <starsinmypockets> however, really, all fields with that class just need to be show when their child textarea is populated with a value
[08:06:19] <starsinmypockets> Doesn't sound that hard, right>
[08:06:21] <starsinmypockets> ?
[08:07:34] <pachet> $('.sometextarea_class').on('change.foo', function(){ var $elem = $(this); $elem.closest('.author-disclosure-water-buffalo-lodge').toggle($elem.val()!== ''); })
[08:08:12] <abisson> javascript noob question: When you add an element to the DOM dynamically… does it go through the entire list of .css and adds the style to it?
[08:08:17] <abisson> I know its noob
[08:08:51] <pachet> abisson: not sure what you mean, can you clarify? do you mean the jquery .css method, or existing css rules on the page, or?
[08:09:16] <abisson> pachet: existing css rules sorry
[08:09:16] <tw2113> as an example for abisson
[08:09:30] <tw2113> say you have .myborder { border: solid red 1px; }
[08:09:39] <tw2113> and then with jquery, add that class to a div
[08:09:45] <tw2113> will the div suddenly get a red border
[08:10:08] <abisson> yes, but how is that done
[08:10:33] <tw2113> pixie dust
[08:11:13] <tw2113> or a dom repaint
[08:12:32] <abisson> pixie dust? (you lost me there lol)

[08:20:02] <MINTTU{MB}> by javascript or even jquery
[08:20:15] <cdtank> when is the complete event on promise object (returned when making an ajax call) is firted? is it after the ajax call retruns back with a response or after the statements inside the success handler for that ajax call are executed?
[08:23:42] <NexHD> how i add a " _ " between [a-z[ and [1-9]
[08:23:43] <NexHD> how i add a " _ " between [a-z[ and [1-9]
[08:24:43] <termite> cdtank: are you talking about the dataType filtering?
[08:25:55] <cdtank> termite: no. actually I have to do some time consuming computation inside the success hanbdler for an ajax call.. and want to make sure that the complete event is firecd only when the last statememtn inside that function is executed..
[08:26:18] <cdtank> termite: otherwise it will lead to inconsistent state
[08:26:50] <cdtank> termite: but it think I will just create my own deferred object..whose promise will be resolved only after the success function is completely executed.
[08:26:53] <termite> cdtank: ahh ok
[08:27:08] <cdtank> but out of curiosity..do u know the answer to my question?
[08:27:16] <cdtank> for future referene
[08:28:02] <termite> cdtank: complete gets called after the success and error callbacks have finished
[08:28:45] <cdtank> ohh..nice
[08:28:57] <cdtank>  so i need not wory about having my own defferred objhect.. right?
[08:29:56] <termite> cdtank: yeah.  You still need to watch out for multiple ajax calls messing up state
[08:30:07] <termite> since they can comeback in random order
[08:30:33] <cdtank> termite: hmm..yeah.. thankfully i dont make ajax calls inside ajax calls.
[08:36:32] <scalability-junk> Hey I want to hide an element, but within my function console.log($('element')) returns null, when I run this via the console it works... any idea why the element isn't reckognized?

[08:38:16] <scalability-junk> mh strange using another function works, just this one function seems to interfere with calling the element... damn
[08:39:46] <termite> scalability-junk: so if you create a breakpoint doest it still work at the console
[08:40:20] <NexHD> how i add to regex , the last char to be a letter in one word
[08:40:22] <scalability-junk> termite, got it seems to be some position issue... have to look deeper into my code why :P thanks anyway :P
[08:41:08] <NexHD> i have this regex ^[a-z0-9_]{3,16}$
[08:41:36] <NexHD> i need the _ not to be the last char?
[08:42:44] <ezio> you're going to need to use a lookahead
[08:43:28] <ezio> there is a regex room, though
[08:43:28] <NexHD> what is that?
[08:43:37] <NexHD> aaa
[08:44:01] <NexHD> what is a lookahead?

[08:49:37] <whitenoise> what would cause a .on("click") and/or .bind("click") to fire in 1, 2, 4, 8, 16..
[08:49:57] <whitenoise> even if the content of the function is only a console.log
[08:50:47] <rgr> twhat do you mean fire in 1,2,4 etc?
[08:54:05] <whitenoise> rgr, I mean, the first time I click the button, it fires once, then it fires twice the second click, then 3rd is 4, 4th is 8, 5th is 16 times...
[08:54:35] <whitenoise> i saw that issue on certain things where people were basically stacking divs and causing it to fire multiple timesbut i'm only doing a console.log, so I don't think that should be happening
[08:54:43] <termite> is something you are doing causing multiple bindings
[08:54:57] <starsinmypockets> Feeling brave? Noble? I could _really_ use a hand. http://dpaste.org/MsNfr/ Why doesn't line 51 display this damned field? I'm like 5 hours into this one...
[08:55:05] <whitenoise> termite, to check for that would i basically see if something is binding to that same element more than once?
[08:55:13] <xec_> whitenoise: my guess is you're binding inside the click handler
[08:55:19] <termite> whitenoise: yup
[08:55:31] <whitenoise> okay, let me check for extraneous binds
[08:55:47] <termite> whitenoise: xec_ is spot on I also think that is it

[08:57:50] <termite> starsinmypockets: so you are looking for the first parent TD then looking for all children with that class
[08:57:55] <starsinmypockets> Syco54645_work use parseInt()
[08:58:33] <starsinmypockets> termite - right, it should be my class inside of a parent td
[08:59:07] <starsinmypockets> Syco54645_work it's using the string value
[08:59:22] <Syco54645_work> starsinmypockets: that causes it to sort in an even stranger order. i am sorting alpha numeric items but need the numbers to sort numeric. is there any way to do that?
[08:59:33] <termite> starsinmypockets: if you set a break point what does the selector return
[08:59:57] <starsinmypockets> termite - not sure how to do that :)
[09:00:23] <starsinmypockets> PhanLord - it would prbably be trivially easy to find the solution to that problem via google or stackoverflow.com
[09:00:51] <termite> starsinmypockets: do you know how to use the console?
[09:01:14] <starsinmypockets> termite - yeah, I use console.log(), etc
[09:01:47] <starsinmypockets> PhanLord - I think you do $elemt.attr('checked')
[09:02:26] <termite> starsinmypockets: my guess is that what you are trying to select doesn't exist
[09:02:34] <termite> do you have a webpage?
[09:02:51] <starsinmypockets> Yeah but I can't let you in - i'm sorry...

[09:05:16] <starsinmypockets> termite - roger - I'll look into show()... do you mind explaining how I would use a breakpoint to check a value?
[09:05:24] <starsinmypockets> (as you seem to have suggested I do)
[09:05:32] <ezio> youtube
[09:05:38] <ezio> you need to learn to do more than that
[09:05:56] <termite> starsinmypockets: you really need to know how to debug
[09:06:10] <termite> look into chrome developer tools
[09:06:10] <ezio> one of our profs is famous for saying
[09:06:12] <jarhed> $("#self_rating3").attr("disabled", "disabled");
[09:06:31] <ezio> "if i could teach you two things, it would be to debug and use freenode.  it's all you'll be doing when you go to work."
[09:06:44] <starsinmypockets> termite - I'm using developer tools, and know how to debug... just don't know how to use breakpoints but I'll look into it
[09:06:51] <starsinmypockets> Thanks for the help!
[09:07:10] <starsinmypockets> If I could just learn one thing it would be to learn how to learn..
[09:07:40] <ezio> starsinmypockets, youtube and you'll be mostly up to speed in 15 minutes
[09:07:49] <ezio> just search for chrome debugging
[09:09:38] <starsinmypockets> ezio - cheers

[09:14:55] <jarhed> having trouble getting jquery to apply a "disabled" attribute to a form select, using ID; anybody that can help?
[09:14:56] <jarhed> $("#self_rating3").attr("disabled", "disabled");
[09:15:13] <andornaut> Hi, I have a jquery plugin that extends ":" with a case-insensitive "contains" expr. This worked until recently, where now the function now gets "undefined" for the match arg, where it used to use match[3] to get the param inside of the parenthesis, so for :contains(foo), it match[3] == foo. Any ideas what's going on? Has something changed?
[09:17:01] <andornaut> nvm, bug in 1.8.0, fixed in 1.8.1
[09:17:23] <termite> jarhed: use .prop
[09:18:06] <termite> jarhed: $("#self_rating3").prop("disabled", true);
[09:19:42] <jarhed> termite: SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'prop'

[09:20:45] <jarhed> so that's a negative

[09:24:34] <abisson> I have a ul that is presently sortable. I will be allowing the user to sort it if he presses a button, and saves the status (back to my DB) when he clicks "save". However, in the same page, I can add items to the list via Ajax calls. Hence that list will have new li whenever. I will therefore need to rebuilt it's sortable plugin. Should I just rebuilt it every time, or should I try to "remove it" first?
[09:24:50] <abisson> if I remark it as sortable, will there be clashes?

[09:39:01] <Palanivel> hello
[09:39:18] <jmar777> need advice: given a plugin that has some absolutely necessary styles, is it a bad idea to programmatically create and insert a style tag from the js?
[09:40:14] <jmar777> ideologically you don't want the css in the js, but practically you don't want to create more work on the developer and potentially another request from the browser...
[09:40:20] <Gho5t> why not use an external file like jquery-ui does
[09:40:59] <jmar777> Gho5t: ya, that's the alternative. although i'll have nowhere near that much css (~20 rules or so)
[09:41:14] <Houman> Hi, i am currently searching for all inputs like this: newElement.find(':input').each(function() ...    But there is one input with an id that is ending in 'chzn' which I would like to exclude? How do i do that please?
[09:42:15] <Gho5t> still a better idea
[09:42:35] <j_ayen_green> Having selected a group of id's by substring, $("[id^='abc']") how do I get the full id in .each() ?
[09:42:44] <Gho5t> doesn't matter how much you have. plus if people want to override them you make it easy to do so
[09:43:13] <Gho5t> $(this).attr('id')
[09:43:35] <j_ayen_green> Gho5t: thanks :)
[09:43:44] <jmar777> Gho5t: aight - thanks for the input

[09:48:57] <ezrafree> what's the best way to find all the divs which are not the closest one?
[09:49:09] <ezrafree> during an onclick event
[09:49:43] <ezrafree> i've been trying to use $(this).not().closest('div.class');
[09:49:57] <mg983> If I want to cache selectors by defining them as variables -- should I do that at the top of my JS file? What is standard procedure to do so?
[09:51:13] <scalability-junk> hey I use the .live('click', function(){}) to bind dynamic created elements to a function. the elements are all under the class 'dynamic'. after the first click is fired the event is not fired again till I moved the mouse out of the parent div and back in again... any suggestion what could go wrong?
[09:51:22] <MistuhKurtz> mg983, just do whatever is most readable to you
[09:52:02] <MistuhKurtz> sometimes people like to init all or a bunch of vars up at the top of the file or a section and then do stuff
[09:52:39] <mg983> so it's not poor form to have a big block of selectors set to variables at the top of a script?
[09:52:47] <mg983> :)
[09:53:21] <whitenoise> xec_, you guys were right.
[09:53:39] <whitenoise> there's a function that the click calls, reloadData(), i was able to isolate each function call and see which one multiplied it.
[09:53:52] <whitenoise> when i did, got that one, then looked in that function, which calls a few other functions, one of which contains two binds for click
[09:54:31] <spyroboy> hello.
[09:54:45] <spyroboy> I'm having an issue retrieving all elements that have the data-key attribute.
[09:54:49] * xec_ is now a level 5 guesser
[09:54:58] <spyroboy> I'm using this: var $keys = $("[data-key]");
[09:55:27] <spyroboy> actually, I'm using var $keys = $page.find("[data-key]");
[09:55:30] <spyroboy> but there's no different.
[09:55:33] <spyroboy> difference*
[09:55:36] <whitenoise> xec_, our "senior dev" wrote it..so says git blame. i seem to spend a lot of time recursively fixing said person's code.
[09:55:39] <spyroboy> any idea why I'm not getting any elements returned?
[09:55:50] <whitenoise> xec_, but, you were a big help :) i didn't know where to look beforehand.
[09:57:07] <xec_> whitenoise: lol, i feel for you. glad you got it sorted :)
[09:57:31] <mg983> MistuhKurtz: if I initiate my caching on DOM ready -- and want a function that leverages these cached objects - I would put the function in the scope of DOM ready?
[09:57:31] <spyroboy> strange. if I do $("[data-key]") .. it works, but if I do $page.find("[data-key]"); it does not.
[09:57:41] <spyroboy> despite the fact that $page contains elements that have the data-key attribute
[09:58:55] <whitenoise> xec, so basically whats happening is: reload is firing, then when it hits the function that calls two more binds, now JS has registered 3 more binds, which will then all fire together per click and will register 2 more each time? is that right?
[09:59:19] <MistuhKurtz> mg983, yes, any code that will be manipulating the DOM should be in the scope of ready...so you pretty much will always put your code in there, unless you're writing a plugin or have some other special use case
[10:00:07] <xec> whitenoise: i couldn't say without seeing the issue first-hand - but my initial guess was more like the first click handler got re-bound each time.
[10:01:27] <xec> whitenoise: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/L5ZZd/
[10:02:32] <wunderCatze> hello
[10:02:41] <wunderCatze> like, someone help me please?
[10:02:50] <xec> ?ask @ wunderCatze
[10:02:51] <bot-t> wunderCatze, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:03:07] <mg983> Thanks MistuhKurtz much respect!
[10:03:23] <MistuhKurtz> np dude!
[10:07:52] <wunderCatze> i've been jquery to build a n,n size matrix, n is a number from keyboad. I done it with .append("<div class='brick'></div>");. Now I am trying to input some text in each div, basically some numbers. I tryied for loops, children().each() and :nth-children but nothing seems to work for ACCESSING AN INDIVIDUAL DIV and put different text in it.
[10:09:08] <wunderCatze> this is the code generating divs: for(var rows = 1; rows <= number; rows++) {
[10:09:08] <wunderCatze> 			for(var cols = 1; cols <= number; cols++) {
[10:09:08] <wunderCatze> 				$("#wrapper").append("<div class='brick'></div>");
[10:09:08] <wunderCatze> 			}
[10:09:08] <wunderCatze> 			wrapperWidth = wrapperWidth + 68;
[10:09:09] <wunderCatze> 			$("#wrapper").css("width", wrapperWidth + "px");
[10:09:09] <wunderCatze> 			$("#wrapper").append("<div style='clear:both'></div>");
[10:09:10] <wunderCatze> 		}

[10:09:54] <arielserafini> don't paste code here!
[10:10:20] <wunderCatze> umh, sorry guys, this is 1th day on this channel, lol
[10:10:23] <wunderCatze> ty
[10:10:30] <arielserafini> wunderCatze, no worries
[10:14:21] <n3ster69> does anyone know off hand if there's a way to detect if the "cancel" button has been pressed on a input:file dialog event?
[10:14:28] <Eviltwin> wunderCatze: http://jsfiddle.net/zNCwh/
[10:18:44] <wunderCatze> uhm, guys... I think I got the biggie. When I pasted in fiddle my code colors gone all crazy and I saw something new, I'm just gonna paste 1 line of code here so I can show you and that's all. I've been using this: $("#wrapper .brick:nth-child(rows).text(rows); and did NOT work until I changed into ...:nth-child(" + rows + ")").text(rows). TY GUYS! THIS IS 1th here :D
[10:19:33] <xec> wunderCatze: did you even check out Eviltwin's awesome solution
[10:19:43] <wunderCatze> thanks eviltwin!
[10:19:44] <wunderCatze> yes
[10:19:55] <xec> do you understand it?
[10:20:17] <wunderCatze> yes
[10:20:34] <wunderCatze> my 'row' variable is interpreted as text and not variable
[10:20:50] <wunderCatze> i had to escaped it with " + row + " so I can do the trick
[10:21:09] <wunderCatze> thats a great example eviltein ty
[10:21:10] <xec> ok cool.
[10:26:11] <berglar> hero, i'm struggling testing an object to see if it is empty
[10:26:23] <berglar> *heyo
[10:26:48] <berglar> i did if ($.isEmptyObject(artChunk)), but I seem to never enter the loop
[10:27:12] <berglar> even though when i print the object I get " [ ] " which to me indicates the object is empty
[10:27:42] <Eviltwin> That indicates the empty array, not the empty object
[10:27:48] <Eviltwin> It probably has a length property
[10:28:02] <berglar> hmm
[10:28:05] <berglar> i will check
[10:28:06] <berglar> thank you
[10:28:18] <Eviltwin> Use for(var k in artChunk) console.log(k, artChunk[k]) to check
[10:31:08] <berglar> thank you; fixed. the "empty" art chunk has length 0
[10:31:11] <clynamen1> is ok to use the child selector to avoid name collision in the same page?
[10:31:12] <berglar> everyone else has length 1
[10:31:31] <Eviltwin> berglar: I'd suggest using a .length == 0 test then
[10:31:35] <Eviltwin> .length === 0
[10:31:45] <berglar> were up that's what i was going to do. thank you!
[10:31:48] <berglar> *word
[10:32:56] <berglar> does an empty string always have length 1? in JS?
[10:33:06] <NoiseEee> :\
[10:34:19] <xec> ?eval "".length
[10:34:22] <bot-t> xec: 0
[10:34:31] <clynamen1> another question: what is the 'this' object in an anonimous function passed to jquery methods like .hover()?
[10:34:33] <xec> berglar: nope :P
[10:34:47] <zzeett> why does typeof Number("2a") return "number"? NaN is a number?
[10:34:59] <NoiseEee> you didn't ask if it was NaN
[10:35:21] <zzeett> no... I asked if Nan the typeof Nan
[10:35:26] <zzeett> s/if//
[10:35:43] <xec> zzeett: yes, NaN is a number
[10:35:44] <NoiseEee> zzeett: you're actually asking what the typeof of the Number is.
[10:35:44] <berglar> alsoooo, if i "return false" in an if that's within an each, that will "break" me out of the loop nest pas?
[10:35:50] <zzeett> eek. I mean ... I asked the Typeof NaN.
[10:35:51] <zzeett> ok
[10:35:58] <zzeett> no i didnt.
[10:36:03] <zzeett> did I?
[10:36:07] <danheberden> ?eval typeof ( 3 / "a" )
[10:36:08] <bot-t> danheberden: "number"
[10:36:12] <danheberden> ?tias
[10:36:13] <bot-t> Try It And See
[10:36:16] <Eviltwin> berglar: Correct
[10:36:38] <zzeett> I did try it and thats why I'm askig for the justification of how typeOf NaN == "number". Seems strange.
[10:36:59] <Eviltwin> Because it behaves like a number
[10:37:18] <zzeett> In what way does it behave like a number?
[10:37:21] <NoiseEee> zzeett: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2801601/why-does-typeof-nan-return-number
[10:37:21] <danheberden> you tried to do a math operation on two things, what do you expect? an array?
[10:37:22] <danheberden> :p
[10:37:43] <zzeett> No I didnt. I did a conversion of a string which doesnt parse to a number,.
[10:37:49] <xec> nobody expects the array type
[10:37:50] <xec> !
[10:37:54] <zzeett> Ill check the link. Thanks.
[10:38:41] <zzeett> yea ok, that covers it well.
[10:38:42] <xec> zzeett: it's simple. NaN means "Not a number" but is a number, but NaN is not NaN
[10:38:55] <danheberden> haha
[10:42:40] <johnkpaul> ?eval isNaN(NaN)
[10:42:41] <bot-t> johnkpaul: true
[10:42:49] <johnkpaul> xec: booyah
[10:43:31] <xec> ?eval var a = Number("a"); a === a;
[10:43:32] <bot-t> xec: false
[10:43:50] <Eviltwin> ?eval 1+2
[10:43:51] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 3
[10:43:54] <Eviltwin> Phew
[10:43:58] <Eviltwin> Finally, a number
[10:44:07] <Eviltwin> I was starting to worry there weren't any
[10:44:10] <xec> hehe
[10:44:30] <johnkpaul> ?eval 0.1 + 0.2
[10:44:31] <bot-t> johnkpaul: 0.30000000000000004
[10:44:53] <johnkpaul> Eviltwin: even the ones that are there don't work right ;)
[10:45:42] <xec> so in conclusion: NaN is NaN but is not equal to itself
[10:46:01] <Eviltwin> It's the only value not equal to itself
[10:46:06] <Eviltwin> Or equal to anything for that matter
[10:56:26] <CydeWeys> Can someone help correct this?  Clearly I'm not doing something right.  Why would blah.children('ul').children('li') work, but blah.children('ul > li') not?  How am I supposed to do it in one selector?
[10:59:00] <abisson> Hey guys… so I have two buttons. I want one of them to be hidden by default, so I added the class "hide" to its. However, when I do "show()" on it, it displays it as display:inline, but the one I just hide was display:inline-block; so the sizes are different. How can I fix that? I don't really want to load the page and then hide them all… isn't that inefficient?
[11:00:10] <danheberden> CydeWeys: because the "li" you want is not a "child" of blah
[11:00:23] <danheberden> blah.find( 'ul > 'li' ) would work though
[11:00:31] <CydeWeys> Ahhh, find.  Cool.
[11:00:51] <danheberden> yeah, children is JUST the immediate children
[11:01:02] <CydeWeys> Is there anything that does all descendants?
[11:01:15] <CydeWeys> Or is that find?
[11:01:50] <CydeWeys> I guess it is find.  Confusing.  There's parent and parents (for ancestors), and then children for direct children, but all descendants is find?  Whatever ... at least now I know.

[11:06:06] <berglar> if I grab the .offset() of two different divs and then set their tops to be equal, shouldn't they be at the same height?
[11:07:35] <johnkpaul> berglar: what is their css position?
[11:07:41] <johnkpaul> if it's static, top doesn't do anything
[11:07:48] <berglar> relative
[11:08:31] <johnkpaul> then it depnds on what the page would have been like if top was 0

[11:49:26] <DoctorMonocular> [Exception: TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) { // The jQuery object is act ...
[11:49:36] <DoctorMonocular> $.toJSON(str) is what I did
[11:50:22] <coffeecup> is there a performance difference or anything else between https://gist.github.com/3795668  ? which method is best practice  ? is it bad to use the 2nd one?
[11:50:37] <wachpwnski> whitenoise:  you are double binding events
[11:51:31] <hazamonzo> So folks. Im trying to do a simple operation with jquery. What i have at the moment works but im not sure its the best way to do it. Here is the jquery. http://pastebin.com/VWSJLj7W To quickly explain, i have a naiigation menu with li's. each li has a class .navLink. When the user  clicks the link, i look up the data-section tag then use it to .show() the div inquestion
[11:51:35] <hazamonzo> *in question
[11:52:01] <hazamonzo> Have a wee look, its really simple and i just want to know if there is a better way to do this. At the moment, it works fine :)
[11:52:33] <hazamonzo> And if you're interested. here is the HTML http://pastebin.com/ScDJq50m
[11:53:54] <PilotBob> hi all... any one have any idea what I can't attach jqueryui autocomplete to an element dynamically added to the DOM
[11:54:51] <DoctorMonocular> how are you trying to attach it PilotBob?
[11:55:20] <PilotBob> $('selector').autocomplete(options);
[11:55:45] <hazamonzo> Silly question really :)
[11:55:57] <whitenoise> wachpwnski, right. I did not write this code, but I need to fix it.
[11:56:11] <whitenoise> well, i wrote the fiddle obviously.
[11:56:14] <whitenoise> the real functions are much larger
[11:56:31] <whitenoise> wachpwnski, but yeah, how do I defeat the n+1 here?
[11:56:41] <whitenoise> without re-writing the entire library
[11:56:49] <wachpwnski> you remove the bind in the reload data
[11:56:59] <Krambiorix> hi , i try to add an image to a div but the image never appears:  $("#loading").html("<img id='loading' src='"+base_url+"img/loading.gif' width='16' height='16'/>"); ->any ideas?
[11:57:02] <wachpwnski> or you unbind and rebind
[11:57:17] <whitenoise> alright
[11:57:22] <whitenoise> let me try unbinding at the end of the process
[11:57:22] <wachpwnski> so like this
[11:57:28] <whitenoise> oh, great, an example!
[11:58:34] <trollboy> so I'm "Faking" a complete table (1 row thead, then each tr inside a <li>) is there a way to force all items in class "foo" to line up?  assuming foo is a col?
[11:59:39] <Eviltwin> You mean dynamically size them?
[11:59:45] <Eviltwin> To barely fit each row
[12:00:07] <wachpwnski> http://jsfiddle.net/DjYqJ/1/ if you just remove it you will be fine
[12:00:12] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: is there a reason that won't work?
[12:00:15] <Krambiorix> anyone?
[12:00:34] <trollboy> Eviltwin, yup
[12:00:41] <DoctorMonocular> yeah PilotBob
[12:00:53] <trollboy> I started off just assigning width to class foo, but that's jenky
[12:01:02] <DoctorMonocular> when you call that what you're saying is: look for anything CURRENTLY ON THE PAGE that matches, and make it autocomplete
[12:01:02] <Eviltwin> ryanneuf_: It's called a <table>
[12:01:04] <Eviltwin> Err
[12:01:10] <Eviltwin> trollboy: It's called a <table>
[12:01:23] <trollboy> EvilTwin, I can't use a standard <table>
[12:01:36] <trumpetmic> Hi.  Is there some jquery floating around to convert a single column <table> into a <ul> list?  Turning each <tr><td>Item</td></tr> into <li>?
[12:01:36] <Eviltwin> Why not?
[12:01:45] <whitenoise> wachpwnski, given the rest of the code, the binds are buried down in some other functions and whatnot, so i think removing it might be a less clean option than just unbinding, but let me try some surgery..
[12:01:56] <DoctorMonocular> if you want to do it for new objects, I think your best bet is to capture the event that adds the dynamic object, and make that object autocomplete as well
[12:02:03] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: so, suggestions on what would work?
[12:02:22] <trollboy> I'm doing a sortable(), each of the data rows is in a <li> nested in a <ul>
[12:02:42] <DoctorMonocular> well, what code adds your new objects to the dom?
[12:03:10] <ryanneuf_> Eviltwin: Thanks :)
[12:03:32] <phiz> are there any browser plugins where you can click an element and it will tell you the most specific selector for it?
[12:03:39] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: I have tried append and appendTo
[12:03:47] <Xgc> trumpetmic: Seems that would be trivial to do.  Just apply some transform to each td under the given table.
[12:03:52] <trollboy> I have like <table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>foo</th></tr></thead></table><ul><li>Stuff <table><tbody><tr><td>55</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul>
[12:03:54] <DoctorMonocular> PilotBob show me the coeew you're working with
[12:03:57] <Krambiorix> hi , i try to add an image to a div but the image never appears:  $("#loading").html("<img id='loading' src='"+base_url+"img/loading.gif' width='16' height='16'/>"); ->any ideas?
[12:04:09] <trollboy> crap got a meeting, sorry, I'llbe back in an hour
[12:05:13] <wachpwnski> whitenoise:  here you go http://jsfiddle.net/DjYqJ/2/
[12:06:23] <Eviltwin> trollboy: http://jsfiddle.net/Wn9VB/
[12:07:10] <NoiseEee> trollboy: but thats totally invalid html
[12:07:16] <NoiseEee> trollboy: if you're goign to use a table... use a table.
[12:07:33] <NoiseEee> oh my bad i read it wrong
[12:07:35] <NoiseEee> eat a steak
[12:07:37] <Eviltwin> I don't know that it's invalid
[12:07:40] <Eviltwin> But it's still awful
[12:07:46] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: the code adding to dom element is in a plugin https://gist.github.com/3795821
[12:07:51] <Eviltwin> This is a million times better: http://jsfiddle.net/Wn9VB/
[12:08:11] <Eviltwin> Holy chaining
[12:08:12] <DoctorMonocular> this gist is plugin code or your code?
[12:08:13] <NoiseEee> word, Eviltwin
[12:08:17] <jedimind> what in the hell was all that <table> stuff about
[12:08:25] <Eviltwin> trollboy doing silly stuff
[12:08:37] <DoctorMonocular> oh, I see, line 34
[12:08:42] <DoctorMonocular> ok, right there
[12:08:50] <DoctorMonocular> do newrow$.autocomplete();
[12:08:50] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: is it my plugin, so my plug in code. Also the code that is in the function which is passed as an option to the plugin.
[12:08:54] <DoctorMonocular> right after that line
[12:10:09] <Krambiorix> hi , i try to add an image to a div but the image never appears:  $("#loading").html("<img id='loading' src='"+base_url+"img/loading.gif' width='16' height='16'/>"); ->any ideas?
[12:10:23] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: you mean after I attach the autocomplete to the input box?
[12:10:42] <PilotBob> or you mean before I attach it?
[12:10:46] <norm> Krambiorix: your img has the same id as your container
[12:12:13] <Krambiorix> norm still i dont see it
[12:12:15] <DoctorMonocular> PilotBob $(this) is the input, right?
[12:12:27] <DoctorMonocular> so do $(this).autocomplete(...)
[12:12:37] <DoctorMonocular> that's all
[12:12:39] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: on what line?
[12:13:14] <norm> does your browser show that it got inserted? i.e. chrome developer tools
[12:14:08] <Krambiorix> norm i have firebug?
[12:14:25] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: so nothing more than calling autocomplete on the new input element?
[12:14:28] <norm> Krambiorix: pl
[12:14:34] <norm> Krambiorix: err, ok
[12:14:50] <Biomech> damnit kram, you need to change your name :P
[12:14:58] <Krambiorix> ??
[12:15:05] <DoctorMonocular> PilotBob, exactly right, since it wasn't around for the first call to autocomplete, you're just calling it now
[12:15:21] <Biomech> i have my irc client set to play a sound whenever someone says "Bio*" so i know if people want me when Im afk :p
[12:15:27] <Krambiorix> lol
[12:15:28] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: that's basically what I'm doing, but it doesn't seem to work.
[12:15:36] <Krambiorix> bio
[12:15:40] <Biomech> lol yeah like that :P
[12:15:41] <Krambiorix> bio
[12:15:43] <Krambiorix>  bio
[12:15:47] <Krambiorix> bio
[12:15:48] <Krambiorix> bio
[12:15:59] <Biomech> its not so bad now, because im going for dinner and then the other side of the house :P
[12:16:57] <Krambiorix> lol
[12:17:46] <Krambiorix> norm, i have FF developer tools
[12:18:05] <Krambiorix> and i can show the img path, but for this image there's no path shown
[12:18:28] <norm> start by adding an img with a static src
[12:19:35] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: calling auto complete on the newly added element doesn't work. I'll have to see if I can get a js fiddle sample of what I am doing.
[12:20:15] <DoctorMonocular> PilotBob some plugins need the object to actually be in the dom before you call it
[12:20:31] <DoctorMonocular> also, make sure you're calling it on the input object itself and not like a parent object or something
[12:23:24] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: you see line 42... that is the same line of code called for the existing rows which works fine. Just calling that once I have dynamic rows doesn't work.
[12:23:46] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: I even tried to do a destory first then call it, the pre-existing elements it works for... but not the added ones.
[12:24:57] <DoctorMonocular> what happens if you step into the autocomplete call?
[12:32:33] <Krambiorix> norm, static src doesn't work too
[12:45:05] <Toasty> Question for you: $('#certs').innerHTML = data;
[12:45:15] <Toasty> what would be the right way to do that
[12:45:24] <Toasty> replace the innerHTML of certs with data
[12:45:34] <Eviltwin> No
[12:45:43] <Eviltwin> Not with jQuery
[12:45:46] <Eviltwin> see ?html
[12:45:48] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:46:26] <Toasty> heck yea, that's what I was looking for
[12:46:31] <Toasty> Thanks Eviltwin
[12:46:51] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: I haven't tried stepping into the call. Good idea though. I was working with a junior dev on this over web ex. Gotta get it set up on my PC to drill into it.
[12:48:19] <green-_> anyone familiar with jquery DataTables? i'm searching here for a way to select invidual or multiple cells, but can't find it. Row/column selection is there, but no cell selection. I find it hard to believe that wouldn't be supported, so I'm assuming I'm missing something.
[12:48:59] <philthetechie> hey whats up room. Got an Open question. Willing to hear any suggestions.
[12:49:07] <philthetechie> Looking to animate 100+ image based hyperlinks randomly on a page
[12:49:22] <philthetechie> thoughts: Canvas + overlaid Divs for hpyerlink - Buggy to get div to follow canvas, canvas collisions != div collision.
[12:49:29] <philthetechie> animated divs - jquery. 100+? Ridiculous on IE.
[12:49:36] <philthetechie> Flash? get over it.
[12:49:46] <philthetechie> So don;t know where to take it
[12:50:18] <philthetechie> Anyone considered the problem before?
[12:50:24] <iSeeDeadPixels> is there a jQuery function to "flip" a div?
[12:50:49] <iSeeDeadPixels> like turning it 180 degrees
[12:50:56] <iSeeDeadPixels> so you see the back side of said div
[12:52:01] <ajpiano> iSeeDeadPixels: http://lab.smashup.it/flip/
[12:52:08] <FiLeVeR10> webkit can do that with css
[12:52:30] <philthetechie> webkit can rotate
[12:52:41] <philthetechie> but flip like mirror image of contents??
[12:53:01] <FiLeVeR10> yea
[12:53:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> nah, just like a card, flipping it
[12:53:14] <Gho5t> is it necessary to check if an element exists before doing jQuery manipulations?
[12:53:28] <iSeeDeadPixels> and not like your link ajpiano
[12:53:34] <FiLeVeR10> http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/webkit-flip/demo/index.html
[12:53:52] <iSeeDeadPixels> i wish it was linear :C
[12:53:54] <wachpwnski> are you serious? jquery does a sortable?
[12:54:02] <wachpwnski> .sortable() !?
[12:54:16] <iSeeDeadPixels> FiLeVeR10 yeahhhh that!
[12:55:33] <FiLeVeR10> http://css3playground.com/flip-card.php
[12:55:38] <philthetechie> guys - - nothing on the performance issues around animating 100 12x12px div/images?
[12:56:30] <FiLeVeR10> put them in a sprite and uss them as background images
[12:56:51] <philthetechie> they need to be hyperlinks or mousedown events
[12:56:57] <philthetechie> individaually
[12:57:27] <FiLeVeR10> doesn't change anything, put them in a sprite and use background-position
[12:57:33] <philthetechie> thats the proble,m otherwise i'd just canvas it
[12:58:15] <philthetechie> cool i'll take a look at that
[12:59:09] <FiLeVeR10> philthetechie: have an example?
[13:00:43] <philthetechie> not down on code yet. I'm looking at 100 random search results individually bouncing around a 50px * pagewidth div
[13:01:03] <philthetechie> each result will be a 12x12 px box animated in color and posiution
[13:01:14] <philthetechie> as a link
[13:01:16] <trumpetmic> Is there a snippet of jQuery out there that can convert a single-column table to a list?  Here's my example markup with the current code and an example of what I'm after: http://pastie.org/4831417
[13:01:17] <philthetechie> no text
[13:02:12] <philthetechie> trumpetmic http://stackoverflow.com/questions/577669/how-to-transform-html-table-to-list-with-jquery
[13:02:22] <DrJ> can anyone have a look at this: http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/progress.html ... it works great in the almighty firefox but the progress bar does not work in IE
[13:02:56] <FiLeVeR10> philthetechie: that's easy, just do a each on the tds you want to get info from and rewrite them into a list and remove the table
[13:03:40] <philthetechie> lol i was answering trumpetmics question
[13:04:07] <jedimind> trumpetmic, can probably be acheived by writing like 5-10 lines of jquery
[13:04:19] <jedimind> but there probably isnt an existing snippet that you can use out of the box
[13:04:26] <jedimind> that would be applicable specifically to your markup
[13:05:01] <FiLeVeR10> $('td').each(function() { var ct = $(this).html(); $('#somelist').append('<li>'+ct+'</li>'); });
[13:05:27] <trumpetmic> thanks philthetechie, DrJ, and jedimind.  The snippet philthetechie seems like it might be a good starting point/shortcut.
[13:05:40] <philthetechie> DrJ: Still not hitting 100% in FF - locked at 84% when completed
[13:06:13] <trumpetmic> FiLeVeR10: that's also a very interesting approach!  thanksk
[13:06:15] <DrJ> it hits 100% for me
[13:06:30] <DrJ> in Internet exploder though it just sits at 0
[13:06:49] <wachpwnski> it hits 100% for me on chrome
[13:07:09] <trumpetmic> FiLeVeR10: so that would assume the list I wanted was on the page already?
[13:07:24] <trumpetmic> and it would pull the table rows in as li?
[13:07:53] <philthetechie> DrJ http://pbarton.co.uk/pixel/ul.jpg
[13:09:57] <FiLeVeR10> DrJ: looks like lots of people have issues with that plugin. If you write the percentage to a file with php, then you can use ajax to reload that file at an interval to update the bar
[13:10:18] <DrJ> what the form plugin?
[13:10:32] <FiLeVeR10> just the progress part
[13:10:38] <DrJ> ah
[13:11:14] <Cameron_> how do i use $(document).ready with openstreetmaps?
[13:11:19] <Cameron_> if i define an onload in the html it works#
[13:11:40] <FiLeVeR10> DrJ: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[13:11:59] <Eviltwin> Cameron_: Use $(window).load instead of $(document).ready
[13:12:21] <Cameron_> doesnt work eviltwin
[13:12:51] <Eviltwin> Then you broke something else
[13:13:32] <FiLeVeR10> DrJ: this may be why http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10221172/jquery-form-plugin-uploadprogress-not-called-in-ie8-ie9
[13:16:02] <DrJ> ah, so there is no getting that one to work in IE then
[13:19:00] <philthetechie> FiLeVeR10: Sprites dude. Cheers.
[13:25:31] <Krambiorix> when starting a function i show a loading image. At the end of the function i hide it. The problem is that the image is never shown.... If i remove the code that hides it, the image is shown... I presume that the image is shown for a microsecond, so i can't see it... What can be the problem?
[13:29:44] <jvm_> hi. so i copied from the api documentation example $.ajax({..}).done(function (response) { .. }); and chrome tells me XMLHttpRequest has no method 'done'. what's wrong?

[13:58:07] <Whirl3d> I have read so many articles about them just to find the article is out of date...
[13:58:53] <jedimind> i just answered in #css Whirl3d
[13:59:03] <jedimind> but it basically went someting like "blah blah blah, google it"
[14:47:38] <phiz> hmm i have a button that doesn't work in IE unless I have developer mode (F12) open
[14:47:46] <phiz> works fine in all of the other browsers...anyone ever seen that before?
[14:48:21] <phiz> very strange
[14:48:53] <kam187-rMBP> hi guys
[14:48:55] <phiz> and if i close developer tools it still works
[14:49:52] <kam187-rMBP> in a multi page file, how do i transition to page two in JS ?
[14:51:53] <defaultro_> good afternoon folks. Need your help badly. I have a form that displays textboxes. The command that will hide the textfields is $('.editFields').hide();   However, on our js file, I don't know where to insert it because when I was firebugging it, the textboxes hasn't been displayed yet. Unfortunately, the form opens with textboxes enabled.
[14:52:10] <defaultro_> i tried $(document).ready but it didn't work
[14:53:01] <defaultro_> I might be confusing. Here it is again. I want to open the form with textboxes hidden
[14:53:54] <defaultro_> i need to figure out how to check if textboxes have already been displayed. When they're displayed, hide them
[14:54:42] <defaultro_> anyone has a solution?
[15:02:09] <DeniseM> Hey all.  I have a form that submits via AJAX and that returns a replaceWith to replace a table on the page with different information.  I have verified that the AJAX query happens and returns the proper javascript, but then the javascript doesn't actually fire and replace the table.  I'm using $("#table_name").replaceWith("NEW STUFF");
[15:02:40] <DeniseM> Is there something wrong with my syntax?  Is there a reason why the javascript isn't firing after returning from the AJAX call?
[15:02:46] <wunderCatze> if $(".editFields").is(":visible") { $(".editFields").hide(); }
[15:03:33] <DeniseM> Even replacing the .replaceWith with an alert("blah") doesn't seem to be firing
[15:03:57] <tqrst> is there a way to make jquery decide between GET and POST for an ajax request, based on the domain? (i.e. use GET+JSONP if doing POST would result in a cross-domain request)
[15:04:37] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: Ok... here is a fiddle that shows the issue. http://jsfiddle.net/AqShS/6/
[15:04:49] <tqrst> (I'm writing something that needs to talk to two servers, which will sometimes be deployed on the same machine but not always)
[15:05:09] <DeniseM> tqrst: I think you're going to run into the cross domain spoofing stuff
[15:05:14] <PilotBob> DoctorMonocular: assuming you are still around. notice th rows dynamically added the auto complete doesn't work on?
[15:05:51] <tqrst> DeniseM: cross domain spoofing?
[15:06:34] <PilotBob> If anyone has any ideas why the auto complete doesn't work on the dynamically added rows. Rows are added by just typing values into the input boxes in the table... I'd appreciate the help. http://jsfiddle.net/AqShS/6/
[15:11:32] <biberao> hi
[15:12:16] <shoky> PilotBob: you're cloning a row that already has an autocomplete
[15:12:46] <shoky> PilotBob: here's one way.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/AqShS/7/
[15:13:14] <defaultro_> I want to remove all class with class of editfields. I tried this but it's not working, $(".editFields").removaclass();
[15:13:24] <PilotBob> shoky: ok? I've tried several things to get this to work. What am I missing.
[15:13:29] <shoky> PilotBob: you were cloning a row that already has autocomplete, and then you were calling .autocomplete(...) again on ALL middle inputs
[15:13:50] <shoky> PilotBob: i updated your fiddle showing a possible solution
[15:14:09] <defaultro_> sorry, removeclass but still didn't work
[15:14:23] <shoky> PilotBob: i "destroyed" the current autocomplete before cloning
[15:15:32] <defaultro_> anyone or is it not possible with Jquery?
[15:16:49] <PilotBob> shoky: nice... I had tried to destroy it in my onRowCloned but that didn't seem to work.
[15:17:30] <DeniseM> defaultro_: $(".editFields").remove();
[15:18:09] <defaultro_> cool, i'll try
[15:18:55] <defaultro_> Awesome! It worked :D
[15:22:17] <PilotBob> shoky: interesting. So, how come what you did works, but this doesn't? http://jsfiddle.net/PilotBob/AqShS/8/
[15:23:24] <phiz> anyone know why this would work only after opening developer toolbar in IE9 https://pastee.org/j2daj
[15:23:29] <phiz> it works in chrome fine
[15:25:01] <phiz> and it works in IE9 *after* going into F12 developer tools
[15:26:04] <ngharo> maybe console object is not available in IE without the dev tools open
[15:26:27] <ngharo> remove the console.log line and try again
[15:26:36] <phiz> hmm that is it, thanks
[15:26:56] <phiz> you saved me some grey hairs there
[15:27:14] <phiz> it's unfortunate that IE doesn't just ignore thtat
[15:27:16] <phiz> -t
[15:30:48] <ngharo> you can code around it.  window.console && console.log()
[15:32:19] <Eviltwin> Or window.console || (window.console = { log: function() {} });
[15:45:17] <devatwork> Hey guys, im using jquerymobile. I am having issues trying to get the elements to space out evenly. Lots of whitespace left at the bottom
[15:45:38] <devatwork> Any way to consume the free space and spread the components ?
[15:47:21] <Pasq89> any idea why selecting a # (id) for a button isnt working?
[15:48:29] <tareco> hi all, this is an off-topic question but just wondering if 40k per year is a good salary in germany ?
[15:48:29] <razzi> Pasq89 you got link?
[15:48:32] <Zzaichik> Pasq89: you will need to supply  …oh so much more info
[15:49:11] <Pasq89> i will try it a little more.. if my patience runs out, i will post info!
[15:49:45] <devatwork> i can put <br />'s everywhere...but thats fixed :(
[15:49:54] <Zzaichik> ^^ awesome
[15:49:56] <Zzaichik> lol
[15:53:04] <Pasq89> i was messing up using its class... :/ fixed!
[15:53:51] <defaultro_> DeniseM, I need help again
[15:55:18] <phiz> are there any browser plugins where you can click an element and it will tell you the most specific selector for it?
[15:55:28] <paul_irish_> there is one
[15:55:29] <paul_irish_> but
[15:55:35] <paul_irish_> the best one is your brain
[15:55:35] <phiz> or is inspect element w/ chrome the easiest
[15:55:43] <paul_irish_> yes
[15:55:52] <phiz> yeah, sometimes i need an extra set of eyes because my brain is malfunctioning :-P
[15:55:56] <defaultro_> DeniseM, this code only works in my console, It works because the form has completely loaded all the textfields. During runtime, it doesn't work because the form hasn't completely loaded. How can I make sure it's completely loaded before that code gets executed? http://pastebin.com/F4V9t5xk
[15:56:09] <grantgalitz> ಠ_ಠ
[15:56:13] <paul_irish_> authoring selectors is hard because you have to know how else the DOM will grow
[15:56:19] <paul_irish_> grantgalitz: lol whatcha doin here
[15:56:37] <paul_irish_> hows big life now that your work is in Octane
[15:56:50] <grantgalitz> paul_irish_: Apple Maps led me here. It is not a clever app.
[15:56:56] <grantgalitz> paul_irish_: wat
[15:56:57] <paul_irish_> a gaggle of fans following you around
[15:57:03] <grantgalitz> Not really. :P
[15:57:06] <tw2113> what are both of you doing here
[15:57:09] <paul_irish_> people buying your underwear on ebay
[15:57:14] <grantgalitz> Most people pissed I took down the game center.
[15:57:24] <paul_irish_> whyd it go down
[15:57:26] <tw2113> they can git clone
[15:57:42] <grantgalitz> paul_irish_: Let me link you http://cdn.grantgalitz.org/DMCA.pdf
[15:57:49] <grantgalitz> yeah
[15:58:09] <paul_irish_> diiiiiiiicks
[15:58:16] <grantgalitz> guess what
[15:58:23] <defaultro_> or can anyone please shed some light on form not being completely loaded the textboxes?
[15:58:25] <grantgalitz> it was the IPHONE version they specifically mentioned
[15:58:30] <paul_irish_> wat
[15:58:32] <grantgalitz> not the main site
[15:58:39] <grantgalitz> yeah
[15:58:46] <paul_irish_> bunch of geniuses
[15:59:23] <grantgalitz> so now the game center uses the standard official emulator I have on github
[15:59:36] <grantgalitz> where you load in yur own
[15:59:39] <paul_irish_> ah
[15:59:56] <grantgalitz> so the game center now IS in fact the copy found on github.
[16:00:09] <grantgalitz> before it was a modified copy
[16:00:14] <grantgalitz> with preloads
[16:00:28] <Whirl3d> defaultro, did you get your answer?
[16:00:41] <defaultro_> Whirl3d, no
[16:01:03] <grantgalitz> paul_irish_: cute of the octane team to embed the entire test rom inside the benchmark code itself
[16:01:03] <Whirl3d> perhaps you can hide the parent container until loaded and then you are at liberty to check the text boxes as they load?
[16:01:12] <defaultro_> this is the code I want to run but fails since form hasn't loaded the textboxes completely yet, http://pastebin.com/F4V9t5xk
[16:01:20] <grantgalitz> paul_irish_: last line of the benchmark has it encoded in base64
[16:01:23] <grantgalitz> ^_^
[16:01:34] <defaultro_> it does satisfy the condition but there is nothing to hide and show since form is still blank
[16:01:56] <Whirl3d> do you have an event that happens once the form is completely loaded?
[16:02:05] <defaultro_> no
[16:02:21] <defaultro_> that's what I need but don't know how to do it
[16:02:40] <defaultro_> $(document).ready() didn't work :D
[16:02:58] <Whirl3d> Then perhaps you could do this: after your form, in the markup, place a <script>processForm()</script> tag that calls the predefined processForm() function.
[16:03:18] <defaultro_> I got lost there
[16:03:24] <Whirl3d> then in your header, define a processForm() frunction that hides the fields you want, THEN displays the parent container.
[16:03:41] <defaultro_> i'm going to read your suggestion again
[16:03:43] <defaultro_> :)
[16:03:44] <grantgalitz> paul_irish_: also the code the octane benchmark is using is really out of date
[16:03:59] <grantgalitz> That's how I can tell they spent half a year on octane
[16:04:08] <paul_irish_> ah
[16:04:16] <paul_irish_> hae you been in touch with them
[16:04:18] <paul_irish_> they should update
[16:04:32] <grantgalitz> I tried, but they want the test to not change
[16:04:36] <grantgalitz> as it would change perf
[16:04:43] <defaultro_> Whirl3d: so add this -> <script>processForm()</script>  to the js file that displays the form?
[16:04:45] <grantgalitz> as there have been optimizations in the js code since their copy
[16:05:07] <grantgalitz> which would invalidate comparisons in scoring for before/after comparisons
[16:05:13] <sixtwo> I have a question, im pretty new to jquery, where would i look if i wanted to create something to show that there is a active connection to the server?
[16:05:17] <grantgalitz> between the octane updates
[16:06:13] <paul_irish_> gotcha
[16:06:18] <Whirl3d> Think of it like this: if you have a <script> tag in the middle of your html document, it runs as soon as the dom loads it. So, by telling the browser to configure your form inline <script> fixForm()</script> it will have to wait until the form is loaded
[16:06:39] <grantgalitz> TL;DR benchmark scoring reliability reasons
[16:06:44] <grantgalitz> valid
[16:06:54] <Whirl3d> then in your display form scripts, adjust the fields to show the ones you want/hide the others.
[16:07:19] <defaultro_> k
[16:07:33] <grantgalitz> paul_irish_: Apparently no one has noticed work on the GBA emulator, although I haven't worked on it in a month
[16:08:08] <grantgalitz> paul_irish_: https://github.com/grantgalitz/IodineGBA/tree/master/IodineGBA
[16:08:18] <grantgalitz> It's the successor to the gbc emu
[16:09:02] <Whirl3d> Make sure when you initially load the form, you set opacity to 0, but not display:none. that way the rest of your page formats correctly and you have a blank "reserved" spot for your form. Then your display form script resets opacity to 1
[16:09:19] <paul_irish_> hot
[16:09:32] <defaultro_> k
[16:10:06] <defaultro_> thanks! I'll try it
[16:14:53] <Whirl3d> do columns work? LOL I was just looking for a solution for adapting extra-wide textboxes to use multicolumns and came across http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#introduction how can I tell which browsers support this?
[16:19:05] <aaas> Hello I can use mysql 'outfile' to generate a csv of a table on the fly, I also can use php to make the request.  Is there a way to use jquery to initialize this with some 'click' event? Basically I'd like to just click an image and the entire process starts.
[16:20:10] <BG> is there a jquery method to generate json from element values, like .serializeArray() but with true json as result?
[16:20:10] <razzi> aaas, look into .ajax()
[16:20:21] <aaas> razzi thanks
[16:22:16] <razzi> bg, http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/
[16:24:29] <BG> thanks razzi, so I understand there is no official built in solution?
[16:24:37] <aaas> razzi sorry one more thing...I'd like to be able to download the csv not just start the process, say mysql saves the csv somewwhere,  how can I get jquery to serve this file, is it even possible?
[16:26:40] <razzi> aaas, if your case you don't need js, just make the image a link to your php script that outputs the file with correct headers
[16:27:29] <aaas> razzi ah so don't use mysql 'outfile', just manually build the csv?
[16:28:04] <aaas> razzi and as long as the headers are correct the browser will try and download the file?
[16:31:19] <DeniseM> yes aaas
[16:31:41] <aaas> DeniseM razzi thanks....i was making it far more complicated then it needed to be
[16:32:23] <DeniseM> you'll have to have php write the csv file out somewhere that will be able to be served by apache (ie /public directory in your website)
[16:35:06] <Lucky--> is it utorrent or microtorrent? *random question of the day*
[16:53:09] <bung> can someone explain to me why this returns 1 and not 2 ? http://jsfiddle.net/LpFat/
[16:55:48] <chare> https://gist.github.com/3797170
[16:55:51] <chare> why doesn't that work
[16:56:17] <bika> test
[16:58:53] <bung> i got it, its selecting one cell out of all 4
[16:58:55] <bung> cool.
[16:59:49] <razzi> bung, also i think you needed index = 1
[17:00:34] <giuliogiuseppega> hi all
[17:00:39] <giuliogiuseppega> i have a simple question
[17:00:50] <tw2113> *waits for it*
[17:00:56] <giuliogiuseppega> how to scroll in a dive clicking another object?
[17:01:33] <razzi> bung, http://jsfiddle.net/cNxPg/
[17:01:35] <giuliogiuseppega> is there a function? or should i use some css tricks?
[17:07:30] <Pasq89> how can i set events for newly created items? eg i have a toggle button , that shows and hides some elements.. (input fields) .. i want those feilds to act on keydown event!
[17:08:23] <bung> razzi: ah yes forgot about nth child, thanks
[17:08:27] <razzi> Pasq89, .live()
[17:09:04] <jordotech> howdy, can someone tell me why this is being interpreted as text/xml?  http://pastebin.com/FRXJY1et
[17:09:22] <jordotech> I've tried setting headers, mimeType, contentType, beforeSend
[17:09:42] <Pasq89> thank you razzi .. googling it!
[17:12:16] <Pasq89> jquery rocks! :)
[17:19:38] <bartmax> im doing in an ajax request on the error the following:                     error: function(xhr) {
[17:19:38] <bartmax>                         console.log('msg', xhr.responseText);
[17:19:38] <bartmax>                     }
[17:19:58] <bartmax> but i expect json in responseText ... is there anyway to set that ?
[17:20:03] <bartmax> in the xhr error response
[17:20:04] <bartmax> ?
[17:20:10] <bartmax> or should I parse it manually
[17:20:24] <bartmax> or is bad practice ?
[17:21:29] <montage> Why are the U.S. major traditional media not covering Presidential Candidates Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, Virgil Goode and Rocky Anderson?
[17:22:34] <montage> I find that very puzzling since the USA touts itself as a shining beacon of democracy
[17:23:28] <montage> Why are the US major traditional media acting like they are censoring some Presidential Candidates?
[17:24:30] <tw2113> awesome questions that i lack great answers for
[17:24:50] <montage> thanks for the compliment though :)
[17:25:17] <tw2113> i wish at least Gary was included more
[17:26:13] <montage> I just find it puzzling that for a country that touts itself as a shing beacon of democracy, the major traditional media are acting like some third-word repressive regime
[17:26:26] <tw2113> welcome to our lie
[17:48:12] <Pasq89> is there a way to add custom function to this?
[17:48:53] <Pasq89> i want to put this on a .live function : http://pastebin.com/dnb7BG1h
[17:49:40] <montage> Good Day to you tw2113
[17:50:15] <coldhead> Pasq89: you mean you want to add autocomplete to input which you add to the page later?
[17:50:32] <Pasq89> exaclty!
[17:50:54] <bartmax_> Pasq89: not as trivial as it should
[17:51:03] <Pasq89> sounds... strange right?
[17:51:14] <bartmax_> Pasq89: actually, it does not...
[17:51:15] <coldhead> Pasq89: you have to call autocomplete() for the new elements as you add them
[17:51:40] <Pasq89> that i was going to say... call it right after i add them!
[17:52:56] <bartmax_> you can do $(document).ajaxSuccess(function (event, xhr, settings) { // check if incoming data have for example a .autocomplete class and apply to all ajaxSuccess function but this will only work for ajax request.
[17:54:42] <bartmax_> problem is you should probabilly not want that, because in real life scenarios, autocompletes should be different
[17:54:59] <Pasq89> basically, i replaceWith some elements... and after that i use .autocomplete... seems not to work for now..
[17:56:11] <bartmax_> ? replaceWith
[17:56:12] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[17:56:52] <bartmax_> must work
[17:56:56] <Pasq89> thats write bartmax_ !
[17:57:00] <Pasq89> emm wait..
[17:57:22] <Pasq89> still dont figured out..
[18:01:23] <Pasq89> worked! :)
[18:10:37] <riku> does anyone know if its possibly to open url in to a new tab with javascript or jQuery? I'd like to create a preview system like in wordpress that when you click the preview button it opens up the preview page in a new tab
[18:15:39] <bartmax_> riku: target="_blank"
[18:16:05] <riku> window.open(url, "_blank");
[18:16:10] <riku> this is what i'm trying to do
[18:16:20] <riku> unfortunately it tries to open it in a new window
[18:16:27] <riku> and some browsers are blocking it
[18:16:41] <riku> so it could be a bit confising for the users
[18:16:46] <riku> *confusing
[18:18:13] <bartmax_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4907843/open-url-in-new-tab-using-javascript
[18:18:20] <bartmax_> riku: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4907843/open-url-in-new-tab-using-javascript
[18:19:14] <riku> well I tried the one with 28 votes
[18:19:23] <riku> but it's still opening it in a new window
[18:20:57] <riku> well maybe it cannot be done.. ill just a link to the preview page then
[18:23:00] <bartmax_> riku: you may want to read the whole thread to understand why it does and does not work
[18:23:46] <riku> yep I read it already, thanks for the help anyways
[18:29:14] <Pasq89> i m using this (calling a function when autocompleted chosen!) and doesnt work!! : http://pastebin.com/ifxUpeuJ
[18:54:48] <BrandonC> hey all.. if i have http://pastebin.com/b6hzM2Cw   how can i call the function inline and assign the url: inline?
[18:58:23] <madprops> if i do an each loop inside another each loop, when im in the innermost loop if i use $(this) which element am i referring to?
[19:01:42] <kborchers> madprops: it would be the current element of the inner each
[19:03:02] <Pasq89> function after autocomplete chosen is never called! :/ -> http://pastebin.com/ifxUpeuJ
[19:05:46] <dibs> Hey everyone. How can I detect if a div has changed?
[19:05:48] <kborchers> Pasq89: what autocomplete is that? doesn't look like jQuery UI
[19:06:23] <jrockjiggz> dibs: you cannot
[19:06:36] <Pasq89> its this one: http://beski.wordpress.com/2009/11/20/jquery-php-mysql-ajax-autocomplete/
[19:06:38] <dibs> Sorry. Detect if the content of a div has changed?
[19:07:11] <jrockjiggz> dibs: its not very straightforward, and probably very expensive with a lot of overhead -- what is your issue you are facing?
[19:08:48] <dibs> jrockjiggz: I have a file upload area that uses ajax to upload an image, it then replaces the file field with some output, I need to detect when this happens.
[19:09:20] <madprops> if i issue an each loop and inside it i remove an element of it that hasn't been iterated, will it skip it or still show it?
[19:09:23] <jrockjiggz> dibs: use trigger when you update the field value
[19:09:58] <kborchers> Pasq89: any reason you're using that outdated autocomplete and not the UI version?
[19:10:23] <jrockjiggz> dibs: $('div#hiddenField').bind('updated, function(){ alert('nice'); });
[19:10:36] <jrockjiggz> inside your ajax success: $('#id').value(newValue);  $('div#hiddenField').trigger('updated');
[19:11:03] <Pasq89> was first goog result!
[19:11:22] <Pasq89> "jquery autocomplete php ".. :P
[19:11:41] <kborchers> Pasq89: well that one was merged into UI 2 years ago and has been much improved
[19:12:26] <dibs> jrockjiggz: I was hopinh to not touch the ajax code as it's not my script. Do you know if I can detect ajax requests made by other scripts?
[19:13:04] <Pasq89> where i can find an example as simple as that, in the newest version?
[19:13:27] <kborchers> ?ui.autocomplete @ Pasq89
[19:13:29] <bot-t> Pasq89, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[19:14:15] <kborchers> Pasq89: if you only need autocomplete go here http://jqueryui.com/download then click "Deselect all components", then scroll down and only click the box for autocomplete. it will select autocomplete and it's dependencies, and you can select a theme and download
[19:14:37] <dibs> jrockjiggz: thanks for your help. I'm using $(document).ajaxSuccess(function(){}); to intercept.
[19:14:45] <Pasq89> thanks a LOT!
[19:14:50] <kborchers> np
[19:15:25] <Pasq89> btw , i m using 1.8 jquery from google... isnt included there?
[19:15:26] <jrockjiggz> dibs: I see.. i would recommend finding a way, does ajaxSuccess work for you?
[19:16:40] <dibs> jrockjiggz: I am using it to hook off of then look for the new content.
[19:17:17] <kborchers> Pasq89: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.23/jquery-ui.min.js but that is all of UI and no theme so you'll need to go get a theme
[19:18:21] <Pasq89> thats what i m using... but /1.8/ .. okay... thank you! :)
[19:18:53] <kborchers> Pasq89: no that's ui not jquery … you need both
[19:20:00] <Pasq89> i understand.. thank you.. btw i use jqgrid.. and i build my custom theme.. and i chose everything.. with themeroller.. thats the same, right? (gqrid is on top of jquery)
[19:21:18] <kborchers> Pasq89: hmmm, you get your theme from jqueryui.com?
[19:22:02] <Pasq89> not.. from here.. http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ its jquery :P
[19:22:49] <kborchers> if your theme came from there, then yes, that should work
[19:23:19] <Pasq89> :)
[19:25:12] <Pasq89> its 5:25 am...
[19:25:19] <Pasq89> goodnight, and thank you all!
[19:35:52] <abisson> hey guys! I am trying to do an ajax query to my REST api from Jquery… but I always get a 500 error saying JSON object could not be decoded. http://jsfiddle.net/HBtJH/ Any ideas?
[19:37:38] <coldhead> you don't seem to be JSON encoding your data
[19:38:14] <coldhead> data: JSON.stringify(newData) ?
[19:39:56] <abisson> … *facepalm* … I thought it would do it if we passed it a dict?
[19:42:57] <bontaq> hihi guys, have a little question.  I'm trying to get the text value of an <h1> that is contained within this: var busName = $(bus).text();
[19:43:07] <bontaq> Well, within "bus" specifically
[19:43:58] <bontaq> And "bus" is an ( this ) that I pass in from another function
[19:44:37] <jrockjiggz> bontaq: what is the value?
[19:46:35] <shoky> $(bus).find('h1').text() ?
[19:47:47] <bontaq> aaa! it works!
[19:47:58] <bontaq> shoky: thanks a ton :D

[21:01:39] <martisj> does the hover event have two different states?
[21:01:49] <martisj> onmouseout and onmouseover?
[21:05:47] <badbandit> hey there, I have some code that works fine on my development server, but when I pushed it live it's not working! Basically I made a small bit of code that calculates the longest "product box" and then sets the height of all product boxes to that height, thus keeping an even size w/o setting heights in css
[21:05:49] <badbandit> http://www.emergencysupplysolutions.com/products/automotive/automotive-kits/
[21:05:58] <badbandit> http://dpaste.com/807117/
[21:06:33] <badbandit> Im thinking that maybe it's being run before all of the products have loaded and so too soon to do the calc? I have it bundled in a $(document).ready
[21:07:02] <badbandit> how could I check to make sure all the boxes have loaded first, or run it after theyve loaded
[21:14:55] <badbandit> are there any experts awake in here?
[21:20:39] <blendedbychris> any idea if i can somehow "scoll" something that is overflow auto
[21:22:59] <jrockjiggz> blendedbychris: overflow: scroll ?
[21:24:01] <blendedbychris> well i am actually trying to scroll it based on a button press
[21:24:13] <blendedbychris> i think you set scrollTop() it looks like
[21:24:26] <jrockjiggz> ?scrollTo
[21:24:27] <bot-t> jrockjiggz, ScrollTo - jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[21:28:42] <martisj> should i be using on instead of bind and the other convennience methods like hover(), mouseout(), etc.?
[21:29:55] <goddard> how can i make an onchange function that I can attach to what ever select box i want
[21:29:57] <coldhead> the convenience methods aren't deprecated, so they should still be good. they'll use on() internally
[21:30:09] <coldhead> but on should replace bind() and live() and delegate()
[21:30:47] <goddard> or how do i make a function with jquery
[21:30:52] <goddard> i know how to do it with normal javascript
[21:31:16] <coldhead> goddard: $('select').on('change', ur_fn_name_here);
[21:31:30] <goddard> ahh ok
[21:32:03] <goddard> is there a better way rather then embeding it in my htmls onchange="" ?
[21:32:18] <goddard> i have multiple select boxes that use ajax and are generated dynamicly with php
[21:32:28] <goddard> they are all the same
[21:33:19] <coldhead> ?on @ goddard
[21:33:20] <bot-t> goddard, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:33:38] <coldhead> if you use delegation you can make your code bind to all new <select>s whenever they are added
[21:33:49] <coldhead> never ever use onchange=""
[21:33:53] <coldhead> that's forbidden
[21:34:23] <goddard> im confused on the method then i suppose
[21:35:09] <goddard> i have about 20 select boxes generated and i used an id to associate my function and do an ajax call but it only works with the first select box
[21:35:25] <coldhead> maybe if you show us the code
[21:35:32] <coldhead> it will be clearer how to help you
[21:35:35] <coldhead> to help yourself
[21:35:37] <coldhead> as jesus would have
[21:35:43] <goddard> ok ill try it is quite alot
[21:36:26] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/wvXQt/
[21:36:44] <goddard> it is in my php template so if it doesn't make sense tell me
[21:36:49] <martisj> seriously, wtf http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/AAeCm/1/
[21:37:11] <martisj> can't get hover() to display and hide with visibility
[21:38:20] <martisj> coldhead: thanks re: bind, on convenience
[21:38:27] <martisj> so it's slightly faster to run on() ?
[21:39:46] <coldhead> goddard: http://jsfiddle.net/wvXQt/1/
[21:40:00] <coldhead> not noticeably faster, martisj
[21:40:09] <martisj> aha.
[21:40:19] <coldhead> it's just supposed to be more idiomatic
[21:40:31] <coldhead> in the future your children will only know on()
[21:41:18] <coldhead> martisj: http://jsfiddle.net/AAeCm/2/
[21:41:23] <coldhead> you want find() instead of children()
[21:41:25] <phiz> coldhead: it's not $this it's this
[21:41:31] <coldhead> children only does immediat children
[21:41:44] <phiz> and $(this) i mean
[21:42:22] <martisj> coldhead: aha
[21:42:22] <martisj> thanks
[21:42:26] <goddard> coldhead: excellent thanks bro
[21:42:26] <coldhead> okay $phiz
[21:42:36] <martisj> isn't the .edit-class an immediate child of the tr?
[21:43:10] <coldhead> there is probably a td between them?
[21:43:28] <martisj> that is true :)
[21:43:32] <martisj> i see now :)
[21:43:33] <martisj> thanks
[21:57:51] <xboi209> hi?
[21:58:04] <chare> with draggable and droppable stuff in jqueryui suppose i have some condition that cancels a drop
[21:58:07] <chare> how do i make that work?

[22:10:53] <xboi209> jsfiddle plz?
[22:17:34] <katsh> not sure how to do that, it's ajax based. couldn't i just link to the site?
[22:19:52] <katsh> just kidding. upgraged to latest version, all is well.
[22:32:02] <xboi209> is anyone here to help?
[22:36:05] <astropirate> i am here because i was told there would be food :S
[22:36:50] <paul_irish_> astropirate: you seen epic meal time?

[22:36:58] <paul_irish_> just ask
[22:37:03] <paul_irish_> if its juicy people will bite
[22:37:04] <xboi209> :o
[22:37:41] <astropirate> paul_irish_, is that where they mix weired things up and cook it?
[22:37:52] <paul_irish_> often.
[22:38:04] <paul_irish_> fast food sushi is a pretty delightful one
[22:38:21] <xboi209> hmm
[22:39:10] <paul_irish_> SO READY To help you right now
[22:39:22] <xboi209> oh sorry
[22:39:26] <xboi209> internet problems right now
[22:41:24] <badbandit> anyone have experience equalizing the heights of a grid of div elements
[22:41:25] <badbandit> ?
[22:43:49] <paul_irish_> a grid?
[22:45:07] <donCams> is paul_irish_ really paul irish? :)
[22:45:26] <paul_irish_> must be a fake. has an underscore tail
[22:45:34] <donCams> must be
[22:45:39] <donCams> :D
[22:52:49] <xboi209> if i had function xboi209(variable){ $("#div").after(variable); } xboi209("hello1");xboi209("hello2");    how do i get hello2 to not overwrite hello1?
[22:55:54] <arielserafini> xboi209: it won't overwrite
[22:56:04] <arielserafini> xboi209: http://jsfiddle.net/SBGmX/
[22:56:09] <Whirl3d> Good evenin' all. Does anyone have a suggestion for a good plugin that will automatically convert a div with text into two columns of roughly the same height if the width of the original div is too big for a single column?
[22:56:45] <xboi209> ooo
[22:56:48] <Whirl3d> That was not easy to word, so if I made no sense, tell me and I'll try again.
[22:58:17] <Cork> Whirl3d: most of that can be done through plain css
[22:58:25] <Cork> Whirl3d: and its really where it should be
[22:59:09] <Whirl3d> Cool. I'll ask there. Thanks for the advice. I know jquery better than css.
[22:59:20] <arielserafini> Whirl3d: maybe this? http://welcome.totheinter.net/columnizer-jquery-plugin/
[23:03:49] <xboi209> arielserafini: http://jsfiddle.net/SBGmX/1/ can you see what i did wrong here?
[23:04:07] <xboi209> or wait
[23:04:08] <xboi209> nvm
[23:04:26] <xboi209> here http://jsfiddle.net/SBGmX/2/
[23:04:38] <martisj> how can i prevent that a hidden element doesn't get displayed before the hover event handler has been bound ?
[23:05:03] <AdamPDotty> double negation, really?
[23:05:27] <arielserafini> xboi209: :)
[23:05:35] <xboi209> :o
[23:06:30] <arielserafini> martisj: can you reword that?
[23:06:48] <martisj> like in this screenshot: https://dl.dropbox.com/s/w5yvs2r7m01vc3b/screen-shot-2012-09-28-at-4-04-01-pm.png
[23:07:05] <martisj> arielserafini: the screenshot should clarify
[23:07:11] <arielserafini> okay
[23:07:50] <arielserafini> martisj: still don't get it
[23:07:53] <martisj> there is one row that has the buttons displayed even though the default state should be hidden, and when i then move the mouse over that row the buttons disappear
[23:07:58] <xboi209> arielserafini: http://jsfiddle.net/SBGmX/3/
[23:07:59] <arielserafini> ah
[23:08:01] <martisj> make more sense?
[23:08:17] <Cork> your talking about the +Add ?
[23:08:40] <arielserafini> xboi209: you want to add both items?
[23:08:44] <arielserafini> martisj: yes
[23:08:46] <xboi209> yeah
[23:08:57] <xboi209> i dont want them to overwrite each other
[23:09:03] <Cork> xboi209: you can't use .html if you want append
[23:09:06] <Cork> use .append
[23:09:15] <martisj> arielserafini: do you know how to prevent that from happening?
[23:09:21] <AdamPDotty> still hover sounds like css, not js
[23:09:23] <xboi209> o.o
[23:09:37] <arielserafini> martisj: are they hidden in css?
[23:09:55] <arielserafini> xboi209: http://jsfiddle.net/SBGmX/6/
[23:09:57] <martisj> arielserafini: yes, vis_hidden
[23:09:57] <Cork> xboi209: and div is not allowed inside table
[23:09:58] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/SBGmX/5/
[23:09:59] <AdamPDotty> element{visibility:hidden;} element:hover{visibility:visible;}
[23:10:27] <xboi209> is class allowed inside table?
[23:10:28] <martisj> arielserafini: hidden with a class and toggled with jquery
[23:10:33] <martisj> xboi209: yes
[23:10:44] <martisj> xboi209: classes are not elements
[23:11:06] <xboi209> oh gosh
[23:11:06] <arielserafini> martisj: can you make a fiddle?
[23:11:08] <xboi209> its night now
[23:11:09] <martisj> AdamPDotty: what if i want to show an element that is inside the element being hidden?
[23:11:13] <xboi209> im mixing up stuff
[23:11:13] <Cork> xboi209: only allowed child of <table> is <tr> <thead> <tfoot> and <tbody>
[23:11:14] <arielserafini> maybe something is making it show
[23:11:17] <arielserafini> hard to guess
[23:12:06] <AdamPDotty> cork: caption, colgroup :-)
[23:12:08] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/AAeCm/
[23:12:10] <martisj> arielserafini:
[23:12:14] <martisj> arielserafini: ^^
[23:12:20] <Cork> AdamPDotty: true :)
[23:12:24] <Cork> though they
[23:12:33] <Cork> *'r quite rarely used
[23:12:44] <AdamPDotty> but I always wanted to
[23:12:50] <xboi209> :D thnx everyone who helped me
[23:12:51] <martisj> i think the class is being toggled before it has been applied.
[23:12:53] <martisj> i don't know
[23:12:56] <martisj> hard to sayu
[23:12:57] <Cork> colgroup is quite nice
[23:12:59] <Cork> a bit buggy though
[23:13:31] <Cork> don't think i've ever used caption in a real site
[23:13:46] <martisj> anyway it should be fine for now :)
[23:13:49] <Cork> xboi209: btw your not closing your head tr
[23:14:39] <xboi209> head tr?
[23:15:03] <Cork> <table><tr><th>.....</tr> <-- missing
[23:15:06] <xboi209> ehh i got my code working
[23:15:36] <xboi209> Cork: That was there with my edit
[23:15:42] <xboi209> I think you accidentally took that out
[23:16:00] <xboi209> mine is 4, yours is 5, and ariel is 6
[23:16:05] <Cork> ah, ya you had duplicate tr instead
[23:16:10] <xboi209> look at difference between 4 n 5
[23:16:42] <xboi209> anyways, the main code is fixed now
[23:16:44] <xboi209> thanks
[23:16:46] <Cork> you had <tr><div id='row'><tr><td></td></tr></div>
[23:17:54] <icedwater> Hi! I'd like to get the href of the <a> that I am currently hovering over. .attr() doesn't seem to work though. Any ideas?
[23:18:29] <Siridoes> hi guys i am using JQM but $(document).bind('pageinit',function(){}); is not firing i have been stuck at it for the past 24hrs tried a lot of things but $(doument).ready()
[23:18:34] <Siridoes> works
[23:19:02] <icedwater> So why not use ready()?
[23:19:17] <icedwater> It seems so much simpler to me... I'm a newb so I prefer the more obvious options.
[23:21:14] <Siridoes> JQM uses pageinit instead of ready
[23:21:21] <Siridoes> but it does not work :|
[23:21:51] <icedwater> Ah, I guess this is mobile?
[23:22:07] <Siridoes> yes
[23:23:11] <icedwater> This seems to be a decent solution for you. http://stackoverflow.com/a/7628926
[23:29:50] <icedwater> Is it possible to make little preview panes like Google Chrome has using jQuery?
[23:30:58] <Cork> icedwater: you mean the "speed dail"?
[23:31:14] <Cork> the grid of thumbnails for pages?
[23:32:20] <icedwater> Something like that, yes.
[23:32:41] <Cork> gecko has -moz-element
[23:32:47] <bobdobbs`> Hi guys. I'm trying to get the values of a bunch of inputs that share the same classname. So far I have this: http://pastebin.com/2zHsUAHZ
[23:33:00] <Cork> with some limitations you can do it in canvas
[23:33:21] <bobdobbs`> however, for each element, I now get the string: [object HTMLInputElement]
[23:33:24] <Cork> icedwater: but apart from those two no its not possible
[23:33:31] <bobdobbs`> How do I get the actual values?
[23:33:33] <icedwater> Right... I'll look into it, thanks :)
[23:33:56] <Cork> icedwater: canvas has high limitations to what it allows to render
[23:34:15] <Cork> bobdobbs`: use console.log
[23:34:26] <Cork> don't kill the kittens! ;)
[23:34:51] <bobdobbs`> Cork: well, ultimately, I want to add up the inputs.
[23:34:53] <Cork> seriously alert is a really bad tool for debugging/testing
[23:34:57] <bobdobbs`> I'm trying to produce a sum
[23:35:03] <bobdobbs`> ah, ok
[23:35:05] <Cork> $(this).val()
[23:35:21] <bobdobbs`> Ah! wrap it in $().
[23:35:22] <Cork> that will get you the content of the input feel instead of the dom element
[23:35:29] <Cork> bobdobbs`: thats not really it
[23:35:31] <Whirl3d> parseInt($(this).val())
[23:35:33] <bobdobbs`> I see
[23:35:36] <bobdobbs`> thanks :)
[23:35:36] <Cork> this is the dom element
[23:35:51] <Cork> you want the equiv of this.value
[23:38:32] <znowi> given a simple "ul > li > a" nav, which one is faster: a.parent().parent().find('a').removeClass('active') or $('ul a').removeClass('active')?
[23:39:13] <Cork> znowi: if you don't have many other ul's on the page
[23:39:18] <Cork> the second one
[23:39:51] <Cork> if you go with the first one i would prob go with a.closest().find('a').removeClass('active')
[23:39:57] <Cork> uh...
[23:40:05] <Cork> if you go with the first one i would prob go with a.closest('ul').find('a').removeClass('active')
[23:42:29] <icedwater> Thanks Cork, I'll be back later. Have fun guys.
[23:43:52] <znowi> Cork: thanks. i imagine closest would be subtly slower as it will have to check each level.
[23:44:14] <Cork> znowi: its just a loop over .parent()
[23:44:29] <znowi> ah
[23:44:41] <Cork> so no its not noticeably slower, and it makes the code so much easier to read, that its worth it
[23:46:14] <znowi> Cork: ok, i'll go with this one. thanks. the page is full of dom elements, so i try to avoid $().
[23:46:51] <Cork> znowi: its just good practice to try to limit your selectors to the area your working in
[23:46:59] <WasserDragoon> hi does anyone know why i cannot run this little script: http://jsfiddle.net/GzhCW/
[23:47:09] <Cork> znowi: that way the code doesn't break when something new is added a few months down the road
[23:47:35] <WasserDragoon> i commented out the effect param to get the submit working but now it doesnt uses the custom effect
[23:49:35] <WasserDragoon> lol got it working there was a missing third param in $.tools.validator.addEffect
[23:57:04] <bobdobbs`> I've got this line in my function: sum = sum + $(this).val() ;
[23:57:20] <bobdobbs`> But 'sum' gets concaneted to, rather then added to.
[23:57:34] <bobdobbs`> How to I get addition rather then concatenation ?
[23:58:19] <Cork> ?eval 10 + "15"
[23:58:23] <bot-t> Cork: "1015"
[23:58:27] <Cork> ?eval 10 + 15
[23:58:28] <bot-t> Cork: 25
[23:58:38] <Cork> ?eval 10 + parseInt("15", 10)
[23:58:39] <bot-t> Cork: 25
[23:59:01] <Cork> bobdobbs`: your adding a string to sum, not calculating numbers
[23:59:23] <ISDP> hello =]
