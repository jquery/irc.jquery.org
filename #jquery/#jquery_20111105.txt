[00:42:20] <johnywp> hey all
[00:42:54] <johnywp> some data is sent through POST to a .php page. How can I print the response?
[00:44:39] <asdf`> johnywp, jQuery.post's 3rd argument is a callback function
[00:45:03] <johnywp> the problem is that the post is being done through a 3rd-party plugin
[00:45:18] <johnywp> and i don't have access to it to see exactly how it's being done
[00:45:35] <johnywp> all I can see is the page to which the data is POSTed and the responce that it's giving
[00:45:57] <johnywp> and I just need to print that response (Firebug "prints" it somehow)
[01:16:21] <nieksand> Does anyone know what the size limit on the internal selector cache is?
[02:13:10] <tomoyuki28jp> When we use ajax, is there a way to rewrite the current url without redirecting? It's just for reloading.
[02:14:12] <apollo13> tomoyuki28jp: pushState, only for new browsers
[02:14:33] <apollo13> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history the rest needs some kind of hashtag navigation
[02:15:21] <tomoyuki28jp> apollo13: thanks a lot!
[02:15:43] <tomoyuki28jp> apollo13: even adding get parameters make users redirect for most of major browsers, correct?
[02:15:59] <apollo13> tomoyuki28jp: yes hence hashtags ala #!bla…
[02:16:00] <tomoyuki28jp> s/for/in/
[02:16:13] <tomoyuki28jp> apollo13: ah!
[02:16:16] <apollo13> you could look at the router from backbone.js to get a feeling for it
[02:16:28] <tomoyuki28jp> apollo13: thanks a lot for your help!
[02:16:31] <apollo13> eg new browser get /page/bla and old ones get /#!page/bla or so
[02:16:37] <apollo13> np
[02:16:39] <tomoyuki28jp> :)
[02:24:34] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> hi
[02:25:03] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> how can i optimize posts loading here - http://www.trolls.lv/%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F ?
[02:25:11] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> they are fetched until they fill container
[02:25:14] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> which is resizeable
[02:25:22] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> is there a better way to do it?
[02:25:28] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> now they are just fetched by 16
[02:37:26] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> hi
[02:37:38] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> i need a way to predict how many element should be fetched on container resize
[02:37:40] <`sudo_kill_9_-1`> any ideas?
[02:54:20] <ppcano> does anybody know a fix or clear explanation because in chrome set $().height(Value) and $().height() returns Value-2 pixels. After applying many different reset CSS, the problem still persist in Chrome ( my current dev browser )

[03:53:39] <cook1es> I have run XHR on a page and have the source in my variable, how can I select an element like I would in my own source with $('#example') - in the XHR source?
[03:56:21] <cook1es> I thought that I could use $(var).find('#example'); but $(var) doesn't return the html element, do I need to convert the string of source into a jQuery element somehow?
[04:14:21] <dnsdds> I have an element and inside it a checkbox. I want one thing to happen when you click on the checkbox, and another when you click anywhere else within the element. Currently the checkbox however triggers both. How do I stop it from doing that?

[04:22:26] <sean`> lol
[04:26:20] <dnsdds> Famic: That sounds ideal but doesn't seem to work; I'm using the click() event for the element and the change() event for the checkbox, does that make a difference?
[04:27:58] <styol> dnsdds: could try adding to your click selector something like #element:not(input[type=checkbox])
[04:29:06] <dnsdds> Worth a punt...
[04:29:20] <cook1es> Is it possible to convert string "<html><body>hi</body></html>" into nodeList / node?
[04:29:48] <dnsdds> styol: Nope, not doing the trick :(
[04:30:05] <Famic> dnsdds: got a test page ?
[04:30:49] <dnsdds> Famic: I can arrange one, hang tight...
[04:30:52] <Famic> cook1es: html/body are quite specific
[04:33:41] <cook1es> Famic: what do you mean
[04:34:10] <Famic> only what I said
[04:34:26] <cook1es> Famic: I don't understand what that means
[04:34:37] <cook1es> Famic: so what do you mean with what you said
[04:35:12] <michelem> hello folks
[04:35:17] <Famic> trying to add html/body into the dom may not work as well as adding a div or span
[04:35:30] <michelem> I have a nasty problem with this popup code: http://test.buddyns.com/
[04:36:01] <michelem> the code itself is http://test.buddyns.com/scripts/popup.js
[04:36:52] <michelem> as you can see from the page, the problem is, occasionally the popup does not show up. I can't figure out why
[04:37:09] <cook1es> Famic: I never said I wanted to add them into the DOM, I want to convert a string with html elements into a node
[04:37:22] <Famic> michelem: htat's probably because the previous one didn't stop hidding yet
[04:38:03] <michelem> Famic: so how do you suggest going around it? Does it take keeping a "work queue" of popups to handle?
[04:38:11] <Famic> cook1es: what do you call a node if not inserting into the dom ?
[04:39:28] <cook1es> Famic: Hmm?
[04:39:30] <Famic> michelem: just make sure there is no currently closing popup before you allow a new one to try and appear
[04:40:00] <Famic> cook1es: you're making no sense here
[04:40:45] <cook1es> Famic: "what do you call a node if not inserting into the dom ?" what do you mean with this? the sentence doesnt make any sense to me
[04:41:28] <Famic> cook1es: good luck
[04:42:58] <cook1es> Famic: wow really? can't you just correct your sentence into correct grammar
[04:44:19] <Famic> cook1es: right, that'll kind of remark qill probably help you sort out your problem
[04:46:07] * cook1es slaps Famic.
[04:46:44] <Famic> you make friends really easily, don't you ? ^^
[04:46:50] <dnsdds> Famic: Alright, http://jsfiddle.net/m7nPm/
[04:47:39] <cook1es> Famic: You are the most illogical human being I have ever met. You tried to help me, failed, wrote up a improper grammar sentence which I did not understand, and then I was offending you when I asked you to correct it.
[04:50:10] <Famic> cook1es: and here you are, pointing out grammer flows in people trying to help you and saying they "failed" to do so, and thinking you will fix your problem faster this way. Good luck with that logic. I'm done with it.
[04:51:04] <especially-corn> can anyone tell me why some jquery code does not get executed even tho it's in in the $(document).ready(function(){ block?
[04:51:30] <cook1es> Famic: question ask me speak this like and come we long way, you to according. Good luck with that. ;)
[04:51:40] <michelem> Famic: I can't seem to go around it. Any tip for a ready-made library that does popups?
[04:51:42] <Famic> especially-corn: where is that block located ?
[04:52:00] <cook1es> especially-corn: Any javascript errors?
[04:52:14] <michelem> I like the effect on http://sendgrid.com/pricing.html , but the code is so huge that even isolating the popup part is a challenge
[04:52:29] <especially-corn> no javascript errors
[04:53:11] <especially-corn> Famic, that's my html and jquery file "headers" http://paste.ubuntu.com/http://paste.ubuntu.com/729011/
[04:53:13] <especially-corn> http://paste.ubuntu.com/729011/
[04:53:27] <especially-corn> the script is in normal.js
[04:54:35] <Famic> especially-corn: what part is not executed ?
[04:54:36] <especially-corn> cook1es, Famic, the preparediv function from the js doesn't execute
[04:54:50] <especially-corn> the dialog opens but it's not "prepared"
[04:55:10] <Famic> where is the prepareDiv function declaration ?
[04:55:41] <especially-corn> right under the document ready
[04:57:04] <Famic> Are you sure it's not called ? what happens if you place a alert("called"); at the beginning of that function ?
[04:57:39] <especially-corn> Famic, i'm not sure because the code executes most of the time
[04:57:46] <especially-corn> but some times it doesn't
[04:57:57] <especially-corn> (when it doesn't it doesn't for the whole page not just one div)
[04:59:14] <Famic> michelem: your current popup is quite nice. you just need to attach a var somewhere when you begin hiding the popup and check on it before launching a new one
[04:59:26] <Famic> then when the hiding completes reset that var
[05:00:04] <Famic> especially-corn: does it depend onddaccordion or expand.js ?
[05:00:14] <michelem> Famic: that variable is already in place. I think the problem is actually that.
[05:00:19] <especially-corn> Famic, no, those are on another side of the page
[05:00:55] <especially-corn> but i noticed that if those are loaded before the normal.js it never works
[05:01:12] <michelem> the problem is: sometimes, popups do not show up. I guess that's because I move to an icon before the old popup disappeared. So the mouseover code is returned immediately.
[05:01:54] <Famic> michelem: right
[05:02:15] <michelem> for the moment, I resolved by reducing the animation time. But it's a quick & dirty fix, not a right one.
[05:02:48] <Famic> michelem: you could create a new popup instance instead of trying to use the same one then
[05:02:57] <michelem> that's right, fuck me.
[05:03:11] <Famic> no thanks
[05:03:17] <michelem> that code is not mine, I was actually realizing the same: why are they not separate instances?!
[05:03:31] <especially-corn> Famic, do you think ddaccordion might influence the normal js?
[05:03:59] <Famic> especially-corn: I don't know, but if it alters the dom there could be conflicts
[05:04:35] <Famic> you need to figure out exactly where/when it goes wrong if you want to fix it
[05:05:26] <especially-corn> Famic, http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex17/ddaccordionmenu-bullet.htm
[05:05:33] <especially-corn> Famic, that's the ddaccordion
[05:06:12] <Famic> especially-corn: just try without ddacordion, if you can't make the bug reproduce, you'll know it has something ot do with it
[05:06:33] <especially-corn> Famic, i can rarely make it reproduce with the ddaccordion
[05:06:56] <Famic> that looks like a race condition imho
[05:07:39] <especially-corn> Famic, so is there a way to force ddaccordion and expand.js to be executed after normal.js?
[05:07:55] <and7ey> Hi all, could you please help me to understand how to get id of combobox within $.widget( "ui.combobox", { _create: function() { source: function?
[05:08:18] <michelem> what is the best practice for handling non-existing IDs? Shall I just ignore it so the developer sees the exception in his js console, or shall I validate it with an "if" and return silently?
[05:08:57] <Famic> especially-corn: you shouldn't have to ressort to that.
[05:09:25] <Famic> dig until you find the problem's origin, then figure out the best way to fix it
[05:11:20] <especially-corn> Famic, i moved the content of expand.js to normal.js below the document ready, does that guarantee that it will be executed after the document ready block is executed??
[05:11:32] <Famic> nope
[05:12:06] <Famic> document.ready code will wait for the document to be ready
[05:12:22] <especially-corn> if it
[05:12:32] <especially-corn> if it's inside the document.ready at the end of the block?
[05:12:57] <Famic> that would be very dirty. but yeah, the code would be axecuted after the rest of it
[05:13:13] <especially-corn> Famic, not really since the expand.js only contains 5 lines of code
[05:13:33] <especially-corn> oh yea, if the code is inside document.ready the page refuses to load for some reason
[05:13:40] <Famic> especially-corn: that's still a dirty fix. If there is only 5 lines of code, you should be able to figure out what the problem is
[05:13:43] <especially-corn> no errors in the console
[05:14:07] <especially-corn> those 5 lines of code are configuration files for the ddaccordion which is pretty long
[05:14:22] <sean`> bot-t, tell guy ping me plz
[05:14:23] <bot-t> sean`, Okay.
[05:16:04] <dnsdds> Nobody has a solution to my problem? :(
[05:16:16] <and7ey> could you please help me to understand how to get id of combobox within $.widget( "ui.combobox", { _create: function() { source: function?
[05:16:17] <cook1es> How can I convert a string into a jQuery object?
[05:16:33] <kggle> hey, i want to trigger a .click(function..) on a link with a class, but the class is added after the js is called, how i can get this work?
[05:16:54] <Famic> and7ey: $(this).attr('id') or something like that
[05:16:57] <cook1es> kggle: use .live()
[05:17:09] <kggle> cook1es, thanks!
[05:18:28] <Famic> dnsdds: you are setting the click event on the div, what do you expect ?
[05:18:35] <Ezek2k4> i have 8 autcompletes on 1 page and its kinda slowy now is there something i could do about it?
[05:19:17] <dnsdds> Famic: I expect it to not fire when I click on the checkbox, which is a different element with a higher z-index
[05:20:11] <especially-corn> Famic, is there a problem if there area two document.ready functions?
[05:20:57] <Famic> especially-corn: not really... that's like binding several click events on an element
[05:21:25] <especially-corn> Famic, i noticed the ddaccordion also has a document ready function
[05:21:35] <especially-corn> this just doens't make any sense
[05:21:41] <especially-corn> why wont it work
[05:21:46] <Kat`away> hello, is there any chance to get this work? http://paste.org/pastebin/view/40593
[05:22:11] <Kat`away> i need variable field to be not $_POST['variable']
[05:22:25] <Famic> especially-corn: define won't work
[05:22:39] <especially-corn> Famic, the prepareDIV doesn't always execute
[05:23:25] <Famic> especially-corn: are you sure it doesn't execute ? maybe it just doesn't have the correct parameters and crashes
[05:23:55] <dnsdds> Kat`away: Then rename it?
[05:24:19] <Famic> dnsdds: event.currentTarget will help you
[05:24:20] <Kat`away> but i need that one to be taken from f ( variable
[05:24:31] <Kat`away> i mean function top
[05:24:54] <dnsdds> Kat`away: { whateveryouwant: $('#'+variable).val() }
[05:25:05] <especially-corn> Famic, the parameters are good unless the ddaccordion changes the page, i always have <div id="43242"><div class="box">CONTENT</div><p class="date">modify box</p></div>
[05:25:07] <dnsdds> Famic: Thanks a bunch! :)
[05:25:31] <Kat`away> but whateveryouwant must be variable from function header
[05:25:31] <especially-corn> Famic, it's always like that and the preparediv takes the id, the content and the content of the paragraph and inserts it in the dialog
[05:25:37] <especially-corn> Famic, it's always supposed to be there
[05:26:01] <dnsdds> Kat`away: And that's done in the second part with the second "variable" within the $()
[05:26:01] <Famic> especially-corn: it's supposed not to crash too
[05:26:18] <especially-corn> Famic, the server side is good
[05:26:30] <especially-corn> also the javascript should too since it does display properly
[05:26:31] <Kat`away> yes, but field name must be the same ;)
[05:26:50] <dnsdds> Kat`away: So... exactly what are you trying do then?
[05:27:14] <Famic> especially-corn: I can't help you much with the available info. Maybe if you can set a test page
[05:28:01] <Kat`away> function f ( variable, id ), let it be like i call f ( "name", "1" ), and i need to have $_POST['name']
[05:28:10] <and7ey> Famic: it doesn't work, unfortunately (undefined is returned), please see the code - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8020040/how-to-define-different-sources-for-2-comboboxes
[05:29:10] <especially-corn> Famic, is it ok if i private you?
[05:29:48] <Famic> especially-corn: ok but make it wuick
[05:29:56] <Famic> *quick
[05:30:17] <Kat`away> so any1 ? is there any chance to get this work? http://paste.org/pastebin/view/40593 ?
[05:30:18] <Kat`away> function f ( variable, id ), let it be like i call f ( "name", "1" ), and i need to have $_POST['name']
[05:30:45] <Famic> and7ey: doesn't item.id contain the id you're looking for ?
[05:31:14] <brutal_chaos> Simple question (hopeuflly). I am using jquery 1.6.4 and I am try to get the vlue of a combobox selection. I have tried a couple different ways and keep getting the text of the selection, not the value. Is there a simple way to do this? .val(), .value, are giving me the text.
[05:32:06] <dnsdds> Kat`away: http://www.highdots.com/forums/javascript/setting-json-key-variable-283370.html
[05:32:07] <and7ey> Famic: item is not defined at this stage..
[05:33:15] <Famic> you need to dig into the widget plugin
[05:33:38] <Famic> it is passed two parameters : "ui.combobox" and an option object
[05:34:04] <Famic> we can't guess how to get back to the combobox from one of the function passed in the option object
[05:34:20] <Famic> it might even not be possible
[05:34:27] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, if I use ".mouseenter" event, that means ".mouseleave" event will not fired if I am under the area of the element right? if so, then why "mouseleave" event is firing when I am over on another element but till under mother element? Please discuss..

[05:46:54] <Famic> and7ey: you need to dissect the plugin to find your answer
[05:47:54] <brutal_chaos> dabear: I just tried it again... I am still getting text. From the link you sent me, it works, on my page I am writting (which uses the same code!!) it doesn't. So confused.
[05:49:02] <dabear> brutal_chaos: maybe you haven't specified any value="" in the option
[05:49:37] <brutal_chaos> dabear: I definitely have... I just rechecked.

[05:50:18] <brutal_chaos> I don't know that I legally can.
[05:51:11] <dabear> brutal_chaos: strip out anything not related to the error
[05:51:41] <dabear> brutal_chaos: .val will give you the text if value="" is not specified in the option
[05:51:53] <dabear> that has to be the error
[05:52:59] <Kat`away> thanks dnsdds for help
[05:53:14] <dnsdds> Kat`away: no problem

[05:58:55] <brutal_chaos> jsfiddle...<3 <3
[06:00:48] <michelem> I changed the code to instantiate one separate popup object per element
[06:00:54] <michelem> the new code is here: http://test.buddyns.com/
[06:01:23] <michelem> I declare a "class" called BuddyPopUp(elemid, htmlcontent), and instantiate it N times on window.onload
[06:01:47] <michelem> however, the elements I pass are "undefined" all the time.
[06:02:41] <dabear> michelem: wheres the code
[06:03:17] <dabear> what lines should I look at?
[06:03:30] <michelem> dabear: see the link above, module "popup.js"
[06:03:44] <michelem> function BuddyPopUp
[06:04:26] <dabear> yep, and?
[06:04:27] <michelem> I look up some element IDs in there. They do exist in the HTML, but they result in "undefined" in the js
[06:06:21] <dabear> michelem: why can't you just use $(document).ready( function(){ new buddy.....})
[06:06:40] <michelem> dabear: thanks, I didn't know that one.
[06:06:59] <michelem> I'll change it now, however that load function should work, the problem is somewhere else
[06:07:38] <dabear> have you used the console?
[06:07:51] <dabear> you can set breakpoints and check for your self what elements exist in the dom
[06:07:52] <michelem> confirming.
[06:08:00] <Guest76410> hi
[06:08:27] <sahbeewah> can i use .html() on an element which isn't attached to a document
[06:08:47] <michelem> dabear: yes. I issue "document" and I do see the given IDs
[06:09:50] <dabear> michelem: you are so unspesific. please tell me what line in popup.js fails, and what you did to test it
[06:11:48] <sahbeewah> i'm trying something like, var el = document.createElement("li"); el.html("test"); $("ul").append(el);
[06:12:02] <sahbeewah> is there any reason why that wouldn't work
[06:13:18] <Famic> sahbeewah: "test" doesn't look much of a html element
[06:14:09] <sahbeewah> can't you put regular text there as if it were a textnode
[06:14:18] <sahbeewah> i thought it was interchangable with .innerHTML
[06:14:34] <sahbeewah> because if you replace it with, el.innerHTML = "test"; it works
[06:14:39] <dabear> michelem:  if (document.getElementById(elementid)) {
[06:14:39] <dabear>         alert('Element ' + elementid + ' not found.');
[06:15:19] <dabear> michelem: that seems wrong anyway. you are now basically saying "if element with that id does exist, alert a message saying it does not exist"
[06:15:36] <michelem> dabear: that's for debugging
[06:16:02] <dabear> logic is wrong
[06:16:17] <dabear> the element does exist
[06:16:23] <michelem> oh, sorry, ya right

[09:37:22] <AaronDCampbell> I know that the JSON global isn't really part of jQuery, but does anyone here know if there's a way to check if a string is JSON before passing it through JSON.parse?  If the string isn't as expected I get an error: "JSON.parse: unexpected character"
[09:37:52] <sneakyness> paste it into jsonlint?
[09:38:55] <AaronDCampbell> programatically...a check I can put in place to offer a friendly error instead of actually causing an error
[09:39:20] <sneakyness> Hm, maybe you could use try/catch or whatever?
[09:39:32] <sneakyness> I never really use it because I've seen people do really scary things with it
[09:40:30] <sneakyness> AaronDCampbell: are you familiar with it?
[09:41:29] <AaronDCampbell> sneakyness: Putting it to work right now as a test
[09:41:57] <AaronDCampbell> Basically try{JSON.parse('something');} catch(e) { /*do something else*/ }

[09:53:25] <cafaro> Damianos: as in textarea.prop("selection..")
[09:53:47] <Damianos> no as in there is text in the textarea and the user highlights the text with the mouse

[09:55:31] <knockknockimhere> can anyone help me with a jquery UI draggable problem please? :)
[09:55:34] <RandalSchwartz> just realized jq is up to 1.7.  Is there a list of things that might break if I upgrade from 1.4.2?
[09:55:34] <cafaro> Damianos: Maybe something like textarea.val().substring(selectionStart, selectioEnd) ?
[09:56:53] <knockknockimhere> anyone? :)
[09:57:39] <sneakyness> knockknockimhere: don't ask to ask, just ask. Post it so we can debug it

[10:13:07] <ofsalla> can anyone solve this problem http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8020652/reading-location-header-when-http-status-301-302-at-a-xhr-request ?
[10:13:18] <knockknockimhere> o.O 1 sec
[10:13:38] <knockknockimhere> http://jsfiddle.net/x39cV/4/
[10:13:40] <knockknockimhere> try again
[10:13:42] <knockknockimhere> xD
[10:14:23] <knockknockimhere> if you drag the layer div. the image inside it allways displaces 1 pixel too much in the last direction for some unknown reason.. it didnt do that with resizable. ( dont know why the resize aint working now tho )
[10:14:58] <especially-corn> Damianos, does it need to be a input button?
[10:15:32] <Damianos> no...actually I'm trying to do a contextmenu that will wrap the selected text in a tag
[10:16:26] <especially-corn> Damianos, http://jsfiddle.net/g76s5/7/ that works for the href if it's any consolation
[10:17:25] <especially-corn> Damianos, this one works for both http://jsfiddle.net/g76s5/10/
[10:17:27] <Damianos> I wish....I'd like to have the user select text and then click a button to alter the selected text. Like a WYSIWYG editor
[10:18:21] <especially-corn> Damianos, ooooh i see
[10:19:06] <Damianos> I have everything else in place except I don't know how to access the value of the user selected text
[10:20:15] <knockknockimhere> http://jsfiddle.net/x39cV/5/  <-- okey now : resize works, no weird displacement there, but there is displacement when dragging, tho uses the same funciton
[10:22:48] <ajpiano> Damianos: 1) if you are destroying the selection by clicking on something else and then trying to find out what the selection is... obviously there is no selection
[10:23:03] <ajpiano> 2) it's 2011, you don't have to write your own cross-browser selection manipulation shim
[10:23:16] <ajpiano> check out http://code.google.com/p/rangyinputs/ and its parent project http://code.google.com/p/rangy/
[10:23:48] <ajpiano> http://rangyinputs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/textinputs_jquery.html
[10:23:59] <especially-corn> can someone tell me why the slide action is acting crazy? http://95.76.74.76/at-008/at-009/
[10:25:30] <ajpiano> ?fix hover @ especially-corn
[10:25:31] <bot-t> especially-corn, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using throttle/debounce (http://bit.ly/e8d9TB). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
[10:25:47] <ajpiano> that's probably *part* of the equatoin
[10:26:16] <Damianos> ajpiano: that looks perfect!
[10:27:43] <knockknockimhere> http://jsfiddle.net/x39cV/5/ <-- does anyone have an idea why the iamge in the layer has a 1 px diplacement when dragging but not when resizing? :(
[10:27:49] <especially-corn> ajpiano, i don't understand the hoverindent thing
[10:28:09] <ajpiano> especially-corn: sliding out things because someone briefly hovers over something by accident
[10:28:14] <ajpiano> is not good
[10:28:17] <ajpiano> and can lead to very jerky stuff
[10:28:23] <especially-corn> sure can

[10:35:17] <knockknockimhere> hm okey
[10:35:49] <knockknockimhere> http://jsfiddle.net/x39cV/5/   in the "run"field, you see a darkened image. with a  draggable / resizable div. containing an image.
[10:36:41] <knockknockimhere> if you drag or resize the div, the image is moved to show the righ tportion of it
[10:36:59] <knockknockimhere> tho, when i drag it, it is displaced 1 pixel in the last direction >.<  while by resizing, i dont have that problem at all
[10:37:39] <Famic> I see
[10:38:10] <knockknockimhere> to me its weird, its the same function they are using, the one works and the other doesnt, i dont know what causes it. or how i could fix it
[10:38:40] <Famic> height: 45.0784px
[10:38:51] <Famic> half pixels are probably the issue here
[10:39:05] <knockknockimhere> thanks ill try and round them :)
[10:39:29] <knockknockimhere> the way you picked that out so quick makes me feel like a noob, been at it for 3 hours lol
[10:39:50] <Famic> ever heard of firebug? ^^
[10:40:28] <knockknockimhere> im using chromes element inspector :p
[10:41:00] <Famic> make you own conclusions ;p
[10:41:19] <knockknockimhere> haha
[10:42:20] <knockknockimhere> hey i dont think thats it.
[10:42:44] <knockknockimhere> when its displaced. it actually shows diffrent numbers at top:  and left  for the div and the image
[10:42:50] <knockknockimhere> while top and left should be the same for both
[10:43:39] <knockknockimhere> its like drag executes the function before finishing the last drag o.O
[10:44:00] <Famic> honestly I don't understand why you move the picture at all
[10:44:12] <knockknockimhere> how would you do it then? :D
[10:44:46] <knockknockimhere> its going to be a cropping interface for a small plugin on wordpress im making, theres other plugins but well, cant learn jquery by copy-pasta can ya... XD
[10:46:00] <Famic> maybe you're right you need to move it
[10:46:29] <Famic> copy+paste+understand+alter is a good way to lear though
[10:46:32] <Famic> *learn
[10:47:33] <knockknockimhere> ill try and scan the other plugins, see if they use jquery's draggable for this
[10:47:39] <Famic> "look at the master, follow the master, walk with the master, see through the master, become the master"
[10:47:45] <knockknockimhere> :P
[10:48:19] <knockknockimhere> veni vidi vici
[10:48:41] <Famic> alea jacta est :p
[10:48:49] <especially-corn> famic
[10:49:32] <Famic> especially-corn
[10:50:14] <especially-corn> http://95.76.74.76/at-008/at-009/ do you know how i can make the addclass smooth?
[10:50:50] <Famic> what do you mean by smooth addclass ? a class is either present or not
[10:51:49] <especially-corn> Famic, look now
[10:52:01] <Famic> I see my feet
[10:52:17] <especially-corn> it's smooth but if the user goes over the arrow multiple times before the animation finishes the divs keep resizing
[10:52:52] <Famic> what arrow ?
[10:53:08] <especially-corn> on the left
[10:53:17] <Famic> I don't see any
[10:53:23] <Famic> I recall seeing one earlier though
[10:54:22] <Famic> in chrome I see a + now
[10:55:01] <Famic> you just need to prevent the resize from starting if one is already in progress
[10:55:12] <Famic> and to make your code work in other browsers too
[10:55:47] <especially-corn> well yes, i do need to do that
[10:55:53] <especially-corn> that;s why i asked you if you know how
[10:56:27] <knockknockimhere> i do it by setting a variable,
[10:56:31] <Famic> well that's an easy call... You store a variable somewhere saying the transition is started, and you check on it when you start
[10:56:58] <knockknockimhere> whenever animation starts it gets true... whenever its finished, it returns to false... every event that can cause an animation will not do so unless the variable is false
[10:57:10] <knockknockimhere> famic beat me too it :(
[10:57:33] <Famic> so: onstart: if (!started) { started = true; start animation } oncomplete: { started = false }
[10:58:19] <Famic> you can hook it on anything that will be available in your script scope
[10:59:04] <Famic> if you set it on something global you'd better use some kind of namespacing though
[11:00:25] <Famic> for example I often end up using document.ProjectNameStorage = {}; document.projectNameStorage.started = true;
[11:00:53] <Famic> if you can avoid hooking on document that's better though
[11:01:42] <knockknockimhere> Famic, just added an event ( stop: function(){ resizeImage(); }     )   to the drag option... now whenever i let the mouse go after dragging, the image gets repositioned correctly
[11:02:20] <knockknockimhere> i think the drag event fires before actually moving the div
[11:02:33] <Famic> whatever works for you ;)
[11:02:44] <knockknockimhere> yeah its still ugly :P but well, its good enough for now lol
[11:03:41] <Famic> it all depends on the time available/quality expected ratio
[11:03:58] <Famic> it's often faster to produce clean code though
[11:07:49] <kaepora> Guys, is it just me, or are .animate() functions in jQuery 1.7 seriously broken when you deal with CSS values in percentages? Such as "width: 90%;"??
[11:08:36] <Famic> kaepora: if you set up a testcase we'll tell you how it renders
[11:09:02] <ajpiano> kaepora: it's a known issue
[11:09:10] <ajpiano> there's a bunch of bugs filed already on it
[11:09:53] <kaepora> ajpiano: Thank goodness
[11:10:01] <kaepora> ajpiano: Much appreciated, thanks
[11:18:23] <zw|home> Hello!  I have a general question, I have an object literal with closure that returns a public scope, why would the objects outside of the public scope still be visible in the global var?
[11:22:12] <zw|home> why would afunction, and afunction1 be visible in the DOM inspector, and accessible via test.afunction, and test.afunction1 outside of the closure?
[11:23:53] <zw|home> oops ( http://pastie.org/2816379 )
[11:28:16] <ryanneufeld> anyone know of a jquery-ui friendly wysiwyg editor?
[11:29:36] <snover> what is “jquery-ui friendly”?
[11:29:43] <snover> you mean “has themeroller classes”?
[11:29:45] <zw|home> hehe
[11:30:03] <ryanneufeld> snover: good call, I mean I'd like to add droppable support to it
[11:30:27] <abjorn> oh lawd
[11:30:29] <snover> droppable what?
[11:30:31] <abjorn> what should i do with my day
[11:30:39] <zw|home> c0de:)
[11:31:03] <abjorn> maaayybee
[11:32:30] <ryanneufeld> snover: I would like to make a wysiwyg editor that I bind jquery-ui's droppable support such that a user could drag an element from a draggable to it and have it trigger a callback on the editor
[11:36:41] <zw|home> anyone have an idea to the above question?
[11:38:04] <ryanneufeld> zw|home: what was your question?
[11:38:11] <ryanneufeld> I'm new here
[11:38:12] <ryanneufeld> today
[11:38:12] <zw|home> ah sorry, here you go:
[11:38:22] <zw|home> Hello!  I have a general question, I have an object literal with closure that returns a public scope, why would the objects outside of the public scope still be visible in the global var?
[11:38:44] <ryanneufeld> zw|home: do you have a jsfiddle example?
[11:39:01] <zw|home> heres a quick pastie
[11:39:01] <zw|home> http://pastie.org/2816379
[11:39:12] <zw|home> for some reason afunction1,afunction2
[11:39:25] <zw|home> are still accessible OUTSIDE of the object, I was under the impression that should not be the case
[11:40:30] <ryanneufeld> zw|home: javascript doesn't have the concept of private
[11:40:51] <zw|home> but they shouldn't pollute the global namespace eh?
[11:40:51] <ryanneufeld> so you can call test.afunction()
[11:41:14] <ryanneufeld> try it?
[11:41:24] <zw|home> I did, they show up
[11:41:39] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/XaGt8/
[11:41:57] <ryanneufeld> make that into an example the demonstrates what you're doing
[11:42:13] <zw|home> _map,_menu are both properties inside of XE, yet they show up globally
[11:42:14] <zw|home> http://screencast.com/t/ZC49ytbs8
[11:42:17] <zw|home> ah let me peak
[11:42:47] <ryanneufeld> zw|home: that tiny thumbnail is less than useless
[11:44:17] <snover> ryanneufeld: and why can’t you do that?
[11:44:55] <ryanneufeld> snover: turns out I can!
[11:45:54] <RandalSchwartz> if $foo is a select, is there a quick way to select option 0
[11:46:30] <ajpiano> RandalSchwartz: if it's an actual dom element, just set selectedIndex = 0;
[11:46:42] <ajpiano> if it's a jquery $foo[0].selectedIndex = 0;
[11:46:59] <RandalSchwartz> thanks aj
[11:47:08] <RandalSchwartz> can't do that from .val() though?
[11:47:16] <ajpiano> nope
[11:47:25] <ryanneufeld> RandalSchwartz: val will tell you the value of the selected option
[11:47:38] <ajpiano> you can use it as a setter too, but not for index based
[11:47:41] <ajpiano> only value based
[11:47:44] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:48:03] <RandalSchwartz> ok
[11:50:12] <zw|home> sorry ryann, took me just a moment
[11:50:12] <zw|home> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/XaGt8/
[11:50:53] <zw|home> notice that privateObj.afunction(); works, but test.privateObj.afunction(); does not work
[11:51:09] <zw|home> shouldn't privateObj.afunction() be hidden too?
[11:52:03] <zw|home> when using the closure, it introduces a new variable scope.. why would privateObj be introduced to the global at all?
[11:52:41] <techouse> i kinda need some sort of calendar with dates selected according to what php spits out of the database and then have those dates show a description of what's going on that date and when clicked lead to that article
[11:52:47] <techouse> can that be done with datepicker?
[11:56:26] <zw|home> ah, forgot to update the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/XaGt8/1/
[11:58:35] <ryanneufeld> zw|home: you're storing your closure
[11:58:50] <ryanneufeld> and javascript doesn't support private stuff
[11:58:55] <ryanneufeld> also
[11:59:01] <ryanneufeld> that's not global scope
[11:59:10] <ryanneufeld> oh, wait, yes it is
[11:59:23] <especially-corn> i need some help here guys, when it resizes back to the original size i lose content, http://95.76.74.76/at-008/
[11:59:34] <ryanneufeld> zw|home: AHA!
[11:59:43] <ryanneufeld> zw|home: you need var privateObj!
[11:59:49] <ryanneufeld> that's why it's global
[11:59:53] <zw|home> hehe yeah
[12:00:07] <zw|home> someone over in other place just gave me hint too, thanks a ton for your time ryan
[12:00:24] <zw|home> i knew that i was scoping it right, but i s'pose i just didn't catch that, obviously !! thanks so much =)

[12:09:25] <oal> I'm trying to use .draggable from jqueryui on a list, and it works fine until I add more elements to it. Can I "add" the dragging behavior to the new list elements.
[12:09:29] <oal> ?*
[12:09:45] <dabear> oal: run draggable() again
[12:11:55] <oal> dabear: thanks :)
[12:24:09] <knockknockimhere> Yo famic you there? solved the problem, thought you might be interested how its fixed for future problems?
[12:26:26] <Famic> knockknockimhere: if you're aiming for posterity, don't tell me, tell the world ;p
[12:26:39] <knockknockimhere> XD
[12:26:48] <knockknockimhere> haha, nah its something i overlooked, its in the docs :P
[12:27:51] <knockknockimhere> http://jsfiddle.net/x39cV/7/  <--
[12:27:53] <Famic> damn... I should have said rtfm
[12:28:19] <Famic> what doc are you talking about ?
[12:28:50] <knockknockimhere> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/   <-- says there, on the overview tab
[12:29:16] <knockknockimhere> should use ui.position.left  or top to get the new location :)
[12:30:40] * Famic slaps knockknockimhere around a bit with a large rtfm
[12:32:21] <knockknockimhere> xD
[12:32:51] <knockknockimhere> its true tho :(
[12:33:13] <nemesis_> hello
[12:33:47] <knockknockimhere> heya
[12:33:56] <nemesis_> i'm curious to know how to apply a theme to other controls in a form (i.e. not the jquery widgets)?
[12:34:45] <knockknockimhere> give them the same CSS classes?
[12:34:45] <Famic> you mean the ones jquery widgets replaced in order to make them themable ?
[12:35:19] <nemesis_> I have a form with a text input and a few select inputs. I'd like to theme them the same way
[12:35:41] <Famic> give them the same CSS classes?
[12:35:56] <Consolas> hey guys
[12:36:08] <nemesis_> I'm kinda new to all of this. Could you give me a little more?
[12:36:43] <Famic> nemesis_: css style is most likely applied according to the elements classes
[12:36:48] <Consolas> I'm trying to use Jquery UI and customize it so I have a general confirmation dialog, etc. I was wondering if I can load the "form" file (which have the message: you are about to delete whatever) and change the form action, fields (etc) from the dialog open command.
[12:37:01] <Famic> nemesis_: maybe you'd better just ask in #css
[12:37:08] <Consolas> I would .load('form'), - change stuff - , dialog.open
[12:37:10] <Consolas> is this possible ?
[12:37:12] <Famic> this has nothing to do with hquery actually
[12:37:38] <nemesis_> ok. thanks for the help. sorry to bother.
[12:38:42] <Consolas> Anyone use this dialog from jquery ui ?=
[12:38:57] <Consolas> or use .load with posterior values change on the loaded file ?
[12:39:32] <Famic> Consolas: answer is "probably"
[12:39:59] <Consolas> Well, that answer makes me doubt if this is the best approach
[12:40:04] <Famic> I'm not familiar with it but it looks like you just want to override some settings
[12:40:42] <Consolas> yeah, how would you approach this? I just need a main function that loads a file and change some values on that file, that is about it - want to have a general confirmation dialog sort to speak
[12:40:43] <igcewieling> if I have a class with visibility:hidden; it doesn't seem like jquery's fadein() will make it visible again? Is that correct or did screw up my code?
[12:41:44] <Famic> igcewieling: try fadeIn() maybe
[12:42:29] <Famic> Consolas: you have a general confirmation dialog caleld jquery-ui dialog
[12:42:35] <aretmy> maybe fadeOut()
[12:42:39] <Famic> that's not clear what you'd like to do with it
[12:42:41] <Consolas> Famic that is what I'm using
[12:43:01] <Consolas> and I'm loading a customized form that I need to change some values from - action, some fields, etc
[12:43:14] <Famic> Consolas: why not create a new instance ?
[12:43:21] <igcewieling> I tried $('.remote_access').fadeIn(200);  It works fine with no changes if I don't put visibility:hidden for these items
[12:43:43] <Consolas> Famic: I am. And need to change stuff on that instance
[12:43:53] <igcewieling> the chrome javascript debugger does not show any syntax issues.
[12:43:54] <Famic> igcewieling: why do you use visibility in the first place ?
[12:44:13] <Consolas> I thought this would work, for instance the document.forms[0].getElementById['somefield'].value = "teste"
[12:44:27] <Famic> igcewieling: I mean, you could use display or opacity... or .hide()
[12:44:29] <Consolas> but it just does not work, always with the undefined
[12:44:34] <Famic> that handles it best cross browser
[12:44:44] <igcewieling> Famic: If I don't do that then when the page loads these items show for a moment before some JS hides the fields.
[12:45:00] <Famic> igcewieling: probably display:none would work better then
[12:45:00] <igcewieling> If you have suggestions on other ways I'm open to listening
[12:46:11] <Famic> Consolas: what's the link between document.forms[0].getElementById['somefield'].value = "teste" and a dialog box ?
[12:46:25] <igcewieling> Famic: thanks, that seems to have worked.
[12:48:33] <Consolas> well, I have a div which I use as a container
[12:48:39] <Consolas> and I load the file into that div
[12:48:49] <Consolas> so Im with div->div->div-> form
[12:49:06] <Consolas> and this is the only form available at this moment
[12:50:06] <Consolas> maybe is because I've defined that div as a dialog
[12:50:15] <Consolas> Let me try to change values before I defined it as dialog
[12:51:29] <Consolas> nope, must be some different when .load is used
[12:58:06] <anvandare> hmm
[12:58:12] * anvandare re-implemented sortables... poorly
[12:58:23] <anvandare> and this problem just isn't any closer to being solved
[12:58:39] <anvandare> hmm, maybe if i started adding gravity
[12:58:47] <anvandare> any jquery plugins for that?
[12:59:05] <anvandare> (elements fall if they're distant from other elements)
[13:00:26] <Consolas> when loading a file and sending some input json, how do I get this input on the loaded page?
[13:00:45] <Consolas> $("#dialog").load('test.php', { 'config[]':["some_value","blabla"]});
[13:00:59] <Consolas> on test.php, how do I get the config[] ?
[13:06:43] <Whirl3d> quiet channel today, huh? Good afternoon all.
[13:06:54] <Consolas> hell
[13:06:55] <Consolas> o
[13:07:01] <artyom> hi
[13:09:44] <Whirl3d> anybody see devc lately?
[13:09:58] <dabear> Consolas: $_POST in php
[13:10:08] <dabear> $_POST["config"]
[13:10:33] <dabear> Consolas: var_dump($_POST) and you see the values
[13:10:43] <Consolas> yeah,was trying that way
[13:10:50] <Consolas> and jsdecode first
[13:10:53] <Consolas> thanks for the tip
[13:12:04] <Consolas> wow, getting all sort of trash
[13:12:37] <Consolas> honestly didnt expect this would become so difficult
[13:15:08] <Consolas> on firebug, on the response tab  I have <script type="text/javascript">
[13:15:08] <Consolas> console.log('array(2) {
[13:15:08] <Consolas>   [0]=>
[13:15:08] <Consolas>   string(3) "jon"

[13:15:09] <Consolas> </script>
[13:15:10] <Consolas> ops
[13:15:11] <Consolas> sorry guys
[13:15:35] <Consolas> but on console.log I either have empty string or a bunch of garbage lots of it
[13:15:48] <Consolas> have you tried before yo have a customized dialog from jquery ui?
[13:15:57] <kenokabe> Hi, when you simply do  $html = $(html) where html includes ../dummy.img, You've got an weird GET error on chrome, how so? this is so annoying
[13:16:00] <kenokabe> https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1FMew88QikAmkm2eVnaMFHjgUJ8L5T8vWilJBMHkIw5Y
[13:16:01] <Consolas> like a standard confirmation dialog taht you would modified according to the area?
[13:16:04] <kenokabe> like this
[13:16:58] <dabear> kenokabe: that is because you are on a local page, i.e. file://somehtmldoc and you cannot load other resources when doing so
[13:17:14] <dabear> you must be on the http:// or https:// protocols
[13:17:47] <kenokabe> debar yes, I understand the local restriction policy, what I mean is  you just want to handle html document, not access
[13:17:56] <kenokabe> debear sorry
[13:17:57] <dabear> ?
[13:18:09] <kenokabe> I mean
[13:18:36] <kenokabe> I actually don't want to access local resource, however, I manipulate the html document
[13:18:54] <dabear> yep
[13:18:58] <dabear> then move to http://
[13:19:08] <dabear> and the error will be gone
[13:19:50] <Famic> Consolas: the response you get is text. It doesn't get executed
[13:19:50] <kenokabe> well, as I shown in the google doc code, $html = $(html)  occurs the error
[13:19:52] <dabear> or you could always replace the img src from the string
[13:20:17] <kenokabe> debar yes, I am doing that with jquery
[13:20:26] <dabear> kenokabe: that error only happens when the current document is not on http
[13:20:29] <dabear> or https
[13:20:33] <TonkaTruck> Hello jQuery!  How can I fake a resolved deferred?  I have an object method like getThese() and if this.these is populated it just returns that, but if not, it fetches via .ajax().  When this.these is populated I want to "fake" a response.  Is this possible?
[13:20:37] <dabear> and learn to tab
[13:20:44] <kenokabe> the html string is fetched from some site, and I try to remove  ../ img stuff
[13:20:49] <dabear> you haven't actually written my name correct yet
[13:20:51] <dabear> nick*
[13:21:00] <kenokabe> debar sorry again
[13:21:07] <kenokabe> debear sorry again
[13:21:09] <TonkaTruck> I want my client object's .then() to fire just as it would with ajax's resolved deferred.
[13:21:15] <dabear> wtf is it so hard
[13:21:28] <kenokabe> sorry :) my typing
[13:21:40] <dabear> da bear
[13:21:47] <kenokabe> dabear
[13:21:57] <kenokabe> I must be tired..
[13:22:04] <ignivome> Is it possible to have jquery ui's selectable and draggable fn working together?
[13:22:41] <dabear> ?demo @ TonkaTruck
[13:22:42] <bot-t> TonkaTruck, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:22:54] <kenokabe> https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1FMew88QikAmkm2eVnaMFHjgUJ8L5T8vWilJBMHkIw5Y
[13:23:32] <dabear> TonkaTruck: generally, you can just return a promise, that if loaded locally, is pre-resolved
[13:23:46] <dabear> TonkaTruck: any .then handlers will then run immediately
[13:24:01] <kenokabe> dab ear, again, as shown above, to do stuff, I want to handle the fetched html code (../dummy.jpg is included somewhere, and I want to remove it via jquery)
[13:24:02] <TonkaTruck> dabear: ok thanks I was just reading about that.
[13:24:10] <kenokabe> dabear
[13:24:43] <dabear> kenokabe: I have provided the solution to you now two times
[13:25:23] <dabear> you cannot manipulate that contents AND not get that error WHILE you are on a local page
[13:25:26] <ignivome> Someone... Is it possible to have jquery ui's selectable and draggable working together?
[13:27:18] <kenokabe> dab ear , what I want to manipulate is the fetched html code
[13:27:32] <kenokabe> dabear
[13:27:44] <Famic> I thought it was bad ear ^^
[13:28:03] <kenokabe> yeah sorry something is very wrong with my typing
[13:28:08] <pimperle> i'm looking for a way to process the value of an text input field, as soon as a key is pressed. when using .keypress() my handler fires before the character enteres the field.
[13:28:09] <dabear> kenokabe: go to bed. you are not reading or not willing to read what I have typed to you
[13:28:12] <Woet> ignivome: http://www.ryancoughlin.com/2008/11/23/combining-selectables-and-draggables-using-jquery-ui/
[13:28:25] <pimperle> how can i chain my handler *after* the default handler which enters the character
[13:28:35] <Famic> pimperle: try keyup
[13:28:46] <pimperle> i could hack it together with a small set-timeout, but that sounds wrong to me
[13:29:05] <dabear> pimperle: keyup?
[13:29:07] <TonkaTruck> dabear: Oh first answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4869609/how-can-jquery-deferred-be-used
[13:29:12] <pimperle> Famic: hooray
[13:29:25] <pimperle> that should go to the keypress() documentation
[13:29:39] <kenokabe> dabear ok, I need to explain from the first
[13:29:49] <kenokabe> I develop with PhoneGap
[13:30:39] <dabear> kenokabe: then this is a phonegap issue. strip the jquery specific syntax and ask in #phonegap
[13:30:41] <kenokabe> what I'm trying to do is fetch html source from some site via my Google App Engine hosted proxy
[13:30:55] <ignivome> @Woet : Thanks im looking a it right now
[13:31:08] <kenokabe> and the fetching html includes ../.. img stuff
[13:31:44] <kenokabe> I won't access the image directly from jquery, that I can't anyway
[13:33:12] <kenokabe> what I'm trying to do is to change .//some.jpg convert to  http://.…some.jpg with Jquey
[13:33:24] <dabear> kenokabe: this error will be present if you do var container = document.createElement("div"); div.innerHTML = '<img src="../foo.gif">' ?
[13:33:30] <dabear> if so, GO TO #phonegap
[13:34:05] <dabear> container.innerHTML *
[13:34:31] <kenokabe> dab ear yes
[13:34:52] <kenokabe> ok my mac automatically change  dabear to da bear
[13:36:10] <dabear> ?mdc string.replace @ kenokabe
[13:36:11] <bot-t> kenokabe, replace - MDN - Returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement .  The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for e... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[13:36:43] <dabear> kenokabe: either fix the string before passing it to jquery, or go the #phonegap
[13:36:56] <kenokabe> bot-t  dabear yes, looks like I must do that
[13:36:58] <kenokabe> thanks
[13:36:59] <dabear> this error is not related to jquery and should not be asked here
[13:37:36] <kenokabe> but the error occurs on $html = $(html) conversion
[13:38:07] <MoTiOnXml> are the previous live, delegate etc. methods routing to on/off in 1.7?
[13:38:16] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. are we getting the perf. improvement?
[13:38:23] <ajpiano> yes
[13:38:28] <dabear> kenokabe: jquery is just using .innerHTML
[13:38:28] <MoTiOnXml> good stuff
[13:38:49] <kenokabe> hmm
[13:39:55] <kenokabe> thanks in any aspect, dabear
[13:40:50] <Consolas> darn
[13:41:01] <Consolas> this is ridiculous the amount of time I wasted on this
[13:41:03] <Consolas> argh
[13:41:04] <Consolas> eheh
[13:41:37] <ehine1> Could someone take a look at this, I am using jQuery to ensure none of my input boxes in a form are left blank. However, how I have the code now it is only making sure the 1st box is not blank. http://jsfiddle.net/tvxA6/.
[13:42:41] <dabear> ehine1: .val() returns the value of the first element only.
[13:43:07] <dabear> ehine1: there are multiple solutions. the simplest for you to implement, would be to check them all, see ?each for that
[13:43:08] <bot-t> ehine1, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:43:09] <Famic> ehine1: check on .each()(function(){...
[13:43:41] <dabear> ehine1: however there are multiple validation frameworks out there that do this better for you
[13:44:06] <ehine1> alright thanks for the responses, will look into that now.
[13:44:43] <Consolas> Guys, have you guys tried to .load(file) and change sometime the the loaded file ?
[13:52:46] <ehine1> I have used the .each(function) method now, and it's working. But it refreshes the page after I click submit. When I did this with just basic js it did not refresh the page and what was entered into the other form elements did not go away. Any way to change my code to do that with this approach? http://jsfiddle.net/C46hU/
[13:56:57] <molavy> hi
[13:57:24] <molavy> how can i select an id inside current selected element without find
[13:57:54] <molavy> i use this now :$(this).find("#wanted_id")
[13:58:06] <molavy> but is there better selector
[13:58:48] <dabear> ehine1: you are returning from inside the each, while you should return only after the each is run.
[13:59:39] <dabear> molavy: $("#wanted_id") that should work as you should never have duplicate ids inside a document
[14:00:15] <ehine1> dabear: thanks, will give it a try
[14:03:05] <amh345> it's there a way to check where an alerts being called from?   i keep getting my own alert.. but i cant find where it's coming from.  did a find in the entire project.  nothing.
[14:03:40] <molavy> yes , Of course , but , what about class
[14:03:41] <molavy> ?
[14:04:13] <amh345> found it.   cached page.   oy
[14:10:42] <dabear> amh345: use breakpoints and go up in the call stack
[14:11:14] <sgflt> is there a way to automatically bind functions to events of newly created elements of a certain class? i.e. i create a new element with foo = $('<div class="bar"') and an implicit $(foo).bind('click', function() { alert('hello'); }); is run. i *think* i remember seeing some sort of "persistant" query like that, but i can't remember where =/
[14:11:27] <amh345> dabear: thank you.   awesome nick btw.
[14:11:32] <amh345> daaaaabeaaars

[14:12:28] <dabear> sgflt: only works if the content is inserted by jquery
[14:12:30] <sgflt> dabear, thank you
[14:13:32] <amh345> does .live need to be associated with a click/mouse event?  i have some includes that are rendered done with replaceWith.  and i notice that they dont pick up js in my main app.js file.   what is the method for having a $(function() {//} recognize what's in the replaced div?
[14:14:35] <dabear> amh345: .live works with any events. but you need to specify which. if you want to run code when a new elemetn is inserted, see ?livequery

[14:15:31] <dead-index> hey people. I try animating opacity on a div, and it kills that div's z-index - is this known?
[14:15:36] <dead-index> is there a workaround?
[14:15:45] <dabear> ?demo @ dead-index
[14:15:46] <bot-t> dead-index, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:15:53] <amh345> thanks dabears.
[14:16:20] <amh345> having all my js scattered is a real pain.  this should help.
[14:16:22] <dead-index> dabear: while a demo would show the issue - clarify why you are asking for a demo
[14:19:03] <molavy> how can i select an element  inside current selected element without find
[14:19:22] <molavy> i use this now :$(this).find(element)
[14:19:32] <molavy> but is there better selector
[14:20:02] <dabear> dead-index: show what errors
[14:20:29] <dabear> molavy: use find
[14:21:24] <dead-index> dabear: yeah, well there are no errors in js.... and in the demo I put on now, there isn't the same effect. hrm
[14:21:45] <dead-index> any common occurences of z-fighting with animate?
[14:29:50] <dead-index> dabear: yeah it works here... but I just have the same thing but more complex... 0{0-3},1{0-3},2{0-3} in nested z-indexes... weird though
[14:29:52] <dead-index> http://jsfiddle.net/DhTmT/
[14:31:14] <dead-index> jsfiddle is so broken
[14:31:33] <dead-index> save is broken, save, jesus, by design too. It is one thing to have versions but the canonical url should be HEAD
[14:43:23] <ehine1> I'm having soem troubles still with this form validation: want to check is all fields are filled in. Right now it's throwing the alert even when everything is filled in. Can't figure this out :x http://jsfiddle.net/zv2Vb/
[14:51:21] <Famic> ehine1: you lack some basic understanding of how functions return works it seems
[14:54:10] <Famic> for eachinput you are running an anonymous function that returns something which is never used, and checkAllNoFilled returns false in any case
[14:55:16] <ehine1> Famic: is it not looking at each input and checking is they are == "", if at least one is then an alert should be thrown
[14:55:22] <ehine1> I'm not seeing the error in the logic
[14:55:55] <Famic> alert should be thrown yes
[14:56:03] <Famic> but return value doesn't change
[14:56:37] <ehine1> well the alert is being thrown, but even when all inputs are filled in. So are you saying the return false/true shoudl not be present?
[14:57:23] <mnclnode> Hey! If I am Generating a href= values with php, and wish to also execute a OnClick event - which then uses $.ajax Post, why does the POST seem to timeout?
[14:58:09] <Famic> ehine1: you'd be better off by relying on existing validation plugins
[14:58:25] <Famic> your js skills aren't strong enough ;p
[14:59:01] <ehine1> ugh lol, I made it work with just regular js, but when I tried to condense it with jQuery it just doesn't make sense to me lol
[14:59:40] <Famic> dunno why you have an alert when all fields are filled though. I suspect it's because you use :input and the submit button may be among the selected items
[14:59:59] <mnclnode> when using jquery with a elements, must href always be set to #? does anyone know?
[15:00:28] <Famic> mnclnode: href is always better off having a # href than none
[15:00:43] <Famic> not for jquery, but for browsers
[15:00:46] <ehine1> Famic: alright thanks, I'll just put it back to the way I had it with just plain old JavaScript and look into jQuery a bit more
[15:00:50] <Famic> some really don't like having no value in there
[15:01:03] <mnclnode> Famic: Thanks - but what if i want to send the user both to the href and also execute onclick function....
[15:01:14] <TonkaTruck> mnclnode: Don't return false or stop propagation
[15:01:21] <styol> Famic: somethings people use javascript:void(0); but other times people use an actual url or something that would be a fallback for no javascript
[15:01:27] <styol> *sometimes
[15:01:39] <Famic> no js fallback is always good practice
[15:01:51] <Famic> javascript:void(0); sucks
[15:01:53] <mnclnode> so i cannot do both? because when I set the href="#" i can clearly seen in firebug that the post is being sent to php
[15:02:05] <Famic> mnclnode: you can use # or any valid url
[15:02:24] <styol> Famic: woops i used the wrong name ;)
[15:02:36] <TonkaTruck> No js pff.  Just put a <noscript> on your page with 200px text that says SRY, BRO!.  Ideally you should have <blink> on that text, too.
[15:02:37] <mnclnode> Famic: indeed, it sends to the appropriate URL. but the Ajax Post seems to hand...
[15:02:43] <mnclnode> *hang
[15:02:45] <Famic> if you return true after your onlick event, the url will be fetched, not if you return false
[15:03:21] <Famic> TonkaTruck: what about accessibility ?
[15:03:30] <Famic> screen readers for example
[15:03:37] <mnclnode> Famic: Yes it does send to the appropriate href url with the target_blank. but the $.ajax post seems to never get completed.
[15:03:49] <Famic> mnclnode: what are you trying to do ?
[15:03:53] <TonkaTruck> Famic: Good point, better not use blink.
[15:04:09] <Famic> as far as I'm concerned, blink doesn't exist :p
[15:04:26] <mnclnode> Famic: I am trying to make an A tag send the person to a URL in a blank window, then execute a jquery function that will post data to php....
[15:06:02] <mnclnode> Famic: It does send to the appropriate HREF Value always ; but if HREF is not set to #, the $.ajax POST seems to hang... in never reaches the page specified in the url: of ajax.
[15:06:37] <Famic> mnclnode: dos it open in a new tab ?
[15:06:40] <mnclnode> Famic: And this looking at firebug, I do not get a Timeout, I get nothing...
[15:06:49] <mnclnode> Famic: Yes it opens the tab with the proper URL in it...
[15:07:05] <mnclnode> Famic: In firebug under XHR - timeline just has a spinning dial forever.
[15:07:15] <Famic> that sounds odd
[15:07:25] <Famic> got a page we can see ?
[15:07:42] <mnclnode> Sure... http://www.minecraftconnect.com
[15:07:53] <mnclnode> MCC Vote Rewards
[15:08:04] <Famic> need login
[15:08:41] <mnclnode> demo/demo
[15:09:07] <mnclnode> and its when you click on "Cast Vote"
[15:09:47] <Famic> you may want to use tabindex, we need to tab twice to go from login to password input
[15:10:02] <mnclnode> Famic: :) thanks will do
[15:10:39] <TonkaTruck> Yall know a way I can divide an array into two sections at a specific offset?  There's no quick way to do that right?  I have to do it myself.
[15:11:40] <Famic> also, I'dc recommend not altering your markup the way you do. You could have <a href="..." rel="external" class="someid">bla</a> and then make all rel=external link open in new tab, and bind the event from a js file, not onclick
[15:11:54] <destinydriven> how can I rewrite this to have less duplicate code?  http://jsfiddle.net/hJuRj/
[15:12:03] <soulcutter> I'm struggling to remember the pattern for defining a scope in javascript akin to Foo ||= { }
[15:12:40] <Famic> mnclnode: where is the doVote function ?
[15:12:45] <soulcutter> how does that go? Foo = (typeof(Foo) === 'undefined' ? { } : Foo); or something?
[15:12:55] <mnclnode> in the MCC Vote Page
[15:13:10] <Famic> soulcutter: you are talking about ternary ?
[15:13:11] <soulcutter> such a simple stumbling block.. ugh
[15:13:26] <soulcutter> Famic: no, just defining a scope if it does not yet exist
[15:13:31] <soulcutter> I don't want to overwrite a scope that exists
[15:13:53] <soulcutter> it's less a jquery thing, it's a pure javascript thing
[15:14:02] <Famic> mnclnode: I mean in your code
[15:14:22] <mnclnode> Famic: In the head section of the page
[15:14:28] <soulcutter> I saw a blog post on it not too long ago that was exhaustive, but I can't find it
[15:14:29] <TonkaTruck> soulcutter: Your code makes me sad because I wish you would tidy that all up into a pretty object literal and bind it to the form using a plugin bridge.
[15:14:47] <soulcutter> TonkaTruck: har har
[15:15:43] <TonkaTruck> I need to make a series of youtube videos on how not to kill yourself with js.
[15:15:52] <Famic> soulcutter: what you show as an example look alot like a failed ternary syntax. not at all like a closure
[15:16:37] <soulcutter> Famic: failed? what is wrong with it?
[15:16:45] <Famic> nothing, I misread it ;)
[15:16:57] <soulcutter> I'm trying to create a scope if it doesn't already exist
[15:17:04] <soulcutter> maybe scope is the wrong word?
[15:17:10] <Famic> that probably ^^
[15:17:28] <soulcutter> namespace!!
[15:17:32] <soulcutter> that's the word I mean
[15:18:17] <Famic> with your example if Foo is undefined you create it as an empty object... looks quite ok
[15:18:33] <soulcutter> Famic: I wasn't sure if that was the best way to do it
[15:18:38] <soulcutter> it feels a little awkward
[15:19:05] <Famic> nah, it seems neat and tidy ;)
[15:19:52] <soulcutter> sometimes it's hard to tell the difference in js *grin*
[15:20:01] <dshap> hi all, i'm trying to loop through specific div's on my page with .$each() and then set the value of an input element within each of those divs whose name ends with "ORDER".  this is what im using in my $.each() and it's not working:  $(this).find('input[name$="ORDER"]').val('some value')
[15:20:12] <dshap> what am i doing wrong?
[15:20:24] <Famic> mnclnode: do_ajax_vote.php took 430ms. I see nothing xwrong there
[15:20:35] <soulcutter> Famic: thanks for the reassurance though. Guess I'll go with that
[15:20:41] <TonkaTruck> soulcutter: I highly suggest reading this 3, possibly 4 times http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html
[15:20:49] <mnclnode> Famic: Wow strange, and it sent you to the href? Could be a browser problem?
[15:21:07] <Famic> mnclnode: yes, new tab opened too. what browser do you use ?
[15:21:15] <soulcutter> TonkaTruck: that will only take me a few days... :P
[15:21:24] <Famic> lol
[15:21:26] <Famic> indeed
[15:21:27] <mnclnode> Famic: Firefox 7.0.1
[15:21:29] <Famic> looks like a RFC
[15:21:40] <Famic> mnclnode: weird...me too !
[15:21:45] <TonkaTruck> You'll be in here helping people rather than asking for help :)
[15:21:56] <mnclnode> Famic: but, but lol Firebug Claims otherwise....
[15:22:07] <soulcutter> TonkaTruck: like you?
[15:22:22] * soulcutter grins
[15:23:55] <mnclnode> Famic: Firebug XHR -> URL POST do_ajax_vote.php / Status (empty) / Domain minecraftconnect.com / size 0 / remote ip (empty
[15:24:04] <mnclnode> Famic: timeline spinning dial
[15:24:42] <TonkaTruck> soulcutter: I do when I can...usually I don't have time to read tons of code...especially spaghetti.
[15:24:51] <dshap> actually, it is working!  nvm thank you all very much anyways
[15:26:15] <Famic> mnclnode: status: 200 OK size: 20 B remote ip 173.245.61.26:80
[15:26:38] <mnclnode> Famic: strange indeed.. i only get this if i set href="#"
[15:27:25] <Famic> anyway you'd be better off with another syntax to do the same, as explained earlier
[15:27:27] <mnclnode> Famic: Alright I appreciate your help. Its good to know we "can" do what I was trying to do...
[15:27:41] <mnclnode> Famic: Can you point me to some article that describes that process?
[15:28:06] <mnclnode> Famic: This process would work even if I am pulling the HREF from a database with php?
[15:28:12] <Famic> just avoid onclick="" and prefer binding through js file
[15:28:38] <mnclnode> Famic: Ok so i would create a js file with all the code, and then?
[15:30:52] <Famic> mnclnode: somethin glike that http://pastie.org/2817456
[15:33:10] <mnclnode> Famic: Woah! Thanks a Lot!
[15:33:52] <Famic> you're in html5 so you can get the doVote parameters from some meta-data on the element
[15:34:33] <Matt-123321> How would I go about making a timer like on a pennyauction site
[15:35:07] <Famic> Matt-123321: check setTimeout
[15:35:28] <Famic> ?settimeout @ Matt-123321
[15:35:29] <bot-t> Matt-123321, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[15:35:38] <ravenzz> maybe you need more than setTimeout
[15:35:59] <ravenzz> those kind of websites are realtime apps
[15:36:00] <destinydriven> how can I rewrite this to have less duplicate code?  http://jsfiddle.net/hJuRj/
[15:36:07] <Matt-123321> well yeah, but for jquery this is all I'm probably get here
[15:36:59] <ravenzz> because you have to check every second for bids
[15:37:14] <paniq> hey guys
[15:37:34] <paniq> do you know any other implementation for drag & drop except the one from jQuery UI?
[15:37:47] <Matt-123321> Know I would just have to see when there is a bid update
[15:38:01] <Famic> mnclnode: btw I used .live in my example, I believe jquery 1.7 replace it with .on()
[15:38:35] <mnclnode> Famic: I tried... or trying to implement this. Not sure if i have my anchor element correctly.
[15:39:00] <molavy> why this code return error on terrible  IE, $(this).trigger({ type : 'keypress', which : 13 });
[15:39:12] <Famic> mnclnode: you don't need to change the href
[15:39:42] <mnclnode> Famic: Figured that much out... I added as per your recommendation the rel="external" ; which is sweet to learn.
[15:40:08] <mnclnode> Famic: Added an ID of "castvote" - was that correct?
[15:40:19] <Famic> no, you need aclass as you'll have more than one
[15:40:53] <mnclnode> Famic: Why would I need more than one? Can I not just pass along to the same function different PHP Values?
[15:41:14] <Famic> you have several cast button on your page
[15:41:39] <mnclnode> Famic: Correct, but the href is dynamic based on php. and the values are all dynamic - as long as i can pass them to the function
[15:42:13] <mnclnode> Famic: Then my goal is just to post the data to the same php script, and interpret that data there.
[15:42:58] <mnclnode> Famic: I was reading something like you do var something = "<?php echo $var?>" in jquery. is that correct?
[15:43:13] <Famic> that's php, not jquery
[15:43:42] <Famic> js + php injection more accurately
[15:43:45] <mnclnode> Famic: ok, well is it possible to assign php values to javascript values ?
[15:45:19] <Famic> <a class="castvote btn i_facebook_like icon blue" href="http://minecraftservers.net/vote.php?id=8859" data-id="1" data-name="2">Cast Vote!</a>
[15:45:21] <Famic> $(document).ready(function(){
[15:45:23] <Famic> // open external links in new tab/window
[15:45:24] <Famic> damn
[15:45:25] <Famic> $('a[rel*="external"]').live('click',function(){
[15:45:27] <Famic> window.open(this.href, "_blank").focus();
[15:45:29] <Famic> return false;
[15:46:09] <Famic> sorry
[15:46:18] <mnclnode> Famic: Alright this is really cool, let me try this.. I think i am getting the picture.
[15:46:23] <Famic> http://pastie.org/2817456
[15:46:58] <mnclnode> Famic: Woah I am learning some cool stuff,  i appreciate this :) much more logical than what i was going to attempt.
[15:48:12] <Famic> with some corrections : http://pastie.org/2817456
[15:51:51] <mnclnode> Famic: it seems to function, but it is not calling for some reason the $.ajax post
[15:51:58] <Famic> lol
[15:52:08] <Famic> I bet it's work here ;)
[15:52:17] <mnclnode> Famic: lol
[15:54:20] <Famic> it doesn't though
[15:54:39] <mnclnode> Famic: i know my fault
[15:54:50] <mnclnode> Famic: I didn't bother setting data-id and data-name, correcting this now
[15:55:36] <mnclnode> Famic: I see... id is not defined
[15:55:36] <mnclnode> [Break On This Error] data: "id=" + id + "&name=" + name,
[15:59:45] <dyba> Need some help getting my Jasmine specs passing; seems like I'm missing something simple, but I'm not sure
[16:00:06] <dyba> Problem is a div field should be hidden but it shows up as visible
[16:00:13] <dyba> Here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/1329679
[16:00:55] <Famic> dyba wrong chan
[16:01:58] <dyba> Famic: i'm using jQuery with my specs
[16:02:16] <Famic> you have a jasmine problem
[16:02:41] <dyba> Famic: so the jQuery looks fine?
[16:02:53] <Famic> I dunno, I don't read jasmine.
[16:04:07] <dyba> Well, if anyone is interested in checking my jQuery here's the portion: https://gist.github.com/1329679#file_registration.js
[16:05:06] <Famic> dyba: if ( $('[type=checkbox]').is(':checked') )
[16:05:10] <Famic> what are you trying to do here ?
[16:05:47] <dyba> Famic: if the checkbox is not ticked, the div #address_fields should be hidden
[16:05:49] <zamba> hi there.. i have a set of select inputs.. one of the select boxes is for selecting gender.. and whenever that is changed, i need to populate a couple of other selects with values.. how can this be accomplished?
[16:05:54] <Famic> also you can $(this) instead of $("#" + this.id).show();
[16:05:54] <zamba> using .onchange() and ajax?
[16:06:31] <dyba> Famic: I'll try that, thanks!
[16:06:34] <Famic> dyba: the first checkbox found in the dom ?
[16:06:53] <danzik17> dyba: that function doesn't make any sense.  each time you run it, you're going to check every checkbox on the page - you're not filtering that at all
[16:07:13] <dyba> hm, good question, I should probably be more specific in what I'm referencing
[16:07:36] <mnclnode> Famic: It's very strange, does firebug hide by default ; varS?
[16:07:40] <dyba> ok, i'll take a look at the docs and narrow the scope
[16:07:59] <Famic> zamba: sounds like a plan
[16:08:12] <dshap> hey all, what selector would i use if i have a reference to a div with class "someClass" and i want to select the div immediately above it that also has the "someClass" class?  (i have various someClass divs on the page and i want to know how i can select the ones before + after a particular div that i have a reference to)
[16:08:13] <dyba> thanks Famic and danzik17!
[16:08:14] <Famic> mnclnode ?
[16:08:20] <mnclnode> Famic: Because it does go into the .castvote function, but looking at mcc_ajax_vote.js / i cannot see variables
[16:08:36] <mnclnode> Famic: hence why i think this is not working... it keeps on saying that id and name are not defined
[16:08:51] <Famic> dshap: $('.someClass').parent('div')
[16:09:04] <zamba> Famic: ok :)
[16:09:04] <Famic> dshap: $('.someClass').parent('div.someClass')
[16:09:25] <zamba> Famic: or instead of using ajax, just preload the values into the page and select it?
[16:09:36] <Famic> zamba: also good
[16:09:55] <danzik17> dshap: depends what you mean by "immediately above".  is the div a child of what you want to find, or a sibling
[16:10:10] <Famic> zamba: depends on your specifics, there are many options
[16:10:14] <dshap> Famic: not sure i understand...so if i have someClass divs A, B, C, and D (that are displayed on the page in that order)...and i have a variable that is pointing to C, i want to use that variable and select B or D
[16:10:24] <dshap> danzik17: sibling
[16:10:33] <danzik17> dshap: see ?prev
[16:10:34] <bot-t> dshap, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[16:10:37] <dshap> sorry if i wasn't clear before
[16:10:39] <Famic> dshap; I assumed you meant parent
[16:10:49] <dshap> Famic:  my bad, wasn't clear
[16:11:18] <Famic> mnclnode: I made a quick test, what I pasted should work
[16:11:50] <dshap> danzik17: looks like what im looking for, thanks!
[16:12:18] <mnclnode> Famic: I get a console error that tells me that id, name is not defined. Aborts execution on line 14 of what you have pasted.
[16:12:39] <danzik17> mnclnode: try using .data('id') rather than attr to get at those values
[16:12:58] <mnclnode> danzik: Thanks a lot, will try.
[16:13:14] <Famic> danzik17: are you sure that leads to the same thing ?
[16:13:47] <danzik17> Famic: leads to a better thing - .data will automatically read data- attrs and store the results in the .data cache for that object, so future queries are much faster
[16:13:57] <Famic> ok cool
[16:14:02] <danzik17> and i forget if .attr with "-" in it tries to camel case or not
[16:14:07] <Famic> anyway I tested the .attr('data-id') and it works fine in my example
[16:16:52] <Famic> mnclnode: actually I think your problem is serverside
[16:17:09] <mnclnode> Famic: Lol you see now huh...
[16:17:18] <mnclnode> Famic: i tried removing the "-" same problem
[16:17:19] <Famic> previously you had DoVote(1,2), now you have DoVote(data1, datat2)
[16:17:37] <Famic> you need the -
[16:18:33] <Famic> if you look in firebug console you'll see the ajax query triggers fine, it just never gets a response
[16:18:33] <dyba> /pd/// /p/ppd/nw
[16:18:35] <mnclnode> Famic: I cannot do things like name="SomeName" someid="SomeID" - then just amend the in Javascript?
[16:18:39] <dyba> woops
[16:18:47] <Famic> mnclnode: nope
[16:19:00] <Famic> data- is the only valid way to have custom attributes in html5
[16:19:02] <aximilation> kblake: long time no see
[16:19:11] <mnclnode> Famic: Then lol I am not sure what is going on... Everytime I look in firebug, int he Console it claims id is not defined line 15
[16:19:12] <mnclnode> *14
[16:19:38] <Famic> add alert(id); right after where it's set
[16:19:46] <Famic> or console.log
[16:20:02] <Famic> no wait
[16:20:05] <Famic> that's useless
[16:20:18] <mnclnode> Famic: I know because it doesn't seem to wish to set it in the first place.
[16:20:23] <kblake> aximilation: ha. ya. no doubt
[16:20:29] <Famic> firebug console tells you it sends the right params to the ajax req
[16:20:38] <Famic> id	data1
[16:20:38] <Famic> name	datat2
[16:20:48] <Famic> in the POST tab
[16:21:31] <Famic> nevermind, not anymore now
[16:21:34] <mnclnode> Famic: Well I am looking at firebug Console-> Errors Tab. It states id is not defined
[16:22:21] <Famic> mnclnode: you set the markup to data-1 and data-2
[16:22:36] <mnclnode> Famic: Yes Sir. Now that I know that it is only valid to do data-
[16:22:37] <Famic> how do you expect the js to find data-id and data-name ?!
[16:22:55] <Famic> also, I'm not sure numbers are valid here
[16:23:22] <mnclnode> Famic: Ok so in the markup it should be like so? data-name, data-something, etc....
[16:23:42] <Famic> of course... jeez, I pasted a working example >:P
[16:23:58] <Famic> data-whatever
[16:24:20] <Famic> and on the js side, use the method danzik17 spoke about, it's better
[16:24:41] <Famic> .data('id') instead of .attr('data-id')
[16:25:33] <mnclnode> Famic: so it would on the js side something like:  var id = that.data('data-something');
[16:26:00] <Famic> yeah, well... data-id seems a good pick for that one ;)
[16:26:13] <Famic> but you have the idea
[16:26:27] <mnclnode> Famic: no, i get the same error all the time in my firebug console ;
[16:26:55] <mnclnode> Famic: Could it be on the JS side, the $(document).ready?
[16:27:06] <destinydriven> goodnight all
[16:27:21] <Famic> mnclnode: you are tired
[16:27:29] <Famic> you need some sleep :p
[16:27:44] <mnclnode> Famic: Plus in firebug if i follow the error, it brings me to the mcc_ajax_vote.js and i do not see the var in there
[16:28:00] <mnclnode> Famic: Does firebug hide var in js files?
[16:28:11] <D_Roch> Hey does anyone know why I can't access my markersArray from my add markerFunction : http://pastebin.com/wgWKLnXV
[16:28:16] <Famic> there is var id = that.attr('data-id'); in mcc_ajax_vote.js and data-serverseccode="datat2" data-serverid="data1" in the markup
[16:28:38] <Famic> if you don't use the same name in markup and in js, js won't find the data (obviously)
[16:29:07] <mnclnode> Famic: never lol! i changed it to     var id = that.data('data-serverid');
[16:29:28] <mnclnode> Famic: ohhh wait lol i think i know what is going on.... welcome to cloudfare
[16:29:47] <D_Roch> Famic: so it should be this way ? : markersArray: [],
[16:30:52] <Famic> D_Roch; I didn't say anything, but it looks like a good guess
[16:31:26] <mnclnode> Famic: Awesome! Thanks. It works lol, no more console errors but the spinning timeline. Ok I will assume it all works.
[16:31:36] <mnclnode> Famic: Let us thank cloudfare for caching stuff during development.
[16:32:32] <Famic> why do you use a cdn during development ? :p
[16:32:58] <mnclnode> Famic: Dunno because i did not follow best-practices and decided to do development on a production web server lol
[16:33:32] <mnclnode> Famic: The thing is so darn complex, that it kind of had to be done that way. I cannot develop on another machine because i need to xdebug live on all these remote mysql minecraft server databases.
[16:33:50] <Famic> mnclnode: you need that.data('serverid'); instead of that.data('data-serverid');
[16:34:22] <Famic> then you should be alright
[16:35:14] <mnclnode> Famic: I changed it. Can you see if it works? Because for me, I have the same spinning XHR problem in firebug.
[16:35:32] <mnclnode> Famic: What version of firebug are you using?
[16:36:32] <Famic> I also have the spinning wheel, but the request seems ok, it's now the server not responding
[16:36:44] <Famic> you had numerical values before, string values with a typo now
[16:36:47] <Famic> I suppose that's why
[16:37:17] <mnclnode> Famic: What are the markup accepted format? can i do stuff like data-sec_token=""
[16:37:38] <Famic> you're gonna have to chekc the specs on that
[16:37:58] <mnclnode> Famic: Ok what is it called? lol is this HTML5, JavaScript Related?
[16:38:09] <Famic> it's a html5 feature
[16:38:38] <mnclnode> Famic: Thanks! HTML5 Custom Data Atrributes... soo fancy lol
[16:50:36] <mnclnode> Famic: Using that.data('') does not function. Using that.attr('') does function. I added Alert Box to test.
[16:51:11] <Famic> mnclnode: you need that.data('serverid'); instead of that.data('data-serverid');
[16:51:21] <mnclnode> Famic: I tried with both.
[16:51:43] <Famic> well maybe danzik17 was wrong then
[16:52:02] <Famic> ot you need a more recent version of jquery
[16:52:15] <mnclnode> Famic: As well by the way. Doing that.attr('secToken') returns Undefined. Using that.attr('data-secToken') works
[16:52:36] <Famic> yeah, with .attr you need the data- part
[16:52:53] <mnclnode> Famic: The only thing is the POST :(
[16:53:06] <Famic> you had numerical values before, string values with a typo now
[16:53:24] <mnclnode> Famic: What do you mean?
[16:53:40] <Famic> you had DoVote(1,2) before
[16:54:07] <mnclnode> Famic: Well I am using your method now...
[16:54:17] <danzik17> data- attributes have worked with .data since 1.4.3
[16:54:23] <Famic> now you have the equivalent of DoVote("data1","datat2")
[16:54:35] <mnclnode> Famic: no, refresh
[16:55:26] <mnclnode> danzik17: It is strange... but it does not seem to work for me :( and I am using Jquery 1.6
[16:55:44] <danzik17> mnclnode: http://jsfiddle.net/qCsEn/
[16:56:18] <Famic> mnclnode: the ajax request is fine, your problem lies on the php side now
[16:56:38] <mnclnode> Famic: So you do not get the silly spinning dial in firebug?
[16:56:46] <Famic> I do
[16:57:04] <mnclnode> Famic: Does that not mean that it is never posting to PHP?
[16:57:07] <Famic> the server is not responding
[16:57:23] <mnclnode> Famic: well.... lol ... I am not sure about that
[16:57:39] <mnclnode> Famic: What should I return from PHP to trigger the success: event in the javascript function?
[16:57:45] <Famic> what is in do_ajax_vote.php ?
[16:58:02] <mnclnode> Famic: return true; echo "test";
[16:58:19] <Famic> ?
[16:58:30] <mnclnode> Famic: Those are the two lines in do_ajax_vote.php
[16:58:47] <Famic> do_ajax_vote.php needs to begin with <?php
[16:58:57] <mnclnode> Famic: well sir that was implied
[16:59:04] <Famic> one never knows
[16:59:17] <Famic> now try removing the return
[16:59:30] <Famic> see if the echo is seen by xhr
[16:59:49] <mnclnode> Famic: negative, same spinning XHR
[17:00:19] <mnclnode> Famic: I am sure I have seen this behavior before, I just cannot recall what the solution was.
[17:00:47] <Famic> check your .ajax syntax
[17:01:08] <mnclnode> Famic: I copied directly from pastebin
[17:01:20] <Famic> which was copied from your code... I didn't check any of this
[17:01:54] <Famic> it was working for me though, but the best thing to do now is to check the .ajax doc and make sure you're doing it right
[17:06:28] <mnclnode> Famic: Ok if i had a return false;  after $.ajax it posts. but does not open the URL. Would you know why?
[17:07:18] <Famic> of course
[17:07:50] <Famic> weird thing is that without return false the page should change to the href link
[17:08:28] <Famic> so what should happen is ajax trigger then change of page
[17:08:50] <mnclnode> Famic: you mean _blank page?
[17:08:56] <Famic> we have neverending ajax request and no change of page, that I don't know why
[17:09:12] <Famic> anyhow, you want the return false
[17:09:34] <mnclnode> Famic: Ok the return false is there...
[17:10:24] <mnclnode> Famic: but why is it not triggering the "external" should that not be triggered before the $.ajax?
[17:11:45] <Famic> .live is deprecated I believe, so first replace it with .on()
[17:11:59] <Famic> (I dunno the correct way to use it, just read about it earlier)
[17:12:38] <mnclnode> Famic: how can i place the external new tab/window code in a function? is it function openLink() {}
[17:12:59] <Famic> it might be best not to use the rek="external" and just make the same thing within the .castvote click function
[17:13:24] <Famic> window.open(this.href, "_blank").focus(); doesn't need a function around it :p
[17:13:35] <Famic> it's simple enough as it is
[17:14:02] <mnclnode> Famic: My logic was to wrap it into a function and fire up that function the $.ajax success:
[17:14:18] <Famic> you don't need a wrapper
[17:14:52] <Famic> and you may not want the user to wait for the ajax call to return in order to show him a new page
[17:15:00] <mnclnode> Famic: Yes Sir! It works!
[17:15:18] <mnclnode> Famic: Placing window.open - in the castvote worked, and it posted.
[17:15:33] <mnclnode> Famic: The only strange thing is that i see it open a tab in Mozilla, but it does not give it focus.
[17:16:02] <Famic> maybe the alert take the focus back
[17:16:37] <mnclnode> Famic: The man with all answers, yes that was the problem.
[17:17:08] <Famic> goody
[17:17:33] <mnclnode> Famic: or not lol, it does not post the data. it is like it stops at window.open
[17:17:33] <Famic> now you can make some cleanup and hop to another issue ;)
[17:17:45] <Famic> what data ?
[17:18:03] <mnclnode> Famic: It does not perform the $.ajax
[17:18:20] <Famic> it does
[17:18:25] <Famic> and it gets "test" as a response
[17:19:18] <mnclnode> Famic: hmmm yes indeed. why does it not appear under XHR?
[17:19:35] <Famic> ?
[17:19:44] <Famic> it does
[17:19:50] <mnclnode> Famic: I see it in firebug under console, but no under Net->XHR
[17:20:08] <Famic> maybe because it was not open at the time you made the request
[17:28:57] <mnclnode> Famic: woah this is cool lol - love jquery. Do you know how i can make a simple timer?
[17:29:20] <Famic> ?setTimeout
[17:29:20] <bot-t> var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[17:29:22] <fris> i have a class <div class="tweets widget"> this doesnt seem to work jQuery(".tweets widget")
[17:29:37] <Famic> jQuery(".tweets.widget")
[17:30:00] <fris> thx
[17:34:44] <s5fs> I'm using jquery mobile and I'm struggling with changePage(). I've got three pages and I'm using the tap() event to call changePage(). However, the navigation keeps getting lost, loading the wrong page, etc. Any advice is welcomed.
[17:35:45] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: why are you doing that instead of just using links?
[17:37:24] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: I want to use my own custom validation before changing pages. If there is an easier way, I'm totally down for that.
[17:37:48] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: ah, k
[17:39:06] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: Do you know of a way to tie into the existing navigation easily? I figured changePage was the next best approach, short of a code review anyways.
[17:39:24] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: you're doing form validation?
[17:39:49] <ryanneufeld> I haven't worked with jquery mobile in a while
[17:40:05] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: Example. I have a 5-step "form", each step needs some sort of validation.
[17:41:15] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: well, you could use a form, and then use some click bindings to change hidden fields, and then post it when they are done?
[17:41:52] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: I'm not struggling with validation (yet), just the page navigation.
[17:42:20] <ryanneufeld> sorry man, I'm not much help there
[17:43:03] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: For the form data itself I've got a little object that persists across pages. Nothing special. :-D
[17:43:30] <ryanneufeld> cool
[17:45:05] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: Yeah man, I'm not sure what the deal is. I'm literally using a tap() event and executing changePage(). It's 3 lines of code, both for front and back buttons. Seems like it should "just work" haha!
[17:45:23] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: I think you should use click instead for one
[17:45:59] <ryanneufeld> jquerymobile aliases click events with tap events
[17:46:20] <ryanneufeld> I might be wrong, I dunno :p
[17:47:22] <sahbeewah> how exactly does the navigation get lost?
[17:47:55] <s5fs> sahbeewah: Moving forward and backward confuses it. Let me try real fast and I'll give you better pageflow.
[17:48:06] <s5fs> sahbeewah: I'm also happy to post if you wish
[17:49:33] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ s5fs
[17:49:33] <bot-t> s5fs, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:49:47] <s5fs> sahbeewah: Example: P1, Next (fine). P2, Next (fine). P3, Back (fine). P2, Back (fine). P1, Next (goes to Page 3!)
[17:50:10] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: Thx. I'll try jsfiddle real quick
[17:50:20] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: With 3 pages I don't know easy it is to mock there tho :-/
[17:51:05] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: good point
[17:51:07] <ryanneufeld> hadn't thought of that
[17:52:09] <s5fs> Lemme clean up my example and post it :-)

[17:55:13] <MW__> Hello, I have a small problem with loading images in ui, when i use classes ui-content and so on i don't get background image - firebug says: 'Can't load given url' - Then renaming it on the fly from
[17:55:28] <MW__> images/blabla.jpg to /images/blabla.jpg works fine
[17:55:33] <dyba> ryanneufeld: I didn't know there was a seen function in irc

[17:56:13] <tharkun> How do i test the client to see if they have javascript running?
[17:56:41] <dyba> s5fs: does it belong to anyone? I'm curious. I may be asking dumb questions
[17:57:29] <ryanneufeld> dyba: does it matter?
[17:57:35] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: you can't
[17:57:50] <NickRamage> Can anyone tell me why my home page script won't run when the url bar says mysite.com but it runs when it says mysite.com/home? The site is precorcfs.com. The script is in js/home.js. Thank you.
[17:58:18] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: you'd need javascript. you could put a tracking pixel in a noscript tag to log it on the server side, but it would be complicated to do that within a session
[17:59:29] <tharkun> ryanneufeld: is there a simple way to tell the user to turn on javascript for an app to work properly?
[17:59:37] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: no
[17:59:42] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: yes
[18:00:06] <tharkun> ryanneufeld: How?
[18:00:07] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: I meant yes, you can use the <noscript> tag to show some content
[18:00:19] <ryanneufeld> OR, you can use modernizr, an some CSS rules

[18:03:45] <MW__> Anyone?
[18:03:50] <MW__> :)
[18:04:15] <ryanneufeld> MW__: sounds like you need to edit the css?
[18:04:49] <MW__> Ok, will give it a shot now, cause smth seems not legit.
[18:05:58] <ryanneufeld> MW__: well, think about it
[18:06:06] <ryanneufeld> if you're changing the url when you inspect it
[18:06:08] <ryanneufeld> and you're adding a /
[18:06:55] <tharkun> ryanneufeld: the thing i most liked about your link was the peanut :)
[18:07:04] <ryanneufeld> then clearly either you're outputting the wrong code (not a jquery problem) or you need to update the jquery-ui css to look wherever you placed the images on your envirionment
[18:07:16] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: peanut?
[18:07:30] <MW__> I placed them in the folder which is located in the file using jquery
[18:07:43] <MW__> public/myfile
[18:07:49] <MW__> public/images/blabla.jpg
[18:08:11] <ryanneufeld> MW__: check the css
[18:08:20] <ryanneufeld> replace images/ with /images/ and see what happens
[18:08:48] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: oh, I see, yeah, I just ate a bunch of those
[18:08:48] <jscheel_> hey guys, running into something kinda weird... when I call animate() (or any function that uses animate), the animation doesn't do anything for a sec, then picks up mid animation. For example, if I animate({left: "100"}, 6000), then nothing happens for about 2 seconds, then the animation jumps to about 30% and completes normally.
[18:08:50] <ryanneufeld> was awesome
[18:09:19] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ jscheel_
[18:09:19] <bot-t> jscheel_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:12:14] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: it's part of a larger backbone project, so it's not easily fiddled, but the actual call is pretty simple: http://jsfiddle.net/QFAGH/
[18:13:20] * ryanneufeld looks
[18:13:30] <MW__> Thank Ryan Neufeld, that worked feel, newer version of ui has the proper path. Cheers
[18:13:42] <ryanneufeld> MW__: np
[18:13:45] <MW__> well* ofc
[18:13:54] <ryanneufeld> jscheel_: that code isn't enough for me to help you with
[18:14:42] <ryanneufeld> jscheel_: my thoughts would be that if you're seeing a delay it could be environmental (ie your computer), or some other code you have in backbone is causing a delay
[18:14:52] <ryanneufeld> jscheel_: does it do the same in all browsers?
[18:15:19] <mnclnode> .seen famic
[18:15:20] <hsbot> famic was seen 45 minutes and 42 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: jQuery(".tweets.widget")
[18:19:20] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: hmm, happening in chrome pretty bad, even after I restarted it, not happening too much in firefox though
[18:19:21] <jscheel_> wierd
[18:19:46] <ryanneufeld> ie/safari?
[18:21:21] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: no prob. in safari, can't test on ie yet
[18:21:34] <ryanneufeld> check your chrome version
[18:21:37] <jscheel_> well, not gonna matter anyways, cause I'm on a mac
[18:21:42] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:25:25] <daveyjoe> Has jQuery announced when they will drop support for IE6?
[18:27:16] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: sorry, wife was blowing up the kitchen. Chrome v. 17.0.928.0
[18:27:44] <ryanneufeld> jscheel_: you're running dev channel
[18:27:54] <ryanneufeld> jscheel_: try a stable version, see if you have problems
[18:28:01] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: k
[18:28:02] <jscheel_> thanks
[18:28:07] <ryanneufeld> if you don't then I would make a reduced test case, and submit a bug report
[18:28:22] <ryanneufeld> jscheel_: you might have found a legitimate bug :)
[18:28:51] <ryanneufeld> but it doesn't appear to be your code causing the problem
[18:29:14] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: cool, I'll download stable and try it out later tonight (after I prevent any more kitchen explosions). Thanks again!
[18:29:20] <ryanneufeld> haha
[18:29:23] <ryanneufeld> good luck
[18:29:57] <jscheel_> thanks
[18:30:17] <ryanneufeld> np
[18:45:10] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: ah, found it
[18:45:26] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: the animate happens after a confirm dialog
[18:45:55] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: without the confirm dialog, it works fine, with the dialog, it messes up
[18:46:10] <ryanneufeld> jscheel_: nice
[18:46:13] <ryanneufeld> glad you found it
[18:46:24] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: yeah, now if I just knew why
[18:46:25] <ryanneufeld> I don't know anything about backbone, or which dialog you're using
[18:46:38] <ryanneufeld> so I can't be much more help there sorry
[18:46:40] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: no, it's a native confirm dialog
[18:46:48] <ryanneufeld> ew
[18:47:02] <ryanneufeld> that could be why?
[18:47:04] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: well, plans are to change it later, just prototyping right now
[18:47:18] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: but why would a native confirm dialog do that to an animation
[18:47:33] <ryanneufeld> cause its' blocking
[18:47:51] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: but the animate isn't called until the dialog is confirmed
[18:48:10] <ryanneufeld> dunno man
[18:49:30] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: oh, wait, that's not the bug. Huh, it's actually another animation that happens on another element
[18:50:14] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: I call hide() on a tooltip inside of the element, then confirm, then I animate the element
[18:50:43] <ryanneufeld> ?hide
[18:50:43] <bot-t> .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[18:50:57] <ryanneufeld> hide can take a callback and durration
[18:51:09] <ryanneufeld> so maybe the callback is where you want to use the confirm
[18:51:18] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: nope, I think I get it now. chrome supports requestAnimationFrame, right?
[18:51:28] <ryanneufeld> not sure
[18:51:32] <ryanneufeld> but not all browsers do
[18:51:38] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: chrome is pausing the hide animation when the dialog comes up
[18:51:46] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: effectively queueing the other animation
[18:51:56] <jscheel_> because focus is lost
[18:52:00] <ryanneufeld> can you paste the code snippet that does thaty?
[18:52:03] <ryanneufeld> *that?
[18:52:38] <jscheel_> hah, that was the issue
[18:53:03] <ryanneufeld> ?
[18:53:10] <ryanneufeld> confirm was blocking?
[18:53:46] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: yes, because it takes focus off the window that held the animation
[18:54:22] <ryanneufeld> it's blocking because it's designed to halt your code for a user response
[18:54:45] <ryanneufeld> what you can do is chain some callbacks
[18:55:27] <ryanneufeld> so .hide(500,function(){ if(confirm()){$(this).animate();}});
[18:55:48] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: yeah, def. didn't even think about confirm blocking all script execution
[18:56:01] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: not a long term solution anyways, but dang that was annoying
[18:56:05] <jscheel_> ryanneufeld: thanks!
[18:56:08] <ryanneufeld> np
[18:56:21] <jscheel_> ok, now I must go prevent kitchen disasters

[19:08:58] <Consolas> hey guys
[19:12:48] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: hi
[19:22:19] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: after debugging a little bit, it appears that there is a bug in jquery mobile. i'm watching the urlHistory array grow oddly when navigating between pages (after moving backwards down the stack)
[19:22:53] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: while it's possible, I'm skeptical of your conclusion
[19:23:30] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i'm skeptical as well!
[19:24:11] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[19:27:57] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: would you mind taking a brief look?
[19:28:10] <ryanneufeld> I can try
[19:28:11] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: at the very least confirming my own behaviors. i'm on chrome
[19:28:31] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: thanks, I'm PM'd ya
[19:28:54] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: so navigate from page 1 to page 3, then turn around, go back to page 1, then try to make it back to page 3.
[19:29:58] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: hmm, looks like a pushstate bug
[19:30:40] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: well, i'm glad it's not just me, then
[19:30:55] <ryanneufeld> Well, I can see that something unexpected is happening
[19:31:09] <ryanneufeld> whether or not that is JQM or not I don't know
[19:31:35] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: the actual code is dead simple, it's frustrating, haha
[19:31:58] <ryanneufeld> where is your JS code?
[19:33:14] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: in the script tags inside the indexPage div. that's it.
[19:33:23] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i'm binding to tap, calling changePage. that's it.
[19:33:32] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[19:34:08] <ryanneufeld> does it work differently if you bind to click()? also you're not doing an event.preventPropigation or return false; (need one of the two)
[19:34:20] <ryanneufeld> so you're letting jQM also grab the click event on the links
[19:34:38] <ryanneufeld> are you minifying your code?
[19:34:42] <ryanneufeld> or are you just typing it that way?
[19:34:51] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: no, what you see is what i'm working with currently
[19:34:52] <ryanneufeld> cause if it's the second, stop it, untill you're done
[19:35:16] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: yeah, i've had enough issues with min'd code to finish testing w/o it. i switched to the non-min'd jquery mobile to debug.
[19:35:17] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: format your code dude, it will make finding bugs SOOOOOOOOOOOO much easier
[19:35:28] <ryanneufeld> I mean your code in the html
[19:35:31] <ryanneufeld> the stuff you wrote
[19:35:32] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: apache is stripping my formatting, it's a dev box
[19:35:39] <ryanneufeld> oic
[19:35:41] <ryanneufeld> k
[19:36:10] <ryanneufeld> try adding return false; at the end of your tap functions
[19:36:21] <sahbeewah> is there any way to use the value of a variable as the key in an object literal?
[19:36:34] <ryanneufeld> sahbeewah: yup

[19:36:51] <svcghost> I'm trying to change the size of an element depending on if the user changes the size
[19:36:53] <svcghost> of the page
[19:36:55] <svcghost> i mean browser window
[19:37:07] <ryanneufeld> svcghost: media queries, and there is a resize plugin out there as well
[19:37:18] <ryanneufeld> svcghost: I would do that with CSS instead
[19:37:24] <ryanneufeld> svcghost: media queries
[19:37:44] <svcghost> CSS can't detect if the window size changes
[19:37:54] <ryanneufeld> svcghost: yes it can

[19:39:26] <ryanneufeld> s5fs: how did you make out?
[19:39:49] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: return false didn't help :-/ checking click() next. i'm slow, my girl brought me chocolate cake, haha!
[19:40:31] <sahbeewah> ryanneufeld: what i meant was something along these lines: var testTop = "top"; $("#box").animate({ testTop: "+=10" });
[19:41:07] <ryanneufeld> sahbeewah: I gotcha, sec I'll show you
[19:43:25] <ryanneufeld> sahbeewah:  http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/9qSwb/
[19:44:00] <svcghost> ryanneufeld: i see u can use mediaqueries to check if the window is a specific size, but I am trying to change the element size whenever the window size is change at all
[19:44:00] <aghouseh> anyone have suggestions on trying to show a remote piece of HTML locally? im trying to load it via ajax but since its off-site, it wont work. i could get it with php and dump it into a hidden div, but that seems very sloppy.

[19:50:12] <Consolas> this would be a confirmation form
[19:50:19] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: I would get the form you want

[19:56:09] <svcghost> sorry, noob here
[19:57:06] <htoothrot> is there an obvious reason i'm overlooking for not seeing an error in firebug when trying to use an undefined name?
[19:57:07] <Consolas> ryanneufeld: so your advice would be getting the dialog object and then apped the form, already changed?
[19:57:16] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: yes
[19:57:25] <ryanneufeld> svcghost: yes
[19:57:26] <Consolas> I would have to load the form somehow cause I do not include it in the document
[19:57:45] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: get it with .load then is fine
[19:57:59] <ryanneufeld> but before you append it, modify it, then before you show the dialog

[20:00:20] <ryanneufeld> htoothrot: you can filter what it shows, but without seeing the code I can't really guess. I personally have no idea beyond that
[20:01:09] <s5fs> MJ1982: if you want jsfiddle to interpret php code for you, i'm not sure it will.
[20:01:54] <MJ1982> s5fs: Hmm..... this is gonna make my learning a bit tough. :/  Need to use a sample array to test it
[20:02:10] <htoothrot> it was of the variety: function(foo) { for(var i=0;i<bar.length;i++) { .. } }
[20:02:19] <htoothrot> i have javascript errors enabled
[20:02:21] <s5fs> MJ1982: you could run the php somewhere else, copy the generated array and paste that in
[20:03:20] <MJ1982> well I need to test if I can even "convert" the php array over properly with JSON.  Need jQuery to pick up the array results and display things depending on what comes back
[20:03:40] <svcghost> ryanneufeld: last question. is it pretty resource intensive on the user's machine when you use onresize?
[20:03:48] <svcghost> to change the height of a div
[20:04:29] <ryanneufeld> MJ1982: php.net/json_encode
[20:04:39] <ryanneufeld> svcghost: I think so yeah
[20:05:07] <MJ1982> ryanneufeld: yeah. thats it. I just need to see if all these things work together.  Sadly jsfiddle doesnt let you add php as a possible pane
[20:05:13] <ryanneufeld> svcghost: http://paulirish.com/2009/throttled-smartresize-jquery-event-handler/
[20:05:28] <ryanneufeld> MJ1982: they do
[20:05:31] <Consolas> ryanneufeld: thanks buddy but thats is preciselly the problem
[20:05:36] <ryanneufeld> MJ1982: I use them every day
[20:05:41] <Consolas> Im trying to change the content
[20:05:43] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: np
[20:05:54] <Consolas> with either $('#dialog').form.getelement
[20:05:59] <MJ1982> use what?
[20:06:10] <Consolas> or document.forms[0].getElementById['field']
[20:06:10] <Consolas> etc
[20:06:20] <Consolas> and just doesnt work - maybe its becuase I use .load?
[20:06:21] <ryanneufeld> MJ1982: json_encode and ajax. Set your dataType to json
[20:06:31] <ryanneufeld> and data will be an object in your callback
[20:06:53] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: $.load('url/to/thinh').find(
[20:07:03] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: $.load('url/to/thinh').find('form').doStuffWithIt()
[20:07:32] <ryanneufeld> MJ1982: also, jsfiddle has some ajax endpoints you can play with, check the left side
[20:08:05] <MJ1982> Yeah. I think Im only usin AJAX. Just aa guess.
[20:08:23] <Consolas> ryanneufeld will try that
[20:08:36] <Consolas> thanks a lot
[20:09:23] <ryanneufeld> MJ1982: in your php 'echo json_encode($myArrayOrObject)'
[20:10:28] <ryanneufeld> MJ1982: in your ajax: $.ajax({url:'path/to/script/that/echos',dataType:'json'}).done(function(data){ data.myArrayIndexOrObjectMember });
[20:10:31] <MJ1982> ryanneufeld: Rght. In the final prooduct im working with, the array is generated dynamically through an admin screen.  So, for now/for JSFiddle.. that is why I needed to create a sample array
[20:11:12] <ryanneufeld> MJ1982: k, also you know you can see the contents of what's returned in fire bug by looking at the XHR?
[20:11:59] <MJ1982> ryanneufeld: Yeah.  Kind of.  Just using what qtip2's page had as a "sandbox"
[20:12:09] <IanWizard-Cloud_> How should I store arbitrary data in a tag?  I've always used rel up to now, but I don't feel that's right.
[20:12:48] <IanWizard-Cloud_> Alternatively, I'd like to store it as part of a class name, but I can't figure out how best to access that with jQuery.
[20:14:07] <ryanneufeld> ?.data() @ IanWizard-Cloud_
[20:14:16] <ryanneufeld> ?.data() @IanWizard-Cloud_
[20:14:18] <IanWizard-Cloud_> say I have class="class class myClass-data class"  How would I A). Match anything that has a class starting with myClass, and B. isolate the string for just that class, so that I can parse out the data
[20:14:34] <ryanneufeld> bot-t: yt?
[20:15:02] <ryanneufeld> IanWizard-Cloud_: read the jquery docs regarding .data() and selectors
[20:15:48] <IanWizard-Cloud_> ryanneufeld: I need to be able to hard code it into the html.  Perhaps data() lets me do that, I'll look.
[20:16:01] <ryanneufeld> IanWizard-Cloud_: read the docs I just told you about
[20:16:09] <ryanneufeld> IanWizard-Cloud_: It's all there man
[20:16:18] <IanWizard-Cloud_> ryanneufeld: ^^ "...I'll look."
[20:16:23] <IanWizard-Cloud_> ryanneufeld: :)
[20:16:33] <IanWizard-Cloud_> ryanneufeld: thx

[20:24:13] <Consolas> ryanneufeld if I just can push your good will a little more
[20:25:21] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: when you ask like that, how can I say no?
[20:26:27] <Consolas> http://jsfiddle.net/DnPN7/2/
[20:26:32] <Consolas> ryanneufeld eheheh
[20:27:23] <Consolas> such a simple thing, I though in the beginning and now its been like 4 days and just don't see any improvements
[20:27:31] <Consolas> I just cant change the loaded file values
[20:27:42] <ryanneufeld> Consolas: if you want an id
[20:27:54] <ryanneufeld> $('#confirm_box')
[20:30:35] <ryanneufeld> I'm off
[20:32:13] <Consolas> Im totally lost here
[20:33:10] <s5fs> Consolas: whats up
[20:33:28] <s5fs> Consolas: you're .load()'ing content and then you want to manipulate it, yes?
[20:33:37] <Consolas> yes, thats exactly it
[20:33:50] <Consolas> One could think this is easy, I for one thought it was going to be a walk in the park
[20:33:57] <Consolas> tried so many different things
[20:34:07] <s5fs> Consolas: okay, so lets try some simple tests first. after you load the page, can you populate an element and select it?
[20:34:14] <Consolas> I just one to have a generic dialog and I though that the load and change loaded form would be a good way
[20:34:32] <Consolas> that is the thing: Im trying to change, for instance, a value on a textfield
[20:34:35] <Consolas> and I just cant
[20:34:47] <Consolas> it keeps outputing not defined and not a function
[20:34:54] <bot-t> Consolas, jQuery API - Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/#foo").load("url.php", function(data) { $(this).find(".something").val("bar"); });
[20:34:54] <bot-t> Consolas, $("#foo").load("url.php", function(data) { $(this).find(".something").val("bar"); });
[20:34:54] <bot-t> Consolas, $("#foo").load("url.php", function(data) { $(this).find(".something").val("bar"); });
[20:35:01] <Consolas> ryan was cool enough to give me a tip
[20:35:03] <Consolas> to use find
[20:35:18] <s5fs> Consolas: find is cool, but selecting by id should also work (and is faster)
[20:35:22] <Whirl3d> do you have a link or fiddle or something to look at
[20:35:38] <Consolas> I was going with the selecting by id way
[20:36:19] <Whirl3d> type out your load line
[20:36:35] <tbranyen> Consolas: i am here
[20:36:37] <tbranyen> to help you
[20:36:48] <tbranyen> load your content
[20:36:57] <Consolas> Just tried with the function as an argument in the load and it worked
[20:37:03] <Consolas> it populate the textfield
[20:37:21] <Consolas> I tried before using the argument in the load but with json
[20:37:30] <Consolas> ok this worked, so I guess this is the way
[20:37:35] <Consolas> tbranyen thanks hehe
[20:37:46] <Consolas> so when loading
[20:37:56] <Consolas> I need to do this changes on the loading itself
[20:37:57] <s5fs> Consolas: yup, whatever works is usually good enough for now
[20:38:01] <Consolas> I cant load it and then change it
[20:38:18] <Consolas> like I would do on an already div on the document
[20:38:31] <Whirl3d> you can, but you need to add it to the dom before you can manipulate it
[20:38:38] <Consolas> shouldnt load make the loaded file part of the dom
[20:38:40] <Consolas> ?
[20:38:45] <Whirl3d> ** not entirely true, but close
[20:38:48] <tbranyen> Consolas: can you paste your code to a site so i can see it?
[20:38:51] <tbranyen> ?pastie
[20:38:52] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:38:52] <Consolas> yes but doesn't load take care of that?
[20:38:56] <Consolas> ok!
[20:38:59] <tbranyen> i just wanna see what you have so far
[20:39:00] <Whirl3d> no
[20:39:06] <s5fs> tbranyen: his jsfiddle is http://jsfiddle.net/DnPN7/2/
[20:39:13] <s5fs> er, was
[20:39:21] <Consolas> this is the "first version"
[20:39:22] <Consolas> http://jsfiddle.net/9bfq2/
[20:39:26] <Whirl3d> load returns the data as the variable in the success callback
[20:40:00] <s5fs> okay gang, i'm gunna go debug on my own for a while. take care and good luck
[20:40:38] <Consolas> ok thanks guys
[20:40:42] <Consolas> really, really appreciated
[20:40:46] <Consolas> I think this is the way
[20:40:53] <Consolas> one more thing, do I need to use find here?
[20:41:01] <Consolas> I know the ids Im loading
[20:43:34] <Consolas> Whirl3d can I just do something like $(this "other id").stuff ?
[20:47:18] <Consolas> thanks a lot guys!
[20:47:22] <Consolas> you rooockkk!:)
[20:55:01] <dancole> How can I style the selection box that appears when I hold down the mouse and then move the mouse? (With regard to selectable.)
[21:01:42] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm trying to refresh a <select>'s options using AJAX. I can do that just fine, but if I set one of the new ones to selected="selected", it doesn't show as selected. Almost like I have to 'refresh' the <select> or something. Any ideas?
[21:02:07] <timwis> If I delete the <select> and create a new one, it recognises the selected="selected", but I'd like to just modify the existing one's options
[21:06:29] <airportyh> timwis: how are you setting the new one to selected?
[21:08:40] <timwis> airportyh: I provide the desired ID as a parameter, then on my $.each() loop, I check if the value is equal to the ID and add attr('selected', 'selected'), like this: http://codepad.org/iMJyNHKw
[21:10:44] <airportyh> hmm, have you tried building up the options as markup
[21:10:57] <airportyh> and setting it all at once?
[21:11:10] <airportyh> a simple test worked for me
[21:11:51] <timwis> airportyh: What do you mean 'setting it all at once'?
[21:11:58] <timwis> As in building a string and then doing a single append() ?
[21:12:20] <airportyh> $select.html('<option>one</option><option selected>two</option>')
[21:12:24] <airportyh> something like that
[21:12:44] <airportyh> you would build the markup string using a loop of course
[21:12:50] <airportyh> or the map function
[21:15:21] <airportyh> this is the preferred way too, it should perform much faster because it's just setting innerHTML which is native
[21:17:16] <airportyh> having said that, I'd be curious if your code would work if you moved line 7-9 to just below the $.each loop
[21:17:49] <airportyh> well, you might have to do just a bit more
[21:22:47] <timwis> Trying it out. Having a weird non-sensical issue that I have to debug here. Hate when that happens.
[21:23:06] <timwis> Not letting me append to a string within the each loop..very strnage
[21:29:28] <timwis> Ah, got it.
[21:29:51] <timwis> Hm, it seems I can't do a join() on an array of jQuery objects...
[21:30:52] <timwis> I guess I'll just add each <option> as a string instead of a jquery object
[21:32:40] <timwis> Well that seems to work. Thanks airportyh.
[21:42:41] <svcghost> Is there a way to change the width of an element on page load, so it changes it before the element actually is displayed on the page
[21:43:52] <Whirl3d> svcghost, set it to display:"block", opacity:0, width:some number, then change the opacity
[21:44:33] <johnywp> hey all
[21:44:41] <svcghost> thanks whirl
[21:44:45] <Whirl3d> hellloh
[21:44:53] <Whirl3d> np
[21:44:55] <johnywp> is there any way to make a link navigate to a #element without actually having it show in the url?
[21:45:25] <Whirl3d> ?.scrollTo @johnywp
[21:45:26] <bot-t> johnywp, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - Plugins - jQuery - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[21:45:29] <johnywp> tyvm
[21:45:47] <Whirl3d> np
[21:46:42] <johnywp> and can I link to it through <a href="#element">, make it scroll there, and NOT have it show in the url?
[21:47:03] <johnywp> basically scroll but with the href and without having it in the url
[21:47:11] <Whirl3d> you will need to write a handler for the anchor element that uses e.preventDefault();
[21:47:19] <johnywp> i did
[21:47:25] <johnywp> but it still goes into the url for some reason
[21:47:32] <johnywp> it shouldn't?
[21:48:17] <Whirl3d> $("a").click(function (e) {e.preventDefault(); var href=$(this).attr('href'); var targ=$(href); $("body").scrollTo(targ);});
[21:48:44] <johnywp> aha
[21:48:46] <johnywp> interesting
[21:52:09] <johnywp> hmm
[21:52:23] <johnywp> ty again... just trying to figure out how to incorporate this into my function
[21:53:08] <Whirl3d> what is your function?
[21:53:37] <johnywp> it worked! ty :)
