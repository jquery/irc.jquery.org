[00:00:19] <ShawnRisk> jacobfogg: not sure at all
[00:00:44] <faraway> mytoz: yeah ... i assumed that ... did you check your server logs how many access for your jsonp are done by safari ? .. probably you have some nasty recursive calls and it is requesting and requesing so you get to memory limit
[00:00:56] <jacobfogg> ShawnRisk: thanks =)
[00:01:03] <usbar> ShawnRisk: On my form I have the checkboxes like this: <input type="checkbox" onclick="this.form.submit()"> and the binding I do it like this: $("#form_id").on("submit", "[name^=filters_]", function(e){e.preventDefault [...rest of code...]});
[00:01:19] <mytoz> faraway: yeah, it does the same amount of requests (with the same data load) on both servers.
[00:01:56] <mytoz> hmmm. perhaps it does actually send more data.
[00:01:59] <usbar> ShawnRisk: All my checkboxes input fields name also starts with fields_*. The thing is that if I bind it to the click or change event it works. Right now I only display an alert box to see if its working
[00:02:28] <usbar> ShawnRisk: But I want to bind it to submit, and if I try to bind it to submit event it doesnt get executed :s
[00:02:58] <Cork> jacobfogg: just so you know, ff16 has been hold back, so ff16 is pre-release
[00:04:25] <ShawnRisk> usbar: you are using .on I thought you meant .bind.  Have you tried this: .bind('submit', handler)  Also this might help: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1892-You-Cannot-Bind-The-Submit-Event-To-Objects-Using-jQuery.htm
[00:04:26] <faraway> mytoz: in the logs you should see which was the last request that was done by mobile safari, so you at least should be able to detect which response could have ben responsible for the crash
[00:05:01] <usbar> ShawnRisk: I thought .bind was deprecated
[00:05:29] <ShawnRisk> usbar: you are right I read that wrong
[00:05:37] <mytoz> faraway: yeah, good idea
[00:05:45] <shoky> .bind isn't deprecated
[00:05:57] <shoky> but it is just a shortcut for .on
[00:06:19] <shoky> tho it's longer..
[00:07:55] <ShawnRisk> Code: http://pastebin.com/eTnk7C0N  I am trying to make buttons for a slideshow clickable so when you click button 3 that goes to slide 3.  Right now all that happens is the front page reloads instead of going to the correct slide.  Any thoughts on how to fix this?
[00:09:44] <ShawnRisk> usbar: did you try $("form").on("submit", function(event) {  ?
[00:10:19] <ShawnRisk> hi seutje
[00:10:24] <hetii> Hello :>
[00:10:31] <seutje> hey ShawnRisk
[00:10:40] <usbar> ShawnRisk: Yeap, same thing happens. I can do it with click or change but nothing happens with submit
[00:11:23] <hetii> what means the #picasa-albums in $("#picasa-albums").picasaAlbums("114736267714313794052");
[00:11:24] <shoky> usbar onclick's are gross and bad
[00:11:24] <hetii> ?
[00:11:26] <ShawnRisk> seutje: can I pm you a question as I have posted here lots
[00:11:42] <shoky> usbar: but try changing to  $(this.form).submit()
[00:11:55] <seutje> ShawnRisk: sure, but I'm kinda busy right now
[00:12:16] <shoky> usbar: better to do the click handling with jquery in your javascript code (not in your html)
[00:12:46] <Eviltwin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qpLdfIQhZg
[00:13:15] <ShawnRisk> usbar: here is a better thought on .on submit. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11172811/jquery-on-submit-doesnt-work
[00:14:36] <usbar> shoky: Yes, that's an idea. The only thing is that I don't want to rely on javasccript for this feature to work. right now it works without javascript/jquery. I'm only using javascript to use ajax and don't reaload the whole page
[00:16:15] <shoky> usbar:  the onclick code is javascript
[00:17:26] <anli> If I fetch a html block using ajax and put that in a div, and it contains script, can I call that script directly after appending?
[00:18:19] <usbar> shoky: Yeah, I'm just trying it out. You say remove it from the html input tag, right?
[00:18:46] <faraway> mytoz: another idea - i don't know how robust localStorage is agains crashes - but probably you can use this to like console.log but just storing some the call stack or something like that in it
[00:18:54] <shoky> usbar: it's not what's gonna solve your problem probably, but it is better still
[00:19:05] <shoky> usbar: did you try $(this.form).submit()
[00:21:33] <mytoz> faraway: ah good idea :)
[00:21:34] <usbar> shoky: Yeap, doesn't work either. This is really strange. I am looking at the console in firebug and I don't see any error
[00:22:35] <shoky> make a jsfiddle of the issue and someone will solve it for sure
[00:23:25] <usbar> shoky: whats a jsfiddle?
[00:23:40] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net
[00:23:44] <shoky> ?jsfiddle
[00:23:44] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[00:26:32] <usbar> shoky: great, thnks
[00:27:33] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my problem?
[00:27:50] <shoky> ShawnRisk same goes for you
[00:28:28] <ShawnRisk> shoky: I know but is there a way you can do this without an example?
[00:28:36] <shoky> why should i?
[00:28:40] <ShawnRisk> :P
[00:28:44] <ShawnRisk> You don' have o
[00:28:45] <ShawnRisk> to*
[00:28:58] <shoky> you do the annoying work, other people help you for free
[00:29:02] <shoky> sounds like a good deal to me
[00:29:33] <shoky> and the thing is, many times you'll figure it out just by making a testcase
[00:30:14] <shoky> your code is referncing an element structure
[00:30:23] <shoky> how tf do you want someone to know whats going on without seeing that structure
[00:30:26] <ShawnRisk> yes but I am not using straight html / js that is why this is hard to create a good example.
[00:31:39] <fRAiLtY-> shoky is a ledge o/
[00:31:48] <ShawnRisk> :D
[00:34:52] <shoky> hi fRAiLtY- ;p
[00:40:44] <ShawnRisk> shoky: If I can't make this work correctly in jsfiddle is that okay?  I mean the slides are there just not rotating.
[00:42:08] <shoky> dunno, give us a link
[00:42:45] <plusvick> hey, i need some simple help with drag and drop and jquery-ui 1.9.0
[00:42:48] <plusvick> http://pastie.org/5033848
[00:42:58] <plusvick> this worked fine before 1.9.0
[00:43:50] <ShawnRisk> Here is the code, and I am not sure what is going on: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/
[00:43:52] <rgr> Need some help with types. typeof $("el").data==function, but typeof $("el").data()== object. Why object?
[00:44:28] <rgr> oh cos its returning an object containing data objects I guess.
[00:44:29] <shoky> rgr: the function returns an object ?
[00:44:41] <rgr> silly of me.
[00:45:02] <plusvick> i've read the changes, but... i have no idea what's wrong... with 1.8.4 it works fine :/
[00:45:29] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: did you see: http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[00:46:06] <ShawnRisk> shoky: you see my code?
[00:46:07] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: yes, but i don't see any problem
[00:47:09] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: as i said... it worked great with jquery-ui 1.8.x
[00:47:15] <ShawnRisk> looking
[00:47:38] <shoky> ShawnRisk: ye
[00:48:11] <shoky> ShawnRisk: there is no #div-promo
[00:49:31] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: my error is : Error: cannot call methods on draggable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option' http://localhost/js/jquery.js Line 477
[00:50:37] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: what is line 477?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3827830/jqueryui-uncaught-exception-cannot-call-methods
[00:51:14] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: this is a line from query itself... want me to paste the line?
[00:51:25] <ShawnRisk> shoky: fixing
[00:51:36] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: a line from jQuery i mean...
[00:52:20] <ShawnRisk> shoky: fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/2/  This is the problem now.
[00:52:45] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: why would that be causing the error?
[00:53:01] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: throw new Error( msg );
[00:53:28] <plusvick> this is the line... but anyway... exactly the same code worked with older versions of jquery-ui :/
[00:53:50] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: look at the page I posted?
[00:54:07] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: looking now...
[00:54:33] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: also http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6069
[00:54:37] <ShawnRisk> shoky: see the problem?
[00:55:39] <CrawfordComeaux> I'm trying to build a tool similar to http://www.txt2re.com, except with a more interactive interface. I was thinking a multi-handle slider could be used to ID boundaries, but I'm not sure how the slider values could be correlated to the text. Any one got ideas on how to use a slider like that or some other way to go about it?
[00:56:40] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: I saw this bug... anyway I have no idea what is version 1.8.5, 1.8.6... the latest in 1.8 branch is 1.8.4, released just a month ago :/
[00:56:52] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: crazy
[00:56:55] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: and all those posts are 2 years old :/
[00:57:04] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: yep
[00:59:31] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: do we have some version numbers change here... ? because even on StackOverflow they are talking for jQuery 1.4.2 and jQuery-UI 1.8.5
[00:59:40] <plusvick> and those posts are from 2010 :/
[01:00:02] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: I didn't test this out.  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jqueryui-1-8-5
[01:00:50] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: look at this: http://jsapi.info/jqueryui/1.8.18/jQuery.fn.draggable
[01:01:07] <ShawnRisk> shoky: thoughts?
[01:03:56] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: the topic in the forums looks like my problem... but anyway I can not understand the solution... can you please explain it a little bit? :/
[01:05:17] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: not sure, it is weird
[01:07:12] <ShawnRisk> shoky: still there?
[01:07:21] <Gx4> hi
[01:07:36] <shoky> ShawnRisk: use 'this' not event.target, you forgot .length somewhere in rotate function to check if jq obj found smth, you're not adding/removing classes to the <li>'s when clicking on the buttons
[01:08:28] <shoky> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FEXAQ/4/
[01:08:48] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: this is the ticket which makes the change (and the problem): http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5972
[01:08:59] <faraway> plusvick: what is your used jquery version ? (not the jquery ui)
[01:09:18] <shoky> it's not perfect but it fixes some probs
[01:09:33] <plusvick> faraway: 1.8.2 is jQuery
[01:09:40] <ShawnRisk> shoky: let me look
[01:10:25] <plusvick> faraway: 1.9.0 is jquery-ui... with 1.8.24 it worked fine... I can see the changes and the un-commented code... but what initialisation?! everything worked and all my elements are in the html
[01:10:50] <Gx4> how do I insert element to div one, but inbetween <a> and <div> in here <div id="one"> <a href="#"><i class="icon"></i></a><div class="tramp"></div></div>
[01:11:52] <AdamPDotty> .insertAfter()
[01:14:36] <Gx4> ok thx
[01:15:07] <shoky> Gx4: do you mean add an element before the <a>, or add an element that will wrap the <a>
[01:15:30] <Gx4> add an element after </a>
[01:16:51] <shoky> then AdamPDotty had it right.. .after or .insertAfter will do
[01:18:44] <ShawnRisk> shoky: this works now for me, thanks.  Are there other changes you would make?
[01:19:02] <faraway> plusvick: hmm, strange are you sure you did not accidently include an older lib ?
[01:19:29] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: this might be a problem with 1.9 and since this is super new not a lot of people have tested this
[01:19:32] <plusvick> faraway: completely sure...
[01:19:58] <shoky> ShawnRisk: yes i'd ditch setInterval and move to using setTimeout for better control of timing stuff. that'd let you easily delay the auto-slide if you click a button, for example
[01:20:10] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: maybe there is a new syntax for this: $('a.drag').draggable('option', 'disabled', true);
[01:20:20] <anli> I have appended a script using append (to a div), that script defines a function, when I empty the div afterwards, that script function has not ceased to exist, should it be like that?
[01:20:47] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: yes but that example I thought was 1.9 the first one I showed you
[01:21:17] <ShawnRisk> shoky: let me look into that
[01:21:47] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: what example? I am using 1.9 for jQuery-UI and 1.8.2 for jQuery...
[01:21:50] <faraway> plusvick: can you reproduce this in a small sample ?  because this works http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/t8Q9a/
[01:21:55] <shoky> well you could easily do that with setInterval as well, so nevermind that part
[01:21:55] <Cork> anli: js will exist until everything that references it has removed there references yes
[01:22:12] <Cork> anli: and you can't append a script in a div with jquery, it will always add it in the head
[01:22:14] <anli> But there is no reference to it any longer
[01:22:25] <anli> I actually did it
[01:22:29] <Cork> anli: did you add the function in the global scope?
[01:22:36] <AdamPDotty> even if, I would not do that
[01:22:41] <anli> yes, so I presume it will become a property of window
[01:22:48] <anli> It doesnt matter who will do it or not :)
[01:22:53] <Cork> anli: does window.functiName point to the function ?
[01:22:58] <anli> must check
[01:22:59] <Cork> *functionName
[01:22:59] <ShawnRisk> shoky: are you saying that either way is fine or moving would be better?
[01:23:24] <ShawnRisk> faraway: the problem is that he is using 1.9 and that is not on jsfiddle
[01:23:28] <anli> I only do this in a test project btw
[01:23:37] <faraway> ShawnRisk: i included 1.9 via resources
[01:24:26] <plusvick> faraway: and why you're commenting those 2 lines there?
[01:24:48] <shoky> ShawnRisk: i dunno if it matters much in your case.. personally i use setTImeout for stuff like that, that way i control exactly when and if the next timeout is set
[01:24:48] <ShawnRisk> faraway: right
[01:24:59] <faraway> plusvick: cause i don't know what c is ;)
[01:25:06] <ShawnRisk> shoky: okay, I will look into this.
[01:25:40] <fALSO> good morning
[01:25:44] <ShawnRisk> shoky: I have two non-jquery (css) questions if you know that and have free time.
[01:26:07] <ShawnRisk> plusvick: are you trying to reproduce an example?
[01:26:14] <TheBrayn> is there some kind of shortcut for multiple .parent() calls?
[01:26:17] <shoky> i dont mind.. maybe others do ;p
[01:26:31] <ShawnRisk> shoky: I would post them here, but can I pm you them?
[01:26:49] <shoky> ya, if it's something quick tho
[01:26:57] <plusvick> ShawnRisk: yep... in a minute
[01:27:10] <ShawnRisk> shoky: it is positioning elements that is all
[01:27:21] <anli> Well, setting window.functionname = null; will remove the function that were added by div.append(html);
[01:27:22] <boulet101010_> TheBrayn, what you mean? .parents() for example?
[01:27:26] <shoky> ShawnRisk if its not long you can ask here too, all jquery'ers use css too ;p
[01:28:05] <TheBrayn> an example would be if I have a table inside a div and I have a td and want the div
[01:28:16] <shoky> ShawnRisk: and as usual, a fiddle is worth tons more than words
[01:28:52] <TheBrayn> I would do $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent() to get the div (td -> tr -> tbody -> table -> div)
[01:29:05] <shoky> TheBrayn: see ?closest
[01:29:06] <bot-t> TheBrayn, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:29:14] <TheBrayn> ah thanks
[01:30:07] <ShawnRisk> shoky: this is part of the same fiddle.  I just want to position the dots, and text over the green button.  You see where it says View Now or Shop Now, I want that to be positioned over the green button in my example.  As for the dots, they need to be place under the green button.  Do you see this?
[01:31:03] <faraway> plusvick: ok i can reproduce the message
[01:31:36] <shoky> ShawnRisk: i can't see the images in your original fiddle, not authorized
[01:31:44] <shoky> ShawnRisk: so i donno what you're talking about
[01:31:46] <plusvick> faraway: i am also preparing an example...
[01:31:50] <faraway> plusvick: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/t8Q9a/1/
[01:32:33] <reloadz> hi! how can i chack if ALL ("X" amount) input[type=text] are filled?
[01:32:35] <mytoz> faraway: yaay!
[01:32:42] <mytoz> faraway: I managed to reproduce the crash on my local server
[01:32:54] <faraway> mytoz: and what was the problem ?
[01:33:02] <plusvick> faraway: i dont think I can understand you...
[01:33:05] <mytoz> faraway: I mapped up the api that I do the jsonp requests to on the same port as the web server
[01:33:36] <mytoz> faraway: so for some reason mobile Safari treats the resources loaded differently if they're deemed as being from the same server...
[01:33:44] <mytoz> since the port is the same...
[01:33:49] <mytoz> odd stuff
[01:33:54] <ShawnRisk> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/2/  Do you see green button?  The text is in white under the green button.  I am saying move the dots under the green button.
[01:34:09] <shoky> no i don't see a green button
[01:34:18] <shoky> and i don't see dots
[01:34:28] <reloadz> how can i chack if ALL ("X" amount) input[type=text] are filled?
[01:34:31] <shoky> because i can't see the images..
[01:34:55] <ShawnRisk> shoky: in your example, it is the four images above the number.
[01:35:20] <shoky> ShawnRisk: yes, that's the dots..
[01:36:08] <Gx4> $(this.$el.$(".class")) - should this work? el is HtmlTableCellElement
[01:36:23] <faraway> plusvick: my guess is that you try to set options or call a method with .draggable(...) before you initialized the element to be  draggable
[01:36:37] <shoky> Gx4: not likely
[01:36:57] <ShawnRisk> shoky: the second part is your cat in the mirror, and the text under that.  Change $slideshow #buttonimage #buttontext { color:white; } to color:blue; and you see the text, I want to move over that image.
[01:37:07] <Gx4> shoky so what's the right way to write it ?
[01:37:07] <ShawnRisk> shoky: do you understand what I want now?
[01:37:14] <faraway> mytoz: strange .. but good to know :D
[01:37:28] <mytoz> faraway: yeah, really strange. gonna test some more to make sure that's really the problem.
[01:37:33] <shoky> Gx4: i have no idea what you're doing, what 'this' is , what this.$el is.. what you want,, etc.
[01:38:17] <shoky> ShawnRisk: that image keeps moving.. it's a differnt one in each slide
[01:38:18] <reloadz> plz! 'form[name="catalog_form"] input[type="text"]:checked'
[01:38:30] <reloadz> plz! how can i chack if ALL ("X" amount) input[type=text] are filled?
[01:38:37] <ShawnRisk> shoky: cat in mirror is the same on all slides
[01:38:42] <faraway> mytoz: does it depend on the size of the response ?
[01:38:57] <ShawnRisk> shoky: small image
[01:39:06] <plusvick> faraway: nope... i am not doing this
[01:39:17] <Gx4> shoky I want to select a class which is in table row, $el is th, <th><div class=class></div></th>
[01:39:17] <plusvick> faraway: please, check my example here...
[01:39:23] <mytoz> faraway: no, just whether the jsonp requests are targeted at the same host as the webpage, or a different
[01:39:25] <plusvick> faraway: http://jsfiddle.net/t8Q9a/2/
[01:39:37] <shoky> ShawnRisk: its a differnt element in each slide, and at least in the fiddle it moves around..
[01:39:42] <mytoz> faraway: so right now it's working fine when I use another port (same ip) for the API that I fetch jsonp from
[01:40:14] <ShawnRisk> shoky: the image moves yes but how do I get the text below that to stay over that?
[01:40:38] <shoky> Gx4: $(this.$el).find('.class')
[01:40:59] <Gx4> thx
[01:41:51] <shoky> ShawnRisk: if it's something that you want to stay the same in all slides, then don't duplicate it in each slide, it belongs outside the slides themselves
[01:42:05] <mytoz> faraway: I suspect that browsers handles scripts differently depending on whether they're the same domain
[01:42:19] <shoky> Gx4: unless this.$el  is a jquery object already.. then: this.$el.find('.class')
[01:42:29] <ShawnRisk> shoky: oh you are right.
[01:43:00] <faraway> plusvick: well you do, but it is not obvious
[01:43:03] <ShawnRisk> shoky: right but I don't want the image at the same location each time.
[01:43:18] <reloadz> plz! how can i chack if ALL ("X" amount) input[type=text] are filled? :(
[01:44:09] <shoky> ShawnRisk: well i dont really understand what you DO want
[01:44:23] <faraway> plusvick: the problem is the following, because the draggable is cloned for dragging, you have an additional element, with the class ".drag" (the ghost)  and now in the drop callback you select all element with the class .drag again
[01:44:49] <ShawnRisk> shoky: do you see the cat in the mirror image?  Also do you see the dots images above the number?
[01:44:57] <faraway> plusvick: which includes the ghost which is not initialized as draggable
[01:45:01] <shoky> ShawnRisk: ye
[01:45:14] <faraway> plusvick: hope you understand the explanation :D
[01:45:26] <ShawnRisk> shoky: Do you see the text that says sometimes says Shop Now?
[01:45:26] <shoky> ShawnRisk: (i see 4 differnet cat mirror images to be precise)
[01:45:52] <plusvick> faraway: nope :(
[01:45:55] <shoky> ShawnRisk: heh no. i sometimes see that text and sometimes i dont
[01:46:12] <plusvick> faraway: am not a js guy at all... can you please be more specific :/
[01:46:15] <shoky> ShawnRisk: bad attempt at wit, plz ignore
[01:46:22] <plusvick> faraway: how should I edit this... ?
[01:46:28] <ShawnRisk> shoky: 4 different cat mirror images but 1 on each slide right?
[01:46:36] <shoky> ShawnRisk yes..
[01:46:36] <mytoz> faraway: yeah, it's the usage of jsonp on the same domain
[01:46:43] <ShawnRisk> shoky: did you change the css I told you too?
[01:46:47] <mytoz> faraway: seems to be the problem. cross-domain jsonp works fine.
[01:46:52] <mytoz> faraway: and json works fine.
[01:46:54] <mytoz> excellent :)
[01:46:54] <ShawnRisk> shoky: sorry Internet wit is hard to get sometimes.
[01:46:56] <shoky> yess its blue
[01:47:31] <ShawnRisk> shoky: okay next, I want the Shop Now text to appear over the cat mirror image.
[01:47:38] <faraway> plusvick: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/t8Q9a/4/
[01:48:11] <ShawnRisk> faraway: how come the text is not draggable?
[01:48:47] <ShawnRisk> faraway: or can you only drag this to the drop here area?
[01:49:18] <plusvick> faraway: yep, all are with red border.... but how to fix? :(
[01:50:02] <reloadz> nobody loves me ;'(
[01:50:06] <reloadz> plz! how can i chack if ALL ("X" amount) input[type=text] are filled? :(

[01:50:18] <reloadz> :)
[01:50:25] <reloadz> plz! how can i chack if ALL ("X" amount) input[type=text] are filled? :(

[01:50:29] <Aamir> reloadz: loop throu
[01:50:36] <faraway> plusvick: you need to exclude the ghost form you query in the droppable
[01:50:39] <Aamir> loop through the inputs?
[01:50:50] <plusvick> faraway: when droppable is triggered I want to disable all draggable elements, because the user has to click "yes/ho" on the confirm box
[01:51:19] <plusvick> faraway: that's why I am making all .drag's disabled for dragging...
[01:54:21] <Aamir> faraway:  u might get a clue here view-source:http://pmp.aamirafridi.com/_rpg/
[01:54:26] <faraway> plusvick: did you look at the latest code ?
[01:55:55] <faraway> mytoz: really strange, but good to know
[01:55:57] <plusvick> faraway: testing now ...
[01:55:57] <ShawnRisk> shoky: still there?

[01:57:46] <ShawnRisk> why is css getting the better of me?
[01:58:00] <boulet101010_> but, serious, you may learn JS reloadz ...
[02:01:07] <plusvick> faraway: you're the guru... it works with those ghosts :)
[02:01:46] <ShawnRisk> faraway: are you a guru with jQuery only?
[02:02:13] <shoky> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FEXAQ/7/
[02:02:36] <shoky> ShawnRisk: sorry http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FEXAQ/8/
[02:03:50] <shoky> ShawnRisk: btw you are using id's where you should be using classes. id's should be unique
[02:04:48] <ShawnRisk> shoky: I always get confused with that. What about moving the four small images that are at the top left to below the cat looking in the mirror?
[02:05:12] <shoky> ShawnRisk: that's tricker since you have four different slides with different images..
[02:05:19] <shoky> trickier
[02:05:34] <ShawnRisk> shoky: I know I tried that once and failed.
[02:07:49] <reloadz> boulet101010_: thx! land me some books about jquery

[02:08:35] <grifx> hello again
[02:08:57] <grifx> I've got a string "ingredient-1545151"
[02:09:27] <grifx> I want to put in the var type: ingredient, and in the var id : 1545151
[02:09:33] <shoky> ShawnRisk here's a pretty gross way of doing it heh http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FEXAQ/9/
[02:09:58] <grifx> there is an explode in jquery ?
[02:10:30] <shoky> ShawnRisk: would probably be better to clone the buttons div and add it to each slide instead of moving it from slide to slide ;p
[02:10:45] <ShawnRisk> shoky: oh you are saying after the slideshow switches not automatically?
[02:11:21] <shoky> i mean at initialization time
[02:11:27] <shoky> once, at startup
[02:11:35] <shoky> add it to all slides
[02:12:58] <ShawnRisk> shoky: two things, how would I centre the Shop Now text horizontally?  using .clone() and adding it to this to the bottom of each slide?
[02:14:06] <shoky> meh i think we've done enough
[02:14:18] <shoky> go learn and play with css
[02:14:34] <ShawnRisk> shoky: okay thank you for your help.
[02:14:43] <ShawnRisk> I will learn css
[02:14:54] <shoky> ShawnRisk: here's a clone version: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FEXAQ/10/
[02:15:44] <ShawnRisk> shoky: thank you for all the help
[02:15:53] <shoky> eh actually dont use it as is
[02:16:02] <ShawnRisk> shoky: oh?
[02:16:10] <shoky> it keeps cloning #slidedots
[02:16:14] <shoky> creating more and more #slidedots
[02:16:23] <shoky> stop using ids ;>
[02:17:03] <shoky> i guess this is a bit safer: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FEXAQ/11/
[02:17:09] <shoky> but its still a mess
[02:17:28] <ShawnRisk> okay
[02:24:47] <lalalala> if I receive a json string through an ajax request
[02:25:02] <Eviltwin> ?eval "ingredient-1545151".split(" ")
[02:25:05] <bot-t> Eviltwin: ["ingredient-1545151"]
[02:25:09] <lalalala> and I make it an object like this: var entities = $.parseJSON(data);
[02:25:15] <Eviltwin> ?eval "ingredient-1545151".split("-")
[02:25:16] <bot-t> Eviltwin: ["ingredient", "1545151"]
[02:25:18] <Eviltwin> grifx: ^
[02:25:19] <lalalala> how can I parse the object?
[02:25:51] <lalalala> if I try with entities.each()
[02:25:52] <Eviltwin> The $.parseJSON(data) parses the JSON string
[02:26:08] <lalalala> it doesn't work
[02:26:43] <grifx> Eviltwin: Thanks !
[02:26:50] <Eviltwin> lalalala: Working with objects and arrays is covered here: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/javascript-basics

[02:28:24] <faraway> ShawnRisk: well jquery is just a small part of my daily coding
[02:29:01] <ShawnRisk> faraway: okay
[02:33:19] <faraway> ShawnRisk: i use jquery for dom traversing manipulation and event handling, for the rest i have my own library. which i developed mainly with the focus on lazy loading and event driven communication between the different code parts, to maximize flexibility and modularity.
[02:34:33] <ShawnRisk> faraway: good job
[02:37:26] <faraway> ShawnRisk: :P
[02:39:23] <Koopz> need to select all inputs in a table that has an id... what do?
[02:40:10] <coppa> $("#table-id").find("input")
[02:40:15] <faraway> Koopz: only inputs or also textarea and select
[02:40:15] <ShawnRisk> faraway: can I pm you?
[02:41:04] <Koopz> would $("#table-id").find("input").live('keyup',function(){}); work?
[02:42:20] <Koopz> nvm..it does..thanks
[02:45:46] <coppa> Koopz $('table-id').on("keyup", 'input', function() {}) is cleaner though
[02:47:46] <Koopz> hmm... i'd need to update my jquery to make that one work
[02:48:16] <coppa> you should this way of binding is much faster
[02:49:59] <Koopz> but i'd need to check if everything works after i updated my jquery.. i already tried once and some things got broken..
[02:51:35] <naveenag> Hey, does anyone have idea how can we create the closed shaped in html5 canvas and then thouse closed shapes controlled point can be altered using mouse. see the example here www.mystickerface.com/gettingstarted
[02:51:40] <coppa> which version are you
[02:51:52] <coppa> (for Koopz )
[02:52:18] <ShawnRisk> faraway: your way works only in certain cases for me
[02:52:45] <faraway> ShawnRisk: have you updated you code ?
[02:52:54] <Koopz> coppa:  don't hit me... my intranet-portal runs on 1.4.4 :P
[02:52:54] <ShawnRisk> one sec
[02:53:04] <coppa> Koopz: eheh ok
[02:53:12] <Cork> naveenag: you don't really have shapes in a canvas, its cauterized, so its up to you to listen for mouse events and do the math
[02:53:23] <Cork> *rasterized
[02:53:59] <Cork> naveenag: if you want shapes that can actually be modified you should prob have a look at svg
[02:54:36] <Cork> (and vml for ie)
[02:57:49] <ShawnRisk> faraway: I have updated this: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/12/ but unsure why in my live site this only works in certain cases but in jsfiddle this works all the time from my tests.
[02:58:21] <naveenag> I have seen some examples in which they create quadratic bezier curve and there is a circle near it's control point which you can click and move so its control points get moved as well,  what i need is combination of these two http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/tutorials/html5-canvas-custom-shapes/  and http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-modify-curves-with-anchor-points-using-kineticjs/
[02:58:56] <naveenag> modifying the closed curve using anchor points
[03:01:56] <Dirkos> why does this return an object instead of the value itself?
[03:01:57] <Dirkos> $(oClick).attr('idfield')
[03:02:34] <coppa> what is oClick there ?
[03:02:44] <Dirkos> $(this)
[03:02:46] <Dirkos> clicked element
[03:02:48] <Cork> attr should never return an object
[03:02:58] <Dirkos> well it does in 1.8 somehow
[03:03:05] <Cork> Dirkos: can you produce an example?
[03:03:09] <Cork> ?p
[03:03:09] <faraway> ShawnRisk: i think setInterval will make problems, but i don't know if this is related to your problem.
[03:03:09] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:03:17] <Dirkos> hmm let me try wait a sec
[03:03:43] <coppa> I feel rubber duck here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[03:03:47] <coppa> :)
[03:05:27] <Dirkos> hmm in JS fiddle exactly the same code works LOL
[03:05:35] <Dirkos> http://jsfiddle.net/nLpFF/1/
[03:05:52] <Cork> Dirkos: check so that $ really is jquery, and the version your expecting
[03:06:06] <Dirkos> can i do a console.log on $ ?
[03:06:10] <Dirkos> or $jQuery ?
[03:06:22] <ShawnRisk> faraway: I get it in Slide 1 of my live site, the class is not at the same position as where the images show up.  At some points too if I click the dots one after another soon the whole page will refresh.
[03:06:38] <Dirkos> yeah $ = /*! jQuery v1.8.2 jquery.com | jquery.org/license */
[03:06:55] <Cork> console.log($.fn.jquery)
[03:07:09] <Cork> that will tell you whats actually the $
[03:07:13] <ShawnRisk> faraway: would using 1.7.2 in my live site and 1.8.2 in jsfiddle made any difference?
[03:08:02] <Dirkos> could this have something todo with LIVE ?
[03:08:03] <Cork> Dirkos: btw, you should prefix your data attributes with "data-"
[03:08:17] <Dirkos> i know but its very old code from an old collegue
[03:08:19] <Cork> else you risk hitting new specs as they land in browsers
[03:08:24] <Dirkos> still at the todo to rebuild it
[03:08:43] <Cork> (as jacobfogg did earlier today)
[03:09:11] <faraway> ShawnRisk: don't think that this is a problem
[03:09:14] <Cork> Dirkos: no, the event handler has nothing to do with attr
[03:09:39] <Cork> Dirkos: attr isn't what your expecting, thats the only way for that to happen
[03:09:55] <faraway> ShawnRisk: i would suggest to use SetTimeout instead of setInterval : http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/FEXAQ/16/
[03:13:34] <klj613> hello - im using $.ajax and got a error handler. how do i check the content type of the response -or/and- check the status code?
[03:14:00] <Dirkos> Cork, it doesnt change a thing, it is still returning the object instead of the value
[03:14:11] <Dirkos> even though the object contains the correct dom element
[03:14:59] <Dirkos> when i switch back to 1.4 it works again
[03:15:07] <Dirkos> i recently upgraded to 1.8-latest
[03:17:03] <ShawnRisk> faraway: changed that, thanks, but what about the other challenges I have?
[03:17:31] <faraway> ShawnRisk: where you need to find someone else .. having a meeting now
[03:17:45] <ShawnRisk> faraway: thanks
[03:18:22] <ShawnRisk> I thank everyone for helping me, I have to go now too, but I am a lot farer
[03:21:00] <Dirkos> but what could be the cause when attr returns an object?
[03:21:40] <Dirkos> maybe this is the issue: http://www.powerhour.at/devblog/jquery-1-7-2-attr-returns-object-object/
[03:24:49] <Browser> I have a slider but i don't manage when i stop to move it, reseting the position until the min value, can someone help me please?
[03:26:05] <reloadz> WHY? var last_id = $('.box:last').attr("id");//id is '2" ||||| var new_id = last_id + 1; //output is "21" o.O
[03:31:39] <NodeX> parseInt() :)
[03:32:05] <NodeX> var new_id=(parseInt(last_id)+1);

[03:37:33] <acriax> Hi, I'm trying to show/hide a div depending on whether a radiobutton or checkbox is checked. It seems to work pretty well, except, inspecting with developer tools reveals that on change doesn't fire when unchecking the radiobutton
[03:37:42] <acriax> This is my javascript: https://gist.github.com/3871528
[03:38:20] <acriax> Is on change not supposed to fire on uncheck?
[03:39:38] <TheBrayn> I want to watch a textarea and submit the text with ajax, what's the best way to watch for changes?
[03:39:50] <TheBrayn> I don't want to require leaving the textarea
[03:40:01] <acriax> on('change') :)
[03:40:28] <orolin_> acriax: try binding to the click event, and do an if(checkbox.checked)
[03:40:50] <TheBrayn> acriax: this triggers when the user leaves the textarea
[03:41:00] <TheBrayn> (and something has been changed)
[03:41:10] <acriax> orolin_: but if I click on another radiobutton in the form, the the click event does not see that
[03:41:42] <acriax> sure, I can add the onclick to the entire form, but that seems less optimized performance wise
[03:41:48] <acriax> TheBrayn: oh
[03:42:14] <ShawnRisk> In Slide 1 of my live site, the class is not at the same position as where the images show up.  At some points too if I click the dots one after another soon the whole page will refresh.  Code: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/FEXAQ/16/  Any ideas on how to fix these?
[03:42:21] <xec> TheBrayn: keyup, probably
[03:43:03] <xec> TheBrayn: you'll have to do the change check and throttling yourself
[03:43:57] <TheBrayn> hmpf
[03:45:29] <xec> acriax: i thought change event would fire on uncheck of checkbox, do you have a live demo of it failing?
[03:46:06] <acriax> it's on changing over to another radio button in my case, and unfortunately I can't disclose the project
[03:50:13] <xec> acriax: is there another handler on the radiobuttons by any chance?
[03:50:30] <xec> acriax: http://jsfiddle.net/jvsUL/ seems to work as intended
[03:51:18] <acriax> hmm, not that I am aware of, but all the radiobuttons in that group share the same id. Not my doing, and I can't change that, since it's being created by .net-generators
[03:51:35] <acriax> I don't know if that would affect anything though, as I'm not targeting the element using the id
[03:51:55] <xec> as long as you're not using the id for anything it shouldn't matter
[03:52:55] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my problem?
[03:53:50] <acriax> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/jvsUL/1/
[03:54:12] <acriax> so okay, it only changes when it's being checked
[03:55:18] <xec> ah yes, only one event per radiobutton set
[03:55:23] <acriax> i could add a secondary class to all the radiobuttons in the list and if any of them changes, i check if my handler-class is checked or not
[03:57:34] <xec> ShawnRisk: is all this code necessary to reproduce the issue?
[03:58:13] <ShawnRisk> xec: yes.
[03:58:27] <xec> ok. *goes back to work*
[03:58:46] <ShawnRisk> xec: not looking at this?  I think this might be css problem.
[03:58:55] <ShawnRisk> you don't have to look a this at all.
[04:00:19] <xec> i'm not on my usual comp, this one has really low resolution, and i hate having to scroll up and down inside four small jsfiddle frames. plus, i really do have work to do :)
[04:00:55] <ShawnRisk> xec: nuts, can't even give this 5 mins?  If not that is okay
[04:01:52] <xec> boil it down, you might find the issue yourself - if not you made it easier for people to help look at it
[04:04:24] <ShawnRisk> xec: In jsfiddle I believe everything is correct.  In my live site, the div slidedots in the lower right images is out of position, and when I try to click, they don't show up as clickable.  The other issue, is that if I click on the images one after the other, the whole page refreshes.
[04:07:04] <lalalala> I receive a json string through an ajax request
[04:07:24] <ShawnRisk> xec: The first issue happens only when big images are floating to the left, I believe.
[04:07:25] <lalalala> then I do this:var entities = $.parseJSON(data);
[04:07:41] <lalalala> how can I loop through the entities?
[04:07:54] <xec> ?ajax101 @ lalalala
[04:07:55] <bot-t> lalalala, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[04:08:07] <xec> oh sorry nevermind
[04:08:14] <xec> i thought that was getJSON
[04:08:27] <xec> ignore that. try $.each() if the data is an array
[04:09:05] <lalalala> you mean entities.each() ?
[04:09:23] <xec> no, i mean $.each(array, function(){...})
[04:09:39] <lalalala> ohhh
[04:09:40] <lalalala> thanks
[04:15:11] <ShawnRisk> xec: any thoughts or not going to look into this?
[04:34:32] <xec> ShawnRisk: sorry a bit busy.
[04:36:05] <ShawnRisk> xec: no worries
[04:39:52] <ShawnRisk> I have to go eat breakfast so I will be back on if I can't figure this out on my own.

[04:44:48] <Nancy2012> i am using fancyBox and my popup wouldn't let me allow to click on the links… it just show up under the shadow…

[04:45:25] <reloadz> why dose success part dosen't work? http://pastebin.com/viTz4RNm
[04:47:36] <Trisox> BOE
[04:49:04] <NodeX> reloadz : I am pretty sure that data sent in a $.post MUST be json
[04:49:18] <NodeX> as it's serialized by jquery
[04:49:29] <reloadz> k will chack
[04:49:59] <NodeX> double check incase I'm tripping lol
[05:01:52] <Cork> NodeX: it has to be a javascript object or a params string, it can't be json
[05:05:34] <Cork> reloadz: }, $("#new_catalog_form").dialog('close') doesn't really make sense, what are you trying to do there?
[05:06:11] <reloadz> close UI dialog
[05:06:16] <Cork> when?
[05:06:30] <Cork> your calling it after the closing of the success callback
[05:06:51] <Cork> rather your running it has a parameter to post
[05:07:00] <Cork> so it will run before you call post
[05:07:15] <Nancy2012> hello all
[05:07:16] <Cork> *running it as a
[05:07:20] <Nancy2012> my fancybox popup load but under shadow
[05:09:05] <reloadz> thx! progress :)
[05:10:14] <Cork> reloadz: have you checked what the string generated at the top looks like?
[05:10:55] <AdamPDotty> Nancy where?
[05:11:09] <reloadz> you mean alert()?
[05:11:20] <Cork> no the "" 0 ...serialize()
[05:11:24] <Cork> uh...
[05:11:32] <Cork> * "" + ...serialize()
[05:11:56] <Cork> reloadz: and finally do you get any errors in the console?
[05:12:05] <AdamPDotty> alert(serialize(Cork));
[05:12:27] <reloadz> .serialize() is fine and no errors :)
[05:12:52] <Cork> reloadz: the command yes, but i asked about the generated string
[05:13:18] <reloadz> yes! string is fine!
[05:13:30] <Cork> ok, do you see the call in the network tab?
[05:13:50] <reloadz> yes
[05:14:23] <Cork> and it returns a 200 page with the expected content?
[05:14:31] <Trisox> private strings and public ones
[05:14:33] <Trisox> ^^
[05:15:57] <mikecmpbll> why does this: http://jsfiddle.net/wzU4M/ alert the hex value in IE8 whereas the rob in every other browser i've tested with
[05:16:03] <mikecmpbll> rghb*
[05:16:07] <mikecmpbll> rgb* christ.
[05:16:32] <reloadz> Cork: sry man! i don't understand what you ask :D:D:D:D all i can tell - eveything works :D
[05:16:34] <Cork> mikecmpbll: ie doesn't give you an rgb value
[05:16:41] <Cork> it returns #xxxxxx
[05:17:12] <mikecmpbll> but why? :/
[05:17:18] <Cork> cause its ie
[05:17:25] <Cork> they like to do things differently :)
[05:17:36] <mikecmpbll> i need to use the rgb value, how can i make it cross browser compatible?
[05:17:55] <Cork> make a convertion function that you use if you don't find rgb in the string
[05:18:12] <mikecmpbll> okidoke, ta!
[05:18:13] <Cork> #AABBCC is just byte hex values
[05:18:26] <Heather_> question why am I still getting NaN when I do var var = parseInt($('selector').data('var')); ? Then I var++ and alert and get NaN
[05:18:50] <Cork> cause the content of the data('var') isn't a value
[05:18:56] <Nancy2012> AdamPDotty: Sorry for reply u late
[05:19:08] <Cork> ?eval parseInt("a10", 10)
[05:19:10] <bot-t> Cork: NaN
[05:19:13] <Nancy2012> actually.. when i click on the delete button…
[05:19:14] <Cork> ?eval parseInt("10", 10)
[05:19:14] <bot-t> Cork: 10
[05:19:16] <Heather_> I thougt parseInt converts it to value
[05:19:25] <Cork> it does if its pure numbers
[05:19:32] <Nancy2012> pop up comes up and disable the screen
[05:19:36] <angelazou> Heather_: only if the string begins with a numeric value
[05:19:48] <Nancy2012> but the pop up should be visible
[05:19:53] <Cork> Heather_: btw you should ALWAYS provide the base size
[05:19:54] <xec> if the data is a number .data() will return a number so no need for the parseInt there iirc
[05:20:09] <Nancy2012> but it wouldn't
[05:20:18] <Cork> Heather_: else you can get nasty bugs where it converts to octals
[05:20:43] <angelazou> warning is issued too
[05:20:45] <Cork> (or hex)
[05:20:55] <angelazou> that's why I like to develop in jsBin, they debug it real-time
[05:21:15] <angelazou> need help with a snippet http://jsfiddle.net/PZNHb/
[05:21:18] <angelazou> the sound is not playing
[05:21:42] <angelazou> unfortunately I don't know a service that host audio files
[05:21:48] <angelazou> so the audio is not accessible
[05:22:23] <mikecmpbll> quick question Cork. I've noticed that if I change the css to background: blue;, then IE returns "blue" for the color
[05:22:26] <mikecmpbll> how on each do i handle that :(
[05:22:30] <mikecmpbll> earth*
[05:22:45] <angelazou> mikecmpbll: use actual hex value
[05:23:00] <Cork> mikecmpbll: i think you can use the equiv of computed value
[05:23:03] <Nancy2012> my fancybox popup box loads contents but under shadow
[05:23:28] <Trisox> sounds like css problem
[05:23:29] <Nancy2012> whenever i try to click on the box.. it disappear
[05:23:30] <Trisox> zindex
[05:24:28] <Cork> mikecmpbll: try document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(elm, null)['backgroundColor']
[05:25:27] <Cork> opps sorry thats wrong
[05:25:56] <Cork> mikecmpbll: its elm.currentStyle['backgroundColor']
[05:26:58] <Cork> i never remember which is which of those two >_<'
[05:27:50] <mikecmpbll> i'll have a look, ta Cork :)
[05:27:55] <Cork> np
[05:29:53] <angelazou> ah, found the problem, put it inside document.ready solves the problem
[05:30:11] <angelazou> but another occurs, the audio doesn't get to finish and the next page loads
[05:30:39] <angelazou> it is possible to grab the length of the audio, and pause the link for that long, then go to the link?
[05:31:16] <Cork> angelazou: yes, but the browser will handle it has a script generated link change, not user initiated
[05:31:27] <angelazou> that doesn't matter
[05:31:33] <angelazou> here is the updated script http://jsfiddle.net/PZNHb/1/
[05:31:42] <Cork> so ex. popup blocking will happen and so on
[05:31:51] <angelazou> oh, ic
[05:32:09] <angelazou> but there is no other way, is there?
[05:32:15] <Cork> no
[05:32:43] <Cork> the audio tag is unloaded when the page changes, and there isn't really a way around that
[05:32:58] <Cork> you could make it part of one page
[05:33:05] <angelazou> alright then, I can't do anything about that
[05:33:06] <Cork> and just load the second part inline when your done
[05:33:38] <angelazou> that's kind of pain and will likely cause a lot of confusion, perhaps even bugs
[05:33:48] <angelazou> so how to I go about the first way?
[05:35:04] <Cork> theres a few ways
[05:35:29] <Cork> you can just store that a link has been clicked, and when the done event happens on the audio tag goto that url
[05:35:36] <Cork> thats prob the cleanest way
[05:35:57] <Cork> $(document).on('click, 'a', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); window.target_url = this.url; });
[05:37:25] <angelazou> wait a min, is there a difference between $(document).on('click, 'a', function() {}) and $(document).ready(function() { $('a').on(click, function() {}); });
[05:38:11] <AdamPDotty> I believe yes, minor differences
[05:38:12] <johnkpaul> angelazou: only in so far as the differences between delegation and direct event binding
[05:38:13] <Cork> yes
[05:38:19] <Cork> and no its not minor
[05:38:29] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[05:38:36] <sh0ne> does '$(window).unload()' works on browser close too or just on tab close? I 've confirmed that on tab close it works but I don't know how to test if it works on browser close.
[05:38:38] <AdamPDotty> the first is .live()
[05:38:41] <angelazou> oh, because now the code won't run in the latter state
[05:38:41] <AdamPDotty> right?
[05:38:55] <Cork> the first is delegated, it binds on the element in the selector, and checks for bubbling events
[05:39:02] <angelazou> that .live, .delegate difference?
[05:39:14] <Cork> live is depricated
[05:39:18] <johnkpaul> ?g elijah manor live bind delegate @ angelazou
[05:39:19] <bot-t> angelazou, Differences Between jQuery .bind() vs .live() vs .delegate() vs .on() - http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[05:39:22] <Cork> and a bad syntax to do the same thing
[05:39:59] <AdamPDotty> same as the first part
[05:40:07] <Cork> no its not
[05:40:17] <Wolf_22> I'm having some issues getting our jQuery to run properly on an Oracle server... Right now, the server has the file set to 0755 and it's owned and grouped to "oracle". However, when using Firebug, an image directory shows up as being "Forbidden" (the jQuery / JavaScript I've written uses GET to retrieve images in a directory and output them on a page--nothing too fancy). Any ideas what might...
[05:40:18] <Wolf_22> ...be causing this?
[05:40:19] <Cork> its a wasteful way to do the same thing
[05:40:33] <AdamPDotty> hehe now you said same again
[05:40:42] <AdamPDotty> anyway I read that article first
[05:41:14] <angelazou> weird, the url assignment didn't happen http://jsbin.com/omowew/1/edit
[05:41:26] <Cork> AdamPDotty: live does $('a').live searches for all the a tags on the page, builds an array; then throws away the array and uses the selector string to bind an event listener on document
[05:41:28] <angelazou> so after the audio is played, I'm still stuck at page 1
[05:41:41] <johnkpaul> Cork: I don't believe that's true
[05:41:42] <Cork> its a REALLY bad idea
[05:41:53] <Cork> johnkpaul: it is
[05:41:53] <johnkpaul> live adds a single event on the document
[05:42:05] <Cork> yes, but FIRST it does the search
[05:42:13] <Cork> $('a') is a function call
[05:42:20] <Cork> it generates a list of all the matching elements
[05:42:29] <Cork> .live uses this.selector and ignores the array
[05:42:39] <Cork> so your doing a waisted lookup
[05:42:42] <angelazou> also tried with  window.target_url = $(this).url;  but no dice either
[05:42:43] <johnkpaul> oh I see what you mean
[05:43:05] <johnkpaul> Cork: yes, I see what you mean, I'd argue that it's a very small performance change, but you're right, no need to do that query
[05:43:15] <Cork> angelazou: url jquery element
[05:43:22] <angelazou> ?
[05:43:24] <johnkpaul> if you need .live() just use .on delegating from document, as in that blog post
[05:43:30] <angelazou> you mean url()?
[05:43:31] <Cork> angelazou: and its href ( i think i said url before so sorry)
[05:43:37] <Cork> no
[05:43:40] <Cork> just use this
[05:43:44] <Cork> not $(this)
[05:43:47] <Cork> this.href
[05:44:54] <angelazou> ehh, dice not rolling 				window.target_url = this.href;
[05:45:04] <angelazou> maybe window.href too?
[05:45:13] <Cork> no that just stores the url
[05:45:25] <Cork> you need to bind an event handler on the audio tag to know when its done
[05:45:32] <angelazou> ah
[05:46:32] <angelazou> seems this can help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9346579/how-can-i-tell-when-an-html5-audio-element-has-finished-playing
[05:47:41] <AdamPDotty> Cork: so the delegate()-version of on is recommanded?
[05:47:43] <Cork> just do $('audio').on('ended', function() { window.location = window.target_url; });
[05:47:57] <Cork> AdamPDotty: no
[05:48:06] <Cork> delegate is older, but not depricated
[05:48:29] <Cork> on is a combination of all the old still supported event handling functions
[05:48:47] <Cork> bind/delegate => on, unbind,undelegate => off
[05:49:23] <AdamPDotty> according to this article, the bind-version is less performant
[05:49:32] <Cork> thats bull
[05:49:35] <angelazou> I did this
[05:49:36] <angelazou> http://jsfiddle.net/PZNHb/2/
[05:49:41] <angelazou> but I don't think it's efficient
[05:49:43] <Cork> bind is just a wrapper for on
[05:49:48] <Cork> it runs the exact same code
[05:49:54] <angelazou> i thought that too
[05:50:02] <angelazou> but then what is the name of the action?
[05:50:08] <angelazou> if i were to use .on?
[05:50:16] <angelazou> ended as well?
[05:50:28] <Cork> yes
[05:50:29] <angelazou> ah, right
[05:50:38] <AdamPDotty> and yes, thanks a lot Cork for some light on that theme
[05:50:44] <Cork> thats the name of the event the browser generates
[05:51:30] <Cork> AdamPDotty: so tecnically, yes, bind is less performant, cause your going one more level of stack
[05:51:31] <Trisox> Cork: is a steady light
[05:51:34] <Cork> but... honestly...
[05:51:38] <Trisox> he keeps shining!
[05:51:42] <Trisox> ;)
[05:52:59] <Cork> on a modern page with jit, you can't even measure that difference :)
[05:53:36] <AdamPDotty> well, I meant $('ul').on('click', 'li', clickli) compared to $('ul li').on('click', clickli)
[05:53:37] <Cork> uh.. on a moder browser -_-'
[05:53:45] <Cork> thats not bind
[05:53:58] <Cork> thats delegate vs bind
[05:54:01] <Trisox> dele
[05:54:02] <AdamPDotty> the first is delegate. the secons bind
[05:54:04] <Trisox> gatorz
[05:54:09] <Cork> and yes delegate is more performant
[05:54:21] <Cork> but its not on vs bind :)
[05:54:34] <Trisox> Cork: is more preformant!
[05:54:36] <AdamPDotty> and .click() is bind('click')
[05:54:41] <Cork> yup
[05:58:16] <seutje> lies, that's trigger('click') :P
[05:58:27] <Cork> XD
[05:59:01] <seutje> (one of the main reasons I don't like those convenience functions)
[05:59:17] <Cork> though that said 1.8 sped the .bind path up a bit, buy not adding multiple event listeners on any elements anymore
[05:59:36] <seutje> now it binds event handlers, now it triggers event handlers, now it does some ajax stuff
[06:00:03] <Cork> ya, the trigger part should prob never have been there
[06:00:11] <seutje> damnit $.fn.load, make up your mind!
[06:00:26] <Cork> >_<'
[06:00:32] <Cork> ya that one is... scary
[06:00:49] <Cork> buy==by
[06:01:07] <seutje> I got what you meant :)
[06:04:25] <Nancy2012> i am using jquery UI tabs… only problem is that i have many tabs.. and one of the tab that has a form n i want to load once it ll be submit the content…
[06:04:45] <Nancy2012> i found that i can do it with cookie
[06:04:47] <Nancy2012> if (ui.panel.id == "tabs5") { $tabs.tabs('cookie', expires: 1);}
[06:04:51] <Nancy2012> i tried like this..
[06:04:58] <Nancy2012> but it wouldn't work
[06:05:01] <Nancy2012> help me please
[06:05:28] <Nancy2012> i want to enable cookies just on the tab5 because it has a image upload form..
[06:08:25] <Trisox> well do you have the cookie plugin installed
[06:10:29] <soee> how can i count all spans with class .error inside some container (doesn't matter how deep)?
[06:10:54] <systemfault> $('.error').length ?
[06:11:17] <Cork> $(container).find('.error').length
[06:11:25] <lamaster> why jquery does not have  reduce method, still? :(
[06:11:37] <Cork> ?.filter @ lamaster
[06:11:38] <bot-t> lamaster, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[06:11:42] <Cork> :)
[06:11:59] <systemfault> How is filter.... reduce?
[06:12:11] <Cork> reduce the matched elements?
[06:12:29] <lamaster> i need reduce method
[06:12:36] <systemfault> :/ For a programmer.. reduce is another thing.
[06:12:47] <Cork> lamaster: what is it you need to do?
[06:13:02] <systemfault> ?js [1,2,3,4].reduce(function(p, n) { return p + n; }, 0);
[06:13:03] <bot-t> systemfault: 10
[06:13:09] <systemfault> That^
[06:13:14] <lamaster> Cork: i need to summ some sort of attrs
[06:13:23] <lamaster> systemfault:  exactly
[06:13:39] <systemfault> lamaster: You could take a look at underscore.js :/
[06:13:43] <Cork> jquery helps with dom actions mostly
[06:14:15] <lamaster> systemfault: heap, or lowdash, but thought i could avoid it
[06:14:47] <systemfault> lamaster: You could take the small code on MDN :/
[06:15:12] <systemfault> lamaster: The problem is that native .reduce is ES5 and later (Won't work on older browsers)
[06:15:45] <lamaster> systemfault:  i don't have to use old browsers, how  can i apply existent code on jQuery object?
[06:15:53] <Cork> lamaster: he meant https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce#Compatibility
[06:16:59] <systemfault> lamaster: Didn't try it but you could probably do: Array.prototype.reduce.call(myJqueryObject, function(n, p) {}, startVal);
[06:17:29] <angelazou> one more snippet here http://jsfiddle.net/nVX38/
[06:17:49] <lamaster> systemfault:  heap. that exactly that i asked for,  thanks
[06:17:50] <angelazou> I'm having problem around the last section of the on.click function
[06:17:56] <angelazou> where found == 6
[06:18:04] <angelazou> I have console.log enabled
[06:18:23] <angelazou> but even though found hits 6
[06:18:30] <angelazou> that block doesn't get executed
[06:18:47] <angelazou> the logic is that every time a right answer is clicked found++
[06:19:00] <angelazou> then test if found has reached 6
[06:20:28] <Cork> angelazou: put the console.log just before the if statement
[06:20:57] <Cork> that'll prob tell you more then right after the ++ statement
[06:21:26] <angelazou> ahh, why is that though
[06:21:47] <angelazou> found is valid throughout document.ready
[06:22:09] <angelazou> yet i get an empty value
[06:22:43] <Brackets> hi all
[06:23:54] <Brackets> any ideas why this doesn't work: $("#forward").click(function(){ 		$("#forward").attr("disabled","disabled");
[06:24:15] <Brackets> then there's a bunch of code. But though the code runs, the button "forward" doesn't get disabled
[06:24:18] <Cork> ?.prop @ Brackets
[06:24:18] <bot-t> Brackets, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[06:24:23] <danheberden> .prop( 'disabled', true )
[06:24:54] <angelazou> Brackets: you should also use this keyword
[06:25:30] <Brackets> thanks, I'll give that a go
[06:25:33] <danheberden> or var $forward = $('#forward').on('click', function(){ $forward.prop('disabled', true); });
[06:25:47] <danheberden> and not re-create the jQ object
[06:26:37] <Cork> angelazou: also i think your assuming a few things that shouldn't be
[06:26:46] <angelazou> which are?
[06:27:01] <Cork> angelazou: i can get found > 7 by clicking Choice4 7 times in the first block
[06:27:09] <angelazou> nope
[06:27:11] <danheberden> a) that we ACTUALLY know what we're talkinga bout
[06:27:22] <angelazou> because once it's correct, I make the question unselectable
[06:27:25] <angelazou> so that won't happen
[06:27:36] <Cork> not in the jsfiddle code :)
[06:28:05] <Cork> angelazou: but you should build it on a solution where you don't assume things and add that to a variable
[06:28:14] <angelazou> ah
[06:28:22] <angelazou> it's in the wrapper.attr sectino
[06:28:29] <angelazou> I set the user select to none
[06:28:38] <Cork> ex. you can set a correct class on the parent element or something
[06:28:53] <angelazou> ah, crap, the user select didn't work
[06:28:56] <Cork> wrapper.addClass('correct')
[06:28:56] <angelazou> sigh...
[06:29:06] <Cork> and then do the css in there
[06:29:06] <angelazou> ah, about that, I tried both ways
[06:29:13] <angelazou> seems like a bug though
[06:29:17] <angelazou> couldn't get it to work
[06:29:20] <Cork> and ms doesn't do user-select
[06:29:29] <angelazou> perhaps it had something to do with found...?
[06:29:40] <Cork> uh. wait a min...
[06:29:41] <jmverges> hi mates
[06:29:43] <Cork> uh...
[06:29:53] <jmverges> could anybody helpme with some jquery-ui?
[06:29:53] <Cork> angelazou: -moz-user-select isn't an attribute
[06:29:57] <Cork> its a css rule
[06:30:05] <angelazou> ohoh
[06:30:28] <angelazou> is that true for all of them or just part of them?
[06:30:42] <Cork> no unselectable is an attribute
[06:30:44] <Cork> and its what ie uses
[06:30:58] <Cork> ?ask @ jmverges
[06:30:58] <bot-t> jmverges, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:31:26] <Cork> angelazou: btw, you shouldn't use attr to set classes
[06:31:43] <angelazou> yes, someone mentioned .prop earlier
[06:31:53] <Cork> angelazou: that is really risky as it assumes that no one else sets a class on it
[06:31:56] <Cork> no
[06:31:59] <Cork> ?.addClass
[06:31:59] <bot-t> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[06:32:02] <CodesStuff> Yay! bot-t is back.
[06:32:11] <Cork> ALWAYS add and remove classes with addClass and removeClass
[06:32:14] <angelazou> what's the difference?
[06:32:24] <angelazou> .attr wipes the old value true
[06:32:32] <angelazou> got cha
[06:33:39] <angelazou> but you said there was some problem with found
[06:33:44] <Brackets> sorry, still struggling here. Now using $("#forward").prop("disabled", true); but that doesn't disable the button, and typing $("#forward").prop("disabled") into the console returns false, even after this point
[06:33:53] <angelazou> I still can't seem to see the problem except to think it has to do with scope

[06:40:24] <ShawnRisk> how do I make it so if I have a slideshow and the slides have class showslide on them if active.  How do I let the dots at the bottom of the slide know so I can switch one of the images to an active state?
[06:41:39] <reloadz> HI! I append() DIV that has class="ui-sortable" (UI class that allows to "sort elements"), but i cant sort them until I refresh the page - code between adding DIV and refreshed page is NONE!
[06:42:20] <Cork> reloadz: adding the class isn't enough, you need to run .sortable() on it
[06:42:30] <ShawnRisk> hi Cork
[06:42:42] <Cork> ello
[06:43:17] <reloadz> well i have my function set :D
[06:43:27] <ShawnRisk> Cork: would you have any thoughts on my question or need code?
[06:43:59] <Cork> ShawnRisk: that depends on how the slideshow is made
[06:44:03] <reloadz> i have DIVs like tabs - all tabs are sortable and one that i just ade isn't un till i refresh page

[06:47:35] <CodesStuff> jsfiddle it if you can
[06:48:44] <reloadz> Cork: how do i run .sortable on it?
[06:48:59] <reloadz> all other tabs at that time works fine
[06:49:07] <reloadz> tabs-DIVs
[06:49:41] <Brackets> ah, got everything working. Thanks all!
[06:49:51] <ShawnRisk> Cork: Code: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/FEXAQ/16/
[06:51:39] <faraway> xckpd7: for date manipulation you could use a library like http://momentjs.com/
[06:51:44] <ShawnRisk> faraway: hi
[06:51:58] <faraway> ShawnRisk: i'm not there :P
[06:52:03] <ShawnRisk> :P
[06:55:34] <Cork> ShawnRisk: ok, and you want to...?
[06:55:35] <Aamir> what will be the best way to have public methods http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/fEWpS/
[06:55:51] <Cork> ShawnRisk: martk the relevant link as "active"?
[06:56:15] <ShawnRisk> Cork: how do I make it so if I have a slideshow and the slides have class showslide on them if active.  How do I let the 4 small images at the bottom of the slide know so I can switch one of the images to an active state?
[06:56:36] <ShawnRisk> Cork: they are no longer at the bottom sorry the top left
[06:56:59] <Cork> .index ?
[06:58:04] <Cork> links.filter('.current').removeClass('current'); links.eq(jqElem.find('ul li.showslide').index()).addClass('current')
[06:59:11] <converge> I have this div <div id="abc">aaa</div> after an ajax call I wanna change the content of this div, is that possible ?
[06:59:22] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I am trying to add a class to the 4 images to the top left.  If I am on Slide 1, the first image in the top left should change image state to active.
[07:00:13] <faraway> converge: http://api.jquery.com/html/   http://api.jquery.com/text/
[07:00:43] <converge> faraway: thanks
[07:02:11] <ShawnRisk> Cork: you know the images have a class slidedots but nothing is on the a or img within that div?
[07:03:00] <faraway> converge: or any other of the dom manipulating function, depends on what you want to do
[07:03:42] <Cork> ShawnRisk: so $('.slidedots a').eq() then
[07:04:02] <Cork> ShawnRisk: btw, pleas don't use a tags if you don't intend to use them
[07:04:12] <ShawnRisk> Cork: where?
[07:04:20] <Cork> href="#"
[07:05:07] <Cork> a better option would be to use <ul> <li tabindex="0"></li></ul> instead
[07:05:36] <ShawnRisk> Cork: right, and where do I put $('.slidedots a').eq()?  Would this be better $('.slidedots a').eq(index).addClass('active')?
[07:05:44] <Cork> only time you should use a tags is if you provide a link fallback for none js browsing
[07:06:22] <Cork> ShawnRisk: use that selector with the code i posted before
[07:06:44] <Cork> you run it in the function after its switched the "card" it shows
[07:07:35] <ShawnRisk> Cork: would you be able to add this to the jsfiddle and link me to this, I am a little confused.
[07:07:56] <geekbuntu> good morning - does anyone know where i can find out (in jq docs) if the ajaxSetup is still support, deprecated or being phased out? tyvm
[07:10:49] <faraway> geekbuntu: well http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/  doesn't show it up and  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/ has also no info that it is deprecated
[07:10:56] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I am back sorry
[07:11:34] <ShawnRisk> Cork: would you be able to do that for me?
[07:12:05] <Cork> ShawnRisk: trying to figure out what your code is doing first
[07:12:26] <ShawnRisk> Cork: no worries
[07:13:00] <Cork> i'm getting 20 elements with $('.slidedots a'), and i'm not sure why
[07:13:13] <faraway> Cork: they are cloned for each slide
[07:13:19] <faraway> Cork: but don't ask me why ;)
[07:13:19] <Cork> why?
[07:13:24] <Cork> -_-'
[07:13:29] <paolooo> hello @all, is it possible for jQuery to get the id or class selector in the following code: jQuery(".circles").Circle();   <-- I created a jQuery extension =>  "$.fn.Circle = function() {...}" . I just want to get the string ".circles"
[07:13:55] <seutje> paolooo: this.selector?
[07:14:12] <paolooo> seutje: let me try. Thank you for the quick response
[07:14:23] <ShawnRisk> faraway: I thought I took out the clone part in the newest code
[07:14:32] <Cork> ShawnRisk: $('.slidedots').eq(0).clone(true) <--
[07:14:35] <Cork> thats why
[07:14:37] <geekbuntu> faraway, thanks - glad rumor was wrong
[07:14:55] <paolooo> seutje: Awesome! Thanks! It worked
[07:15:03] <Cork> ah, no
[07:15:20] <ShawnRisk> Cork: there should be no Clone if you are using version 17
[07:16:01] <seutje> paolooo: well, I'm forced to have a highlight set to "@all"
[07:16:45] <ShawnRisk> faraway: so you are here :D
[07:16:49] <faraway> ShawnRisk: well as far as i can see you only poste the latest version where i made corrections to Cork but not http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/17/

[07:21:27] <ShawnRisk> Cork: thanks, I am looking into that now
[07:26:06] <Xtrivity> Hey guys. I am just doing a simple ajax script. Every page loads via ajax. Right now I am using event.preventDefault(); -- but for SEO reasons I want it to appear in the URL bar for example if i clicked "about" link. I want it to show www.example.com/about
[07:26:46] <pachet> Xtrivity: have a look at history manipulation
[07:26:52] <Xtrivity> http://pastie.org/5035504 is what I have so far.
[07:27:24] <pachet> ?g mdn history @ Xtrivity
[07:27:26] <bot-t> Xtrivity, Manipulating the browser history - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[07:28:19] <pachet> or there's always history.js
[07:28:35] <pachet> ?g history.js history abstraction library site:github.com @ Xtrivity
[07:28:36] <bot-t> Xtrivity, HTML5 Cross Browser Polyfills  Modernizr/Modernizr Wiki  GitHub - https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills
[07:29:59] <ShawnRisk> Cork: how do I make the first slide show the active state and when I click the images?
[07:30:13] <CodesStuff> pachet: That was the most complicated usage of bot-t's commands I've seen in this channel thus far.
[07:30:26] <Xtrivity> pachet: that doens't seem to beneficial as it's HTML5 based. I need something that is a little more old school.
[07:30:27] <CodesStuff> Actually you used google's "site:" thing.
[07:30:31] <Cork> ShawnRisk: just set it to active when its clicked?
[07:31:03] <ShawnRisk> oh I might get that
[07:31:26] <Xtrivity> is there a more simplistic way - ".onclick(function() { throwinurl: '/foobar'; });
[07:31:52] <Xtrivity> cause every site that uses ajax and pagination seems to have it show in the url bar and im almost certain they aren't using history manipulation.
[07:32:06] <Cork> Xtrivity: no
[07:32:42] <docmur> I have a php script generating DIV's that go into a box id='userBar',  these Div's have id's of the id in the sql table so 1,2,3,4  When I click a button in these div's the id is also tied to it, how would I figure out the id of the button I clicked
[07:32:45] <Xtrivity> All sites that use ajax and pagination when loading "page2" url.com/page/2 is all down strictkly through history manipulation? that seems wrong
[07:32:54] <Cork> theres only three ways to do it 1. full page loads, 2. hash form (twitter), 3. history manipulation
[07:33:22] <Cork> Xtrivity: before history manipulation there was no way what so ever to do it
[07:33:34] <Cork> so yes they have to do it that way
[07:34:26] <Xtrivity> Hmmm. Damnit. Is there an example page that you guys can point me towards that has a real life example. the documentation seems a bit confusing as to how i would impliment it.
[07:35:45] <Cork> Xtrivity: its really quite simple
[07:35:48] <pachet> are you talking about the history host object or the history.js library?
[07:35:58] <Cork> you just push to history after you've loaded your ajax call
[07:36:50] <Xtrivity> but how will that show in the URL? pseudo: on click - ajax load of about.php - url shows example.com/about.php
[07:37:29] <Xtrivity> cause when I click the link i have a <a href="test"></a> is there some way I can kill the redirect but still have that show in the bar?
[07:37:34] <anli> Can jCrop be used so that the image being cropped is moving and the viewport is fixed?
[07:37:44] <anli> Instead of the opposite
[07:37:46] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I got that to work on click.  What about the first slide, how do I make that small image active as soon as this loads up?
[07:38:36] <mouses> do you guys use youtube's given iframe embed code to embed youtube video in your site?
[07:38:51] <docmur> should this select a div with in userBar and then grab the id value of it? $('#userBar > div').attr('id');
[07:39:10] <pachet> Xtrivity: sure, just add in a call to history.pushState in your event handler
[07:40:44] <docmur> that is working but it's selecting the same ID at all times
[07:40:44] <pachet> Xtrivity: eg, $('a').on('click.mynamespace', function ( e ) { e.preventDefault(); history.pushState(some_data, 'some identifier', $(this).attr('href')); });
[07:40:58] <DEADB33F> What's the best way to have a callback run once all ajax queries have been completed... initial ajax queries may trigger additional ajax requests, so we need to allow those to complete as well.
[07:41:15] <Cork> ShawnRisk: that shouldn't be to hard to apply the same logic again
[07:41:30] <pachet> Xtrivity: you'd probably want to do a little more parsing of the .attr('href') though
[07:41:33] <Cork> ShawnRisk: you've almost answered your own question
[07:42:13] <mouses> is swfobject still the standard for embedding youtube cross-browser?
[07:42:20] <pachet> DEADB33F: have a look at the jquery promise interface
[07:42:28] <pachet> ?.promise @ DEADB33F
[07:42:29] <bot-t> DEADB33F, .promise([type], [target]): [New in v1.6] Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[07:43:11] <DEADB33F> Ah ok, I was initally using .when, but that will only handle the initial requests, not subsequently generated ones.
[07:43:15] <Xtrivity> pachet: this is what I have now: http://pastie.org/5035587 it works.. but I dont understand why I need to pass it an object. or what that object really entails and page "page 2" is really referring to
[07:44:19] <pachet> Xtrivity: well, the first parameter is a state object that you can use to tether arbitrary information to that history entry
[07:45:04] <pachet> that way, if a popstate event is fired, you can suss out whatever you want about your page state as it corresponded to the history entry you just retrieved
[07:45:10] <ShawnRisk> Cork: okay I will look into that.  The problem now is if I click the dots, the whole slideshow stops.  Do you need to see the new code I added?
[07:45:32] <Cork> ShawnRisk: i don't have time to dig in that any more sorry
[07:45:40] <ShawnRisk> no worries
[07:45:52] <pachet> Xtrivity: and the second parameter, the string title for that history entry, doesn't really matter at the moment
[07:46:20] <pachet> as history isn't really traversable by key in any of the major browsers
[07:46:24] <Xtrivity> now pachet. with my code: as hit calls about.php. If i go to example.com/about.php that's obviously not going to load right as I dont have all of the template connect to the simple about.php
[07:46:53] <pachet> yeah, that's where you have to do a little bit of work
[07:47:22] <pachet> either you have to serve that content explicitly, or check the full href with javascript at page load and then pull in what you need
[07:47:34] <pachet> the first is optimal but it means you're kind of painting the same picture twice
[07:47:46] <Cork> a tip is to add a http header from the server that returns what page you ended up at
[07:48:03] <Cork> that makes it fairly easy to actually push the correct url to history after a redirect
[07:48:12] <pachet> ^
[07:48:31] <anli> The "tracker" is not visibible in any of the jcrop demos...
[07:48:33] <Cork> X-target: /new/url
[07:48:57] <Xtrivity> i don't follow Cork
[07:49:41] <Cork> Xtrivity: when the server responds to your ajax request
[07:49:46] <Cork> make it set a http_header
[07:49:58] <Cork> with the url it wants you to show
[07:50:08] <Cork> that way if you do a redirect the page will still show the correct url
[07:50:32] <Cork> (ajax doesn't provide a way to get the redirected url)
[07:50:39] <Xtrivity> but if you are going to a site say i friend gives you the url: example.com/about ... that fucks you
[07:50:46] <Xtrivity> does it not?
[07:50:52] <pachet> read my above comments
[07:50:53] <Cork> no
[07:51:38] <Xtrivity> :| i work great with example code. I suck with explanations as I'm not sure how things coordinate with each other.
[07:51:49] <Cork> Xtrivity: either your server redirects you to a common page that does the ajax call
[07:52:00] <Cork> or you generate the full page if you get a targeted url
[07:52:15] <Xtrivity> http://www.wbhomes.com.au/ <- is a perfect example of what I want. any idea what they do cork?
[07:52:19] <Cork> (i personally prefer the second option)
[07:52:26] <gebbione> hi all  i am trying to delay this attar assignment but the delay doesn't work
[07:52:30] <gebbione> $('#venueChangeDefaulAPG :first-child').delay(10000).attr('selected', 'selected');
[07:52:31] <Xtrivity> haha nevermind - they just use htaccess
[07:52:46] <gebbione> any idea how to make it work
[07:52:50] <Cork> gebbione: delay is for animations, doens't work for dom manipulation
[07:52:59] <Cork> use setTimeout
[07:53:11] <gebbione> thanks Cork
[07:54:02] <Xtrivity> Cork so if ( goes to about.php) { load full page with template } else { load minimal content } . In that case: how can I detect if it's a direct call or if it's an ajax call?
[07:54:24] <Cork> Xtrivity: you split the page up into two parts
[07:54:28] <gebbione> ajax http header?
[07:54:45] <Cork> one that handles the content needed for the ajax call, and one that does the base templet
[07:55:02] <Cork> then based on the xhr header it picks one or the other
[07:55:19] <Cork> Xtrivity: that page does full page loads for me
[07:55:28] <Cork> don't see any ajax related links there
[07:55:35] <Xtrivity> yes i realize - i made a mistake;
[07:56:08] <Xtrivity> there is no xhr if it's a direct visit to a site though. Headers is what I need to determin if it's being access directly from the browser as opposed to an ajax request? Im new to headers - haven't read anything in regards to what im doing to know
[07:56:38] <Cork> Xtrivity: exactly
[07:56:55] <Cork> so if you don't get any xhr header you need to serve the full template
[07:57:04] <Xtrivity> will: ($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']) == 'xmlhttprequest'; work essentially?
[07:57:20] <Xtrivity> that's simple enough if so.
[07:57:22] <Cork> you just need to check if HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH exists
[07:57:29] <Xtrivity> perfect.
[07:57:43] <Xtrivity> You're a boss Cork. thank you.
[07:57:55] <Cork> <_<
[07:58:08] <Xtrivity> kinda seems like a hack though.
[07:58:15] <Xtrivity> Doesn't seem like best practice.
[07:58:44] <pachet> i prefer to push full reqs and xhr reqs to different routers
[07:59:06] <pachet> and then they can both pull from the same things as needed
[07:59:08] <mytoz> could be problematic if there's a proxy or some such that is stripping that header if you determine xhr requests by the X-Requested-With header
[07:59:24] <pachet> yeah, x-req-with are ok, but can't be trusted 100%
[07:59:41] <wfq> hi guys
[07:59:52] <pachet> hi
[08:01:30] <ShawnRisk> How come this code is not add a Class to first element of a: $('.slidedots').find('a:first-child').addClass('active'); ?
[08:02:41] <wfq> I have a link that when clicked by an user, an screen comes up and opaque the entire background. The problem is that if I say $('body').css ({opacity:0.5}), the coming up windows is opaque as well. The work around is just probably wrapping up the background in a div and make this' opacity 0.5 but it seems a very ugly solution?
[08:02:46] <gebbione> tried $('.slidedots > a:first-child').addClass('active');
[08:02:48] <gebbione> ?
[08:04:34] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: nope didn't work out
[08:04:40] <pachet> wfq: it sounds like you're trying to make the background transparent, not opaque
[08:04:56] <pachet> wfq: what's wrong with just having an overlay, maybe with background:#FFF, and setting the opacity of that to half?
[08:05:09] <pachet> then all your modal elements can just be overlaid on top of that, rather than behind
[08:05:30] <pachet> ?paste @ ShawnRisk
[08:05:31] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:06:01] <gebbione> ShawnRisk, is your raw html on a webpage? accessible?
[08:06:42] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: it is a bit different to the jsfiddle that has been worked on, but can show you that
[08:07:11] <str8uplinux> is there a way to return json data from php while the php script is still running? - I am processing data from a database and want to return a result to the screen as each email is sent per row.
[08:07:13] <Koopz> need to trigger the change-event of a widget...what do?
[08:09:25] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: do you want to see this?
[08:09:46] <gebbione> if u have it somewhere i can try
[08:11:29] <faraway> str8uplinux: yes .. but i don't know by mind, better ask this in ##php
[08:12:18] <pachet> str8uplinux: you can sort of muck it by reading the xhr.responseText incrementally as the request is hanging
[08:12:51] <pachet> in php you'd just be calling ob_get_clean() to flush the ob buffer to the response
[08:12:56] <pachet> but i think its become problematic lately
[08:13:31] <pachet> vendors want you to wait for the request to complete before trying to suss responseText :[
[08:15:12] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: Here is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/19/  I didn't add in the new css I have because I don't have images for the jsfiddle.  This line $('.slidedots > a:first-child').addClass('active'); you should look at.
[08:19:17] <Koopz> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-change <- I want to trigger the change-event manually... how can i do that?
[08:20:01] <gebbione> its ok
[08:20:06] <gebbione> i should be able to look at it
[08:20:43] <Aamir> Koopz:  element.trigger('change') ?
[08:20:56] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: the other thing is that the class in the dots class="active" doesn't get removed when this flips from one slide to the next.
[08:20:59] <gebbione> can u add jquery in the page
[08:22:06] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: pardon?
[08:22:18] <gebbione> what version of jquery do u have there
[08:22:21] <gebbione> on the page
[08:22:40] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: live is 1.7.2 and in jsfiddle 1.8.2 but I am not sure that should make a difference
[08:23:36] <Koopz> Aamir: doesn't work... I didn't bind the change event on the element with $(element).combobox() or did i?
[08:23:39] <gebbione> yea shouldnt
[08:23:44] <Cryp71c> Is there a way to anonymously create something to use in a self-reference eg: $('<span>Yo, this is a dialog</span>').dialog(...)
[08:24:06] <Cryp71c> perhaps '<span>test</span>'.dialog() ?
[08:24:45] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: you have enough knowledge on the two issues?
[08:25:53] <duc1199> Cryp71c: whatchu mean by anonymously?
[08:26:04] <Cryp71c> duc1199, without having to create an element on the dom somewhere.
[08:26:32] <duc1199> Cryp71c: $('<span>Yo, this is a dialog</span>') this actually does what you want, AFAIK.
[08:26:48] <Cryp71c> duc1199, lol yeah I JUST was messing with it..I had no idea it would work that way, thanks.
[08:27:18] <gebbione> in jsfiddle the selectors are not working
[08:27:21] <gebbione> not sure why
[08:27:36] <Cryp71c> duc1199, on a supplementary note, when a confirm is triggered on a page (and that page is minimized), it flashes in the taskbar/window manager. Is there a way to trigger that "flashyness" via javascript?
[08:27:39] <gebbione> but in the code u already use the selector to get the active link
[08:27:41] <gebbione> var slidesdot = $('.slidedots a').eq(index);
[08:28:09] <gebbione> so maybe something in jsfiddle breaks it
[08:28:17] <duc1199> Cryp71c: no, that's exclusive to native dialog windows.
[08:28:40] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: yes I know that but how to I make the first small image at the top left active?  So this has has the class="active" next to it?
[08:28:55] <duc1199> Cryp71c: moreover, that's just a feature of windows, not available elsewhere
[08:29:16] <gebbione> .addClass should work, but i can't troubleshoot in jsfiddle
[08:29:23] <duc1199> Cryp71c: e.g. not available on Mac
[08:29:34] <gebbione> also :first-child is what you need
[08:29:57] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: are you saying: $('.slidedots > a:first-child').addClass('active'); should work?
[08:29:58] <ziz> hey guys, I am using jquery.anchor.js and it has the line $("a.anchorLink").anchorAnimate() but I'm using wordpress and I can only add a rel="" to the <a> tag and not a class, is there a way to have it call a rel="" instead of a class="" ?
[08:30:03] <pachet> Cryp71c: what duc1199 said. but you might look at the html5 notifications draft spec if you're interested
[08:30:04] <gebbione> var slidesdot = $('.slidedots a:first-child');
[08:30:06] <gebbione> yes
[08:31:08] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: well it isn't working for me
[08:31:22] <gebbione> in jsfiddle running $('.slidedots') doesn't return the dom object from the console so really need  to troubleshoot it outside fiddle
[08:33:06] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: what is not working?
[08:33:33] <poppiez> how do you add multiple data-* attributes to an element at the same time?
[08:33:50] <poppiez> $el.data({ test: 1, testtest: 2 }); doesn't work, of course
[08:33:53] <pachet> short answer: you dont
[08:34:04] <pachet> modifying the jquery data object doesnt add attributes
[08:34:09] <pachet> just arbitrary props on the data object
[08:34:15] <poppiez> pachet: so I should add them one at a time?
[08:34:34] <poppiez> I could just use .attr, err
[08:34:53] <ziz> Anyone? I just want to replace $("a.anchorLink").anchorAnimate() with something to call the rel attribute instead of the class
[08:34:57] <gebbione> jsfiddle  host the page somewhere else
[08:35:07] <gebbione> something in it breaks it
[08:35:16] <gebbione> i just tested against
[08:35:27] <gebbione> the html element in isolation with jquery
[08:35:27] <gebbione> and
[08:35:30] <pachet> poppiez: that should work, i was just being nitpicky with the terminology
[08:35:37] <gebbione> $('.slidedots a:first-child').addClass('active');
[08:35:38] <gebbione> works
[08:35:41] <pachet> you're sure those properties aren't being set?
[08:35:45] <poppiez> pachet: fair enough :)
[08:36:05] <faraway> ziz: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/ ?
[08:36:15] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: trying
[08:36:19] <inv3nt0r> Good morning from Canada. I'm attempting to replace an href using jquery without success. The code I'm using is: <script type="text/javascript"> $("a[href='http://www.website.com/members-area/']").prop("href", "http://www.bing.com"); </script>
[08:36:35] <faraway> inv3nt0r: attr
[08:37:55] <faraway> inv3nt0r: to change the attributes of a html tag you need to use the .attr("href", "http://www.bing.com")
[08:38:03] <inv3nt0r> farafay: tried attr as well... it still doesn't change the link. Also as a test I threw an alert('test'); into the script and it doesnt show the alert box if I have my jquery code in there as well
[08:39:02] <inv3nt0r> faraway: The alert box does display if I remove my jquery code...
[08:39:17] <pachet> inv3nt0r, faraway: .prop() and .attr() both work in that case
[08:39:35] <pachet> inv3nt0r: your error is probably somewhere else
[08:39:37] <inv3nt0r> I am going to try this in jsfiddle
[08:39:51] <pachet> beat me to it :]
[08:40:00] <faraway> pachet: ^^
[08:40:06] <billy_ran_away> Can someone explain the sortable UI? Why does both receive and update get called when going between two lists and stop gets called when removing something from a list!
[08:40:09] <billy_ran_away> I can't win!
[08:40:13] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: didn't work out, should this be $('.promo .slidedots a:first-child').addClass('active');?
[08:41:23] <pachet> faraway: ?
[08:42:59] <gebbione> no
[08:43:54] <gebbione> ShawnRisk, no the selection from class slidedots works
[08:44:01] <gebbione> not in that jsfiddle page though
[08:44:21] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: I know but I tried this on my page and this doesn't work out
[08:44:40] <inv3nt0r> Here is my fiddle... spits out a bunch of oddness... http://jsfiddle.net/tBeKd/
[08:45:27] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: no worries about that, what about the other issue?
[08:45:29] <ziz> faraway, thanks bud that worked
[08:45:35] <inv3nt0r> n/m it works now...
[08:46:31] <gebbione> didn't see the other sorry
[08:46:59] <bentonam> inv3nt0r remove the script tags from your fiddle script block they aren't needed
[08:47:27] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: the other issue is that the class in the dots class="active" doesn't get removed when this flips from one slide to the next.
[08:47:55] <bentonam> you can see it if you view the source of http://fiddle.jshell.net/tBeKd/show/
[08:48:23] <gebbione> at the moment i see it going from one to the other element
[08:48:41] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: right, and?
[08:48:50] <inv3nt0r> bentonam: yes I removed them and it works correctly now... but oddly does not work on my live website
[08:49:15] <bentonam> link?
[08:49:51] <inv3nt0r> bentonam: I'll pm it to you
[08:54:00] <docmur> Okay so I have this weird issue where two "objects" aren't responding all the time.  When I'm on my localbox the update link will always update but when I'm on my dev server the update link doesn't $post.  The other issue is the Action button doesn't always responde and sometimes when it does the submit button inside the box wont trigger the action.  can anyone see an issue? http://jsfiddle.net/Kd2LJ/32/
[08:55:54] <gebbione> is jqMobi and jquery mobile the same thing?
[08:56:41] <gebbione> ShawnRisk, told you lots of times   unless i see the raw page with no jsfiddle i can't tell
[08:59:09] <ShawnRisk> gebbione: oh so you can't help with this part that is okay I understand.  I raw page is not live.
[08:59:36] <faraway> docmur: with "update link" you mean the submit button ?
[09:00:40] <docmur> got it
[09:01:00] <docmur> the problem was with <button type="submit"> it should of been <button type="button">
[09:01:45] <Cork> uh.. you mean input right?
[09:02:31] <nilsma> how would i go about linking to a hidden div? I have 2 divs on a page no1 is displayed no2 is hidden, how would I go about getting the visitor to the page while hiding no1 and displaying no2 in a given circumstance?
[09:03:09] <docmur> no that actual buttons had type="submit" and it should of been type="button" because when you do a $.post() you sending the "information" yourself and not triggering a ajax update
[09:05:53] <faraway> Cork: button  with no type is like with type=submit
[09:06:04] <faraway> Cork: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/button
[09:06:31] <Cork> interesting
[09:07:31] <StR> Hi everyone!
[09:08:12] <StR> Could anyone tell me how to set a property to a jqueryui datepicker after it has already been rendered?
[09:08:43] <laisner> Can you switch div's when you resize browser, and how? my current code is : http://pastebin.com/qryPc77W
[09:10:09] <Cork> laisner: why don't you just do that through css?
[09:15:05] <laisner> Can I do that?? http://jsfiddle.net/attNH/ … I wan't the menu on top when you resize the window instead of in the middle
[09:16:52] <toddWork> i'm using .sortable() and it returns a "new sort positions" array. now i'm looking for a good way to sort my other array to match the new sort positions.
[09:17:11] <wroathe> I've noticed that the jQuery UI widgets occassionally attach unique IDs to DOM elements... Aren't there potential problems with that?
[09:17:23] <toddWork> i've never used map, but is this an appropriate time to use it?
[09:17:40] <ShawnRisk> hi Cork
[09:17:47] <Kambfhase> laisner: you might want to use css media queries for that
[09:17:55] <ShawnRisk> faraway: hi
[09:18:08] <ShawnRisk> hi Kambfhase
[09:18:08] <laisner> Ok, I'll look at it right away. thanks :)
[09:19:04] <Kambfhase> Hey ShawnRisk. Come in, sit down, take off ur bra if you like.
[09:20:39] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: well I am going crazy and have 2 questions left to be answered, do you want to try to tackle them?
[09:20:58] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ ShawnRisk
[09:20:59] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:21:07] <ShawnRisk> *takes off bra*
[09:22:35] <ShawnRisk> Here is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/19/  I didn't add in the new css I have because I don't have images for the jsfiddle.  This line $('.slidedots > a:first-child').addClass('active'); you should look at.  The other issue is that the class in the dots (small images) in the top left class="active" doesn't get removed when this flips from one slide to the next.
[09:24:32] <starsinmypockets> Browser compatibility question: is the fact that something works in IE8 a good indication that it will work in later versions of IE?
[09:25:39] <Cork> starsinmypockets: no
[09:25:51] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: you saw my questions?
[09:26:21] <Cork> ms starts to try to make the browser standard complient from ie7 and up, so they break things over and over again in those versions
[09:26:32] <Kambfhase> sorry, was watchin a stupid cat video, lookin now
[09:26:52] <Kambfhase> 404
[09:27:19] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: loads for me
[09:27:48] <Kambfhase> how did the space get ther?
[09:28:33] <Cork> starsinmypockets: to be honnest you have always had to test each and every version of ie to fix its differences
[09:28:50] <Cork> its been really horrible in that sense
[09:29:35] <starsinmypockets> Cork - that basically figures... no recognition of standards, no backwards compatibility... bleh
[09:29:43] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: haha
[09:29:48] <starsinmypockets> I've noticed that using jslint.com fixes most browser compatibility issues, actually
[09:30:12] <GeO> hey guys
[09:30:13] <Cork> starsinmypockets: ya, but there is small differences you need to look out for
[09:30:31] <Kambfhase> well, that "active" looks ok to me
[09:30:46] <Cork> starsinmypockets: with older browsers when you steped down a version it broke so badly you almost had to remake the entire css rule list
[09:30:46] <starsinmypockets> Cork - do you know any good resources in this department?
[09:30:54] <GeO`> I'm coding a game, based on pokemon, and I'm currently at the "evolution" thing
[09:30:59] <faraway> ShawnRisk:  http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/ vs http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[09:31:06] <Cork> starsinmypockets: not really, its mostly bugs anyway
[09:31:14] <GeO`> I have the image of the old pokemon and the new one, and I'm looking for a cool effect to animate the evolution
[09:31:30] <Cork> starsinmypockets: there isn't really a better way then trail and error
[09:31:34] <GeO`> with jquery UI I have animate() but it's not as cool as I would like
[09:31:55] <GeO`> do you know if there are somewhere libraries with awesome animations ? Like morphings...
[09:32:49] <Cork> GeO`: i doubt you will ever find a js lib that does morphing
[09:33:12] <GeO`> :/ I'm aware it's not easily doable
[09:33:13] <Cork> not that is can't be done, but it would depend on canvas and quite a big chunk of js
[09:33:28] <Cork> GeO`: its not really harder in js then any other language
[09:33:30] <Kambfhase> ShawnRisk: Things seem to work OK for me. I dont known, what your problem is
[09:33:35] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: what about the other issue?
[09:33:41] <Cork> GeO`: but you can't do it in dom
[09:33:44] <GeO`> then any other effect which would render better than playing on the opacity?
[09:33:48] <faraway> Kambfhase: you are not alone ;)
[09:33:57] <ShawnRisk> faraway: I have tried both :first-child and :first with no luck
[09:34:23] <Cork> GeO`: opacity, and different forms of flipping tilting, sizes is what js normally offers
[09:34:28] <tipdbmp> What are the args for the Array.map method callback? I've read a few references and they seem to agree about function(value, index), but in my case it's the reverse, why is that?
[09:34:29] <faraway> ShawnRisk: well because at the point you do it there are no elements in the .slidedots  .. you really should learn the basics first
[09:34:42] <ShawnRisk> faraway: oh
[09:34:43] <Kambfhase> well my firebug tells me, that the active class swaps.
[09:34:58] <GeO`> alright I'll play with that, thanks
[09:35:41] <Kambfhase> tipdbmp: be careful, jQuery.map is not the same as Array.map
[09:35:59] <ShawnRisk> faraway: actually there is 4 elements created but are you saying that it doesn't see that initally?
[09:36:18] <Kambfhase> tipdbmp: This is like a BIG `mistake`jQ made when it was created and there is no more way to change it
[09:36:26] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: yes but class out of class="active" gets left behind and I believe that is a common thing right?
[09:37:06] <Kambfhase> Only one a has the class `active` at each moment
[09:37:22] <ShawnRisk> faraway: I got this to work, I understood what you meant
[09:37:23] <faraway> ShawnRisk: you populate the div about 6 lines after you try to set the class
[09:37:35] <ShawnRisk> yes I know that now.
[09:38:56] <Kambfhase> I dont understand what you are asking then
[09:38:58] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: I have <a class="active"></a><a class></a><a class></a><a class></a>  what I want is <a class="active"></a><a></a><a></a><a></a>
[09:39:08] <Cork> GeO`: this has quite a nice playground for animations http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[09:39:10] <Kambfhase> why?
[09:39:14] <ShawnRisk> faraway: thank you for your help.
[09:39:18] <Kambfhase> thats not a Problem, or is it?
[09:39:39] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: looks cleaner and nicer t read.
[09:39:49] <Kambfhase> o-O
[09:40:05] <Kambfhase> If it really is a problem for you, you could removeAttr("class")
[09:40:10] <tipdbmp> Kambfhase, in the jQuery docs about jQuery.map the args are callback(value, index) =)
[09:40:21] <faraway> Kambfhase: have fun with ShawnRisk i'm out ;)
[09:40:36] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: thanks for the help
[09:40:36] <Kambfhase> wish me luck
[09:41:02] <tw2113> oh come on, is ShawnRisk really that bad to deal with? :o
[09:41:16] <laisner> Kambfhase: do you have a guide og page I can look at about switching div view order? in reference to the css media queries
[09:41:33] <ShawnRisk> tw2113:  I am that bad to deal with
[09:42:21] <Kambfhase> tipdbmp: well, $.fn has the wrong ordering as well as $.each. Basically a big fuck up
[09:42:50] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: thanks that helped.
[09:42:57] <Kambfhase> :)
[09:43:35] <ziz> Hey guys I have a site that is 1000px wide but has a jquery slider with 1600px wide images, looks fine on regular browsers, but on mobile it creates a good amount of padding in the right hand side of the entire page, a lot of white space, is there some jQuery that can take care of this?
[09:45:18] <ShawnRisk> I will try and not be a pain anymore.
[09:45:41] <ShawnRisk> I am out for a bit
[09:45:55] <Kambfhase> laisner: this one looks ok: http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/
[09:46:28] <Kambfhase> laisner: its not about divs, but using JS just for rearranging your page feels kinda like an overkill
[09:46:29] <tipdbmp> tnx
[09:48:06] <laisner> Kambfhase: I'm using bones responsive theme, and the jQuery is already setup for the repsonsive part. So I thought that was the way to go
[09:50:13] <laisner> Kambfhase: the jq looks like this : http://jsfiddle.net/attNH/2/
[09:51:07] <docmur> So i know IE doesn't support the placeholder but is there a good plug I can just call or link to and solve the issue?
[09:51:55] <Cork> docmur: html5izer i think does it
[09:52:05] <Cork> ?g html5izer
[09:52:07] <bot-t> Cork, HTML5izer Placeholder - jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/HTML5izerPlaceholder
[09:52:25] <tw2113> docmur, http://csswizardry.com/2011/05/jquery-placeholder-plugin-polyfill/
[09:52:53] <Cork> though its not hard to do it your self
[09:53:22] <tw2113> cork, long time no say hi. I haven't paid as much attention lately :D
[09:53:34] <Cork> ya, same here
[09:53:53] <Cork> my company moved into its own datacenter now >_>
[09:53:59] <Cork> that was... an interesting week :)
[09:54:23] <tw2113> i'm up, most of the time, before 10am nowadays, but am also at least trying to work during the day too
[09:55:03] <Cork> docmur: be careful with plugins that put the placeholder text in the input element, cause that will break horribly with password fields
[09:56:11] <sx> Question: If I wanted the background of a webpage to change to pink onmousemove, and back to white when the mouse is not moving, how to achieve this? Must I use timeouts and such ?
[09:56:39] <fALSO> Anyone uses http://datatables.net ?
[09:56:49] <Cork> tw2113: heh, working more at night then day huh? :)
[09:57:00] <tw2113> that's what i was used to
[09:57:03] <fALSO> Im having a problem, I dont know how should my server side script return when there are no records to the datatable
[09:57:09] <fALSO> im returning []
[09:57:12] <tw2113> mind would finally kick in at like 9pm and i'd work for awhile :D
[09:57:16] <Cork> sx: yes
[09:57:27] <fALSO> But datatables keeps waiting for something
[09:57:32] <sx> Cork: was afraid so
[09:57:52] <sx> this would involve some intensive set/clear timeouts
[09:57:57] <sx> too laggy
[09:58:01] <sx> for practical purposes
[09:58:28] <Cork> tw2113: the moving week my working day started at 8 pm and ended at 5 am
[09:58:53] <Cork> that... was different from my normal schedule where i started at 6 am and ended at 3 pm :D
[09:59:09] <Cork> that weekend between the shift was killing
[09:59:26] <tw2113> yeah, that's an adjustment
[10:19:19] <djsounds02> Hi guys

[10:22:30] <djsounds02> different content for each word
[10:24:09] <winux> Is there a way to bind a change event to an image?
[10:24:16] <arkascha_> I have a problem with the datepicker (jquery 1.7).
[10:24:23] <winux> i know .change is only for inputs
[10:24:23] <arkascha_> I use it in two dialogs, exactly the same way.
[10:24:41] <arkascha_> In one dialog it works, users can enter a date in the input using the datepicker.
[10:24:58] <arkascha_> In the other dialog the datepicker pops up, but whatever you select is ignored.
[10:25:09] <arkascha_> Pretty puzzling, I cannot see any difference.
[10:25:17] <arkascha_> Anyone in the mood to take a look at it?
[10:25:52] <arkascha_> https://cloud.christian-reiner.info/?app=shorty
[10:25:56] <arkascha_> login with test : test
[10:26:21] <arkascha_> At the top there is a button "New Shorty". In that dialog the datepicker works.
[10:26:53] <arkascha_> When you open the "Edit Shorty" dialog from a lists entry (richt hand icons, the pencil), you will see that the datepicker does not work.
[10:27:01] <arkascha_> Both fields initialized identically.
[10:27:14] <arkascha_> I'd be happy for _any_ idea what might be going on :-)
[10:28:40] <arkascha_> winux: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10120733/is-it-possibe-to-bind-image-change-event-in-jquery
[10:29:21] <ziz> Hey guys I have a site that is 1000px wide but has a jquery slider with 1600px wide images, looks fine on regular browsers, but on mobile it creates a good amount of padding in the right hand side of the entire page, a lot of white space, is there some jQuery that can take care of this?
[10:32:59] <bnovc> $('#...').autocomplete(...).data(...) works fine, but if I do $('.classname').autocomplete().data() then the renderItem on data is never called on anything except the first result. Is chaining it like this not supposed to work?
[10:33:33] <ajpiano> bnovc: .data() only returns the matched data on the first element in the set
[10:33:48] <bnovc> oh, well that makes sense then. Changing it to have an each() in there fixes it anyway
[10:33:55] <ajpiano> you probaly need to do $(".foo").autocomplete().each(function() { $(this).data().... });
[10:33:58] <ajpiano> yep
[10:34:12] <bnovc> how come it only does it on the first?
[10:34:24] <ajpiano> what else could it do
[10:34:29] <ajpiano> return an array of data items?
[10:34:30] <Zzaichik> why would it continue looking once it's found it?
[10:34:35] <ajpiano> it's not a matter of "looking"
[10:34:48] <ajpiano> all of jQuery's "getters" return the value from the first matched element
[10:34:58] <Zzaichik> That's what I'm saying
[10:34:59] <ajpiano> $(".foo").css("color") only gets the color from the first, etc
[10:35:20] <Zzaichik> I get what you're saying
[10:36:21] <Zzaichik> My interpretation was, once it finds the first element that matches, it stops searching. Is that wrong?
[10:36:58] <ajpiano> yes
[10:37:07] <ajpiano> because if the first element has nothing, it just returns undefined
[10:37:15] <ajpiano> it doesn't keep searching until it finds something that has it
[10:37:22] <Zzaichik> Well cool! I learned something today.
[10:37:33] <ajpiano> woo hoo
[10:37:35] <Zzaichik> haha
[10:37:39] <ajpiano> time for a drink!
[10:37:42] <Zzaichik> hell yes

[10:47:06] <BillCriswell> adavia: Get anything if you alert resp?
[10:48:10] <adavia> BillCriswell:  i guess the isse is with the button event

[10:56:22] <BojanBG> Sorry Bill, I accidently hit enter I didn't know it was in the input
[10:56:33] <BillCriswell> BojanBG: I was only kidding haha.
[10:56:51] <BillCriswell> BojanBG: Which commas?
[10:56:55] <BojanBG> I would be very gratefull if someone would atleast point me to a syntax piece of documentation
[10:57:14] <BojanBG> Checkout the lines from 29-38 it says var elem = $(this), .....
[10:57:55] <adavia> how come the button doesnt do anything
[10:58:03] <BillCriswell> adavia: It does.
[10:58:14] <BojanBG> I cannot understand what the comma stands for...
[10:58:45] <adavia> BillCriswell: how do u know?
[10:58:51] <BillCriswell> BojanBG: This is basically a short way of doing var name = "bill";  var channel = "#jquery";
[10:59:12] <BojanBG> aha, ok thank you Bill I thought it was something stupid like that :)
[10:59:17] <BojanBG> I just couldn't find anything on google
[10:59:24] <BojanBG> Cheers
[10:59:30] <BillCriswell> BojanBG: Yeah, wouldn't even be sure how to Google that myself haha.
[10:59:36] <BojanBG> I'll lay off counterstrike for a while :)
[10:59:45] <BillCriswell> Haha
[11:00:19] <BillCriswell> adavia: Go to http://jsfiddle.net/w5Azw/ and open up the console then click the button.
[11:01:07] <dorgan> If i have a function which has the local variable tEvent  and inside that function i have a$.bind() and i redefine tEvent using var  will that mess things up, or am I good since its inside another function?
[11:02:16] <BillCriswell> dorgan: You should be find since it's inside a function. You're using var, right?
[11:02:31] <dorgan> yes
[11:02:35] <dorgan> var is the key
[11:02:36] <dorgan> :)
[11:02:50] <BillCriswell> Groovy. Yeah you should be cool.
[11:03:15] <BillCriswell> pastebin has 7.3K facebook likes... wow.
[11:03:28] <jedimind> is that supposed to be a lot?
[11:03:39] <BillCriswell> I think it is for a paste bin haha
[11:03:53] <jedimind> their twitter account has like 40k followers
[11:04:11] <BillCriswell> Damn.
[11:11:21] <gordian> hi guys, i'm using html5 placeholders on a form element
[11:11:29] <gordian> i'm looking for a reliable way to make them function properly in IE8+
[11:11:37] <gordian> i've tried a few jQuery scripts and the biggest issue is that they don't clear the fields before submitting the form
[11:12:03] <gordian> (if the input box has been left unchanged)
[11:12:08] <gordian> the most recent one i tried is https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder
[11:12:20] <gordian> any recommendations on a smoother one?
[11:13:16] <TelFiRE> Hey all. I am pretty sure this is working a certain way but it doesn't seem like it should so I want to verify... $(".cur_page").prevAll("fieldset.step").last()   -- At the prevAll step it seems to be listing them in backwards order, so last() is actually getting the FIRST "fieldset.step". Correct?
[11:14:39] <ajpiano> correct, prevAll gives you things in order of previous-ness :p
[11:14:53] <TelFiRE> haha
[11:15:05] <TelFiRE> ok thank you just wanted to make sure. most things are in DOM order it seems so I was a bit thrown off
[11:30:45] <wolfehr> hey guys, if I'm traversing through an object and want to use a value obtained in there (e.g. $(item).last().find('.count').val() ) and I want to use that value to set another property without leaving the context, is that possible?
[11:31:12] <johnkpaul> wolfehr: "leaving the context"?
[11:31:36] <wolfehr> e.e.g $(item).last().find('.count').val().end().find('.something_Else').val(set this to mthe val of count)
[11:31:47] <krawchyk> I have an issue with detecting the offset of an elements, has to do with image loading since the layout changes height when images are finished.
[11:31:56] <krawchyk> any way i can fix that?
[11:31:59] <johnkpaul> wolfehr: no, there's nothing like that in jQuery, but you could write a plugin for it if you really wanted to
[11:32:01] <docmur> Is there any reason a navbar wouldn't render in IE
[11:32:21] <docmur> actually all that really happened is the color wont show up
[11:32:26] <wolfehr> bah, I guess I'll just have to dig the value out then set it in a separate call
[11:34:06] <slackz> Given a textfield and a list with 3 items, I want to click into the textfield to give it focus, and then, when I click one of the list items, insert that value into the textfield based upon its having the last focus. I am using .blur, but I cannot seem to get access to the newly clicked object until after .blur has finished executing.. is this right?
[11:40:27] <TelFiRE> Is it ok to select something and then toggle the class you selected it with but continue to perform actions on that element? EG, $(".cur_page").toggleClass("cur_page").nextAll("fieldset.step").first().toggleClass("next_page");
[11:41:43] <converge> I need to return it to my ajax call, am I doing it right ? http://cl.ly/image/222y3m2t3s3E
[11:41:56] <converge> Im kind lost here, dont know the right way to do it
[11:42:53] <docmur> how do I apply a color to my navbar in IE, it's showing up light blue /white not black which is what it should be, firefox and chrome handle this fine
[11:53:35] <duc1199> converge: never share code like that
[11:53:54] <duc1199> converge: it's an uneditable screenshot
[11:54:07] <converge> never say never
[11:54:26] <converge> joking, youre right, but it's just to show the full thing
[11:54:55] <duc1199> you could just as well do it by using gist.github.com, for example
[11:55:43] <converge> alright
[11:55:47] <duc1199> converge: what are you trying to return in an ajax call, exactly?
[11:56:30] <converge> I wish to return a piece of html code filled with the need I got from database
[11:57:05] <converge> but dont know if I can do that using ajax, maybe I should return the array with the data and create the html stuff with javascript, kind lost here
[11:59:18] <Stavros> hello
[11:59:31] <Stavros> how can i enclose a DOM object in another one?
[12:00:39] <TelFiRE> $(".cur_page").toggleClass("cur_page").nextAll("fieldset.step").first().toggleClass("next_page"); ---- Will the element that was originally "cur_page" stay selected when I remove its class?
[12:00:58] <Kambfhase> ?appendTo @ Stavros
[12:01:02] <bot-t> Stavros, .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[12:01:11] <Stavros> Kambfhase: thank you
[12:02:54] <Stavros> i have this "syntax" div here, which i want to hide and add some text, e.g. "click here to expand" that expands it, but i want the text added with js: http://jsfiddle.net/f5yR3/
[12:03:09] <converge> duc1199: ?
[12:06:42] <duc1199> converge: you can certainly just return a subset of html
[12:06:51] <Stavros> never mind, got it, thanks
[12:07:22] <Kambfhase> Stavros: http://jsfiddle.net/f5yR3/1/
[12:07:22] <duc1199> converge: but remember that your browser must initiate the request to that php
[12:07:44] <Stavros> Kambfhase: oh, your way is much more elegant, thank you
[12:07:48] <duc1199> converge: look into $.load http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:07:49] <Kambfhase> :)
[12:07:59] <converge> duc1199: sounds good, thanks
[12:08:15] <Stavros> Kambfhase: what's the .next() for?
[12:08:32] <Kambfhase> the .next() selects the <a>
[12:08:38] <Stavros> ah, next element, thanks
[12:09:06] <Kambfhase> within the event handler i do $(this).prev() to go back to the corresponding <div>
[12:13:57] <BillCriswell> Kambfhase: What's the problem? Thinking  I missed something.
[12:14:47] <Kambfhase> The problem is, that the rent is too damn high!
[12:15:37] <docmur> using this http://pastebin.com/UG53UUqS make the navbar black in IE but white in Chrome and Firefox, how do I fix that?
[12:15:41] <BillCriswell> Well besides that.
[12:18:15] <Kambfhase> docmur: http://css3please.com/
[12:19:18] <docmur> docmur: http://css3please.com/
[12:19:42] <Kambfhase> :|
[12:19:54] <docmur> sorry I clicked there for pasting it
[12:19:56] <BillCriswell> docmur: http://css3please.com/
[12:22:11] <docmur> I just put the code into jsfiddle but it's being colored correctly
[12:24:22] <Stavros> i need to create an element that will toggle another, sort of like the tree browser in the jquery docs:
[12:24:22] <Stavros> http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.7/
[12:24:39] <Stavros> clicking on the + shows the other div, toggles it to - and clicking it again hides it. does anyone have an example i can use?
[12:25:08] <Kambfhase> Stavros: http://mbraak.github.com/jqTree/
[12:25:45] <Stavros> thank you, but i quite literally only need the text to change, like in the example you gave me
[12:25:52] <Stavros> i don't want to install a full lib, it should be 4-5 lines of code
[12:28:19] <Stavros> actually i figured it out, thanks
[12:58:26] <Kambfhase> ?eval (![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]
[12:58:48] <Kambfhase> meh
[12:59:06] <pachet> bot-t heard you typing that and left
[12:59:13] <pachet> three minutes ago
[12:59:35] <Kambfhase> that must be the first bot with precognitions skills
[12:59:56] <pachet> he learns-- he dreams!
[13:00:12] <Kambfhase> I'd call that a "fail" :D
[13:00:12] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[13:04:09] <docmur> if I have $('#status').load('script.php', data, functon(text)); where is json data how do I parse it when it has multiple datasets in it
[13:05:40] <therealklanni> docmur why are you using load() to retrieve JSON data?
[13:07:24] <docmur> I want to take the json, parse it, turn it into Div's and load it into the box I have the load attached to
[13:07:43] <therealklanni> so use getJSON()
[13:08:06] <therealklanni> load() is not meant for that
[13:09:39] <docmur> so can I just replace $('#status').load with $('#status').getJSON()?
[13:09:58] <therealklanni> no. read the docs.
[13:20:09] <BillCriswell> I hate that some jobs want a 4 year degree, kind of bologna.
[13:21:40] <Kambfhase> Thats why everyone continues with the master
[13:22:38] <BillCriswell> I actually sent that before I saw the "or equivalent job experience". It was spaced out kind of funny.
[13:23:24] <pakr_> hello, why is the hover function applying on all the items here http://kookooent.com/v2/portfolio/vito-v/ take your mouse over one of the 4 images there
[13:23:33] <BillCriswell> I refuse to get $1 into debt just to make slightly better money.
[13:24:41] <BillCriswell> pakr_: I'm thinking you didn't close something properly. http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fkookooent.com%2Fv2%2Fportfolio%2Fvito-v%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[13:24:46] <Kambfhase> pakr_: jQuery('.custom-image-hover').fadeIn()
[13:25:07] <Kambfhase> you fade in all of the buttons
[13:25:50] <Zzaichik> My first thought, you're not targeting one specific element, you're targeting all. (I'm not going to sift through your code though)
[13:27:14] <BillCriswell> pakr_: Also what they said for sure. I'd definitely be very careful about all the HTML errors.
[13:31:51] <green-> i can't seem to find a reference for this … if i have a hidden input field that is intended to contain an array … i.e. type="hidden" name="foo[]" .. how can i append new values to this field via jquery?
[13:44:03] <Cork> green-: tiy add additional elements
[13:44:12] <Cork> *you add
[13:44:50] <Cork> <input type="hidden" name="foo[]" value="1"><input type="hidden" name="foo[]" value="2"><input type="hidden" name="foo[]" value="3">
[13:47:06] <green-> cork: well sure, but i'm interested in doing it via jquery, not via markup
[13:47:20] <Cork> green-: so for ajax you mean?
[13:48:05] <Cork> that would be $.post(url, { foo:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] });
[13:48:11] <tofra> How can I make the 5 in this command dynamic?  $('#myselect option:lt(5)').remove()
[13:48:13] <Kambfhase> .append('input type="hidden" name="foo[]" value="1">') ?
[13:48:32] <tofra> like $('#myselect option:lt('+dynamicValue+')')
[13:48:42] <tofra> because this doesn't work.. :S
[13:48:58] <Kambfhase> should work, if dynamicValue is a variable
[13:50:03] <Cork> tofra: i would prob use .eq(5).nextAll() instead
[13:51:34] <tofra> crap.. it works.. only the dynamic value of was -18.. which was wrong..
[13:51:37] <tofra> sorry..
[13:51:50] <Cork> or prob even better .filter(function() {  return $(this).index() > 4; })
[13:52:15] <tofra> @cork: how do I know if this is better or not performance wise?
[13:52:25] <Cork> tofra: be careful with appending data in a selector, make sure its garenteed to be numeric
[13:52:39] <Kambfhase> just use :lt() correctly and your fine
[13:52:45] <Cork> tofra: : selectors are always slower more or less
[13:53:19] <Cork> cause they have to iterate over each element in jquery
[13:53:30] <Kambfhase> and filters dont?
[13:53:42] <Cork> it does, but it has a shorter route
[13:54:40] <Cork> Kambfhase: you can test it in jspref is you want :)
[13:54:50] <Kambfhase> on my way
[13:55:01] <tofra> :)
[13:55:36] <Cork> but filter is always as fast as any of the other in selector functions
[13:55:40] <Cork> and most of the time faster
[13:56:35] <Kambfhase> well, this might be true for :lt() but $('div.class') is definately faster than $('div').filter(fn(){ return this.className == 'class'})
[13:56:51] <Cork> sure cause it isn't using functions
[13:56:54] <Kambfhase> (or atleast i hope so)
[13:57:06] <Cork> i stated explicitly the : selectors
[13:57:07] <Kambfhase> yeah
[13:57:19] <Cork> the rest uses native dom selectors
[13:57:19] <Kambfhase> yeah
[13:57:51] <Kambfhase> ok, im fine with that :)
[13:58:06] <Cork> hmm my selector could actually be any faster
[13:58:23] <Cork> .filter(function(index) { return index > 4; })
[13:58:49] <Cork> s/any/even/
[14:00:57] <kenster> I need some easy to use jquery script to expand a div upwards similar to this, but expanding up
[14:01:01] <kenster> http://www.adipalaz.com/experiments/jquery/expand.html
[14:02:41] <Cork> kenster: what do you mean by extand up?
[14:03:01] <kenster> the examples in the link the div that opens slides downwards
[14:03:20] <kenster> I want the div that opens to slide upward and open
[14:03:36] <kenster> http://hogtown.megaspace.ca/~donhamil/
[14:03:41] <kenster> here is the site in development
[14:04:04] <Cork> you can't slide upwards in html
[14:04:05] <kenster> on the index, the bar at the bottom needs to expand upward to show content, in this case, houses for sale
[14:04:13] <Cork> that would have to scroll the page position
[14:04:23] <kenster> rats
[14:04:46] <Cork> or the element would have to be absolute positioned
[14:05:03] <Cork> but if its inflow content its not doable
[14:05:47] <kenster> k my home_bottom_nav is absolute positioned
[14:06:12] <kenster> not sure what inflow content is, but the div will have php code in it to display the listings from a db query
[14:09:11] <Zzaichik> you know, inflow content, like what a rapper does.
[14:09:54] <kenster> I thot they sing :/
[14:10:24] <Zzaichik> psh - whatever rappers do, it's not singing. ;p
[14:10:32] <kenster> right well talk then :D
[14:10:39] <Cork> kenster: elements that isn't position fixed or position absolute
[14:10:56] <Zzaichik> ^ basically block elements.
[14:11:02] <Cork> or static
[14:11:06] <Zzaichik> that aren't floated or positioned absolutely
[14:11:15] <Zzaichik> or fixed
[14:11:24] <Cork> Zzaichik: uh, no brw block isn't relevant
[14:11:34] <Cork> its position: that matters
[14:11:41] <Cork> *btw
[14:11:43] <FiSHNUGGET> What's the syntax for the fadeIn/fadeOut something like… $('element').fadeOut('slow', function(){function 1 is here}, function(){function 1 is here});  But my syntax is wrong...
[14:11:55] <Zzaichik> I know - that was incorrect.
[14:11:59] <Zzaichik> wasn't*
[14:12:30] <Zzaichik> since block elements can be taken out of the flow with positioning or a float.
[14:13:43] <razzi> no eaasy questions here tonight, i'm gonna lurk in #jquery
[14:19:54] <Cork> FiSHNUGGET: not sure what you think is wrong, cause those are valid
[14:20:13] <Cork> FiSHNUGGET: so you would have to be a bit more context
[14:20:30] <FiSHNUGGET> I thought it was right too…  but it's failing...
[14:21:13] <Cork> define failing
[14:23:36] <jaequery> quick question, can you set "httponly" property, with $.cookie() ?
[14:23:57] <Cork> that would be kinda pointless
[14:24:04] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: that's a plugin
[14:24:07] <Cork> the point of httponly is that js can't touch it
[14:24:16] <FiSHNUGGET> Uncaught TypeError: Property 'function (){**FUNCTION**}' of object #<Object> is not a function
[14:24:18] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: you'd have to check the source
[14:24:28] <jaequery> i was thinking you can set it from javascript though, just not read it
[14:24:48] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: httponly cookies are set in the headers
[14:24:59] <ryanneufeld> by the server/browser http request
[14:25:33] <jaequery> okay so theres no way you can set httponly cookies from javascript, correct?
[14:25:52] <Cork> ya
[14:25:54] <ryanneufeld> not that anyone in the last two minutes has admitted to in this this IRC channel
[14:26:00] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: DYGIT?
[14:26:08] <ryanneufeld> ?DYGIT
[14:26:09] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Couldn't find "DYGIT" in jQuery Docs.
[14:26:10] <jaequery> ok thanks
[14:26:48] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: see ?dygit
[14:26:49] <bot-t> jaequery, Did you google it?
[14:31:02] <jaequery> whats google?
[14:31:25] <pachet> its like an iphone without the case
[14:33:59] <Zzaichik> lol
[14:34:35] <Zzaichik> it's it anything like ogle?
[14:36:20] <jonathansampson> Shouldn't jQuery(documentFragment) return a jQuery object with the children of the fragment as opposed to the fragment itself?
[14:37:49] <jonathansampson> For instance, building up a fragment and then appending it as a child onto another element results in those fragment children being placed directly onto the new node, rather than being grandchildren on it beneath the documentFragment. I expected similar behavior from jQuery(), but not sure if I should.
[14:38:56] <jaequery> speaking of which
[14:39:13] <jaequery> how hard would it be to replace, jQuery and $, to just jaequery?
[14:39:37] <jonathansampson> var jaequery = jQuery; // done
[14:39:44] <jonathansampson> Not sure why you'd do that.
[14:39:55] <jaequery> i want no remnants of $ or jQuery
[14:40:13] <ajpiano> var jaequery = jQuery.noConflict(true);
[14:40:25] <jonathansampson> Or (function(jaequery){ /* code here using jaequery */ })(jQuery);
[14:40:44] <jaequery> aj: i tried but that still presents conflicts, when you have several different versions loaded
[14:40:51] <jonathansampson> Ah.
[14:41:09] <jaequery> i want it completely isolated and independent of jQuery
[14:41:12] <STyler> jaequery:  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[14:41:33] <jonathansampson> What are you talking about when you say "completely isolated and independent"?
[14:41:36] <jaequery> styler: believe me that was the first thing i tried
[14:41:39] <STyler> What aj said is what you're looking for, that's the documentation on that
[14:42:05] <jonathansampson> aj's advice is official when it comes to running various versions of jQuery in parallel.
[14:42:11] <STyler> It should work, you would then be able to use jaequery('#id').click  etc
[14:42:11] <jaequery> try loading jq 1.3.2, 1.4.3 (this is where i want it to be jaequery), and 1.6
[14:42:20] <STyler> jaequery.(
[14:42:40] <jaequery> if you throw mootools in there, it actually then breaks
[14:42:52] <jonathansampson> You're probably throwing it in incorrectly.
[14:42:57] <jaequery> its because noConflict just renames to what previous $ you had loaded right before
[14:43:11] <jaequery> so order of loading causes issues
[14:43:13] <ajpiano> jaequery: you have to load and then noConflict() it immediately
[14:43:25] <ajpiano> you can't just wait until all the scripts are loaded and shoot an arrow into the dark with a blindfold on
[14:43:33] <jonathansampson> Don't load three versions of jQuery, and then try to use noConflict.
[14:43:35] <jaequery> yes but what if you calling noConflict already? due to mootools?
[14:43:42] <pachet> and your bow made of snakes
[14:43:49] <ajpiano> load your scripts in the order you want to load them
[14:43:52] <ajpiano> is the answer
[14:44:12] <jaequery> well i haev a widget , and on some sites, i have no control of controlling the order of what users load
[14:44:36] <jonathansampson> aj, any clue as to whether it's by-design that a documentFragment is persisted in the returned object when passed into jQuery()? Seems like it should be peeled away and the resulting object should contain only the children of the fragment itself.
[14:44:42] <jaequery> they've got all kinds of funkiness, mootools on top of jquery on top of another jquery on top of prototype (think wp plugins)
[14:44:50] <ajpiano> jonathansampson: because you decided you want it to work that way and it doesn't :p
[14:44:58] <ajpiano> $( documentFragment ) isn't a supported signature
[14:45:40] <ajpiano> in the same wway that $(document) doesn't just magically "peel away" the document selection and give you only the children of the document itself
[14:45:47] <jaequery> ajpiano: why is it that i cant just easily do a search/replace on jQuery/$ to another name?
[14:46:12] <jaequery> any technical reasons ? or is it about some kind of trademark/copyright issue
[14:46:20] <ajpiano> um
[14:46:27] <ajpiano> you can do whatever you want
[14:46:59] <rgenito> i am looping through a .each ... "$('input, textarea').each(function () {"
[14:47:01] <ajpiano> if you %s/jQuery/jaequery/gc it isn't guaranteed to work though, by any means
[14:47:05] <jonathansampson> Dear god, please don't just search/replace jQuery :(
[14:47:11] <ajpiano> ^^
[14:47:13] <rgenito> inside that .each(), is there a way for me to tell the name of the element selected?
[14:47:15] <ajpiano> it is not a very good idea at all
[14:47:20] <ajpiano> rgenito: this.name
[14:47:22] <rgenito> (or the id)
[14:47:25] <rgenito> ajpiano, thanks :D
[14:47:26] <ajpiano> this.id
[14:47:30] <jonathansampson> Especially if you wish to move forward and adopt newer versions in the future.
[14:47:41] <jaequery> i think it depends on use case, for me, i want it completely separated, as if it were my own framework and my own plugins
[14:48:01] <jaequery> because i keep getting complaints from users of why widget don't work on their site etc
[14:48:08] <jonathansampson> It still sounds like you're committing atrocious acts against innocent kittens to me. There has to be a better way.
[14:48:19] <jaequery> and most of the cases its when the user has jquery and mootools together where jquery already called noConflict() earlier
[14:48:32] <ajpiano> jaequery: injecting jQuery into a 3rd party site works fine, as should a widget, and you should be able to do that with noConflitc
[14:48:39] <jaequery> so when my widget is loaded w/ noConflict(), it tends to do some weird things
[14:48:44] <rgenito> ajpiano, this.name and this.id gives me undefined -_-
[14:49:03] <ajpiano> as long as you <script src="yourjquery.js"></script><script>var foo = jQuery.noConflict(true)</script>
[14:49:08] <STyler> jaequery have you tried encapsulating it?
[14:49:21] <jonathansampson> jaequery: I'd encourage you to bring this over to us at StackOverflow. Post your code, and you'll get a quick solution.
[14:49:24] <jaequery> yes, i tried everything
[14:49:41] <jaequery> this has been an aging thorn problem i had for some time
[14:49:58] <ajpiano>  (function(jaequery){ /* code here using jaequery */ })(jQuery.noConflict( true ) );
[14:50:06] <ajpiano> immediately after loading the new jqueryt
[14:50:22] <ajpiano> rgenito: do the elements have name/id
[14:50:35] <jaequery> one time it completely fixed it was when i did a search/replace on the source code to jaequery
[14:51:03] <STyler> jaequery what aj just said would encapsulate all your code and let you use jaequery as jquery or $
[14:51:13] <jonathansampson> jaequery: That doesn't "completely fix" anything. It completely destroys the integrity of your 'solution'.
[14:51:26] <STyler> it passes jaequery in as a parameter being set to jquery
[14:51:31] <jaequery> well i'll give it a go again
[14:51:38] <jonathansampson> Don't touch core; if you try to, you're doing *it* wrong.
[14:51:49] <drim> is there a plugin to set the active element of a navigation menu when the user is scrolling the page
[14:51:50] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[14:51:58] <tw2113> with a capital W jonathansampson ?
[14:52:19] <jaequery> jonathansampson: yes, thats why i've stopped doing it
[14:52:38] <jaequery> tbh, i don't really understand why, i shouldn't touch jquery core, when all i want is my own independent framework
[14:52:48] <jaequery> but you guys have brainwashed me to think it is
[14:52:50] <jonathansampson> tw2113: Capital W, silent H, and long 'ong'; whroooooong.
[14:52:50] <jaequery> :/
[14:53:22] <jonathansampson> jaequery: Screwing up jQuery doesn't give you your own framework; it gives you a mutilated jQuery instance.
[14:53:46] <tw2113> if you're making a framework out of core, it'd make sense
[14:53:54] <tw2113> if you're making a framework that uses jquery, it doesn't
[14:54:50] <jaequery> not too long ago, people were encouraged to dig into source code for sake of open source
[14:54:58] <jaequery> hwo times have changed :)
[14:55:05] <tw2113> depends on your intent
[14:55:22] <tw2113> if you're bug fixing and contributing those fixes back to the devs
[14:55:24] <tw2113> go for it
[14:55:44] <ajpiano> jaequery: digging deep into the source code typically means like, looking at it and learning from it
[14:55:45] <tw2113> if you're doing it just because you think some parts should be done differently, it'll get interesting quick if you ever want to upgrade it
[14:55:56] <ajpiano> not blindly doing a search and replace and hoping you get the same thing out on the other side
[14:56:07] <tw2113> that as well
[14:56:07] <ajpiano> with a different name
[14:58:05] <STyler> jaequery that encapsulation should be what you're looking for as it should prevent any conflicts with any other plugins.  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring  even shows to do that even with just passing in $ as jquery to avoid mootools $ conflicts
[14:59:15] <jaequery> ok
[14:59:24] <jaequery> i'l give it another spin
[14:59:49] <jaequery> its like a ritutal for me, i seem to be re-phrasing this problem every couple months
[14:59:55] <STyler> Read that authoring page, it should help you setup the plugin shell right avoid conflicts with other plugins whether jquery or not
[15:00:23] <STyler> encapsulation was designed to prevent namespace conflicts
[15:01:54] <atxq> hey guys, how can I reference the third option in a select? I am not using name, id or class.
[15:02:10] <jonathansampson> So while jQuery(documentFragment) isn't supported, apparently jQuery(documentFragment.childNodes) is.
[15:02:38] <Zzaichik> :nth-child()
[15:02:49] <Zzaichik> ^not jquery
[15:03:11] <jonathansampson> $("option:eq(2)", "select#foo");
[15:03:24] <jonathansampson> Or make it one selector.
[15:03:45] <ajpiano> jonathansampson: why is that surprising
[15:03:53] <STyler> atxq this is what I used once to auto select it
[15:03:54] <STyler> $("#hsyear option[value='"+graduationYear+"']").attr('selected','selected');
[15:04:06] <jonathansampson> aj, I wasn't aware that a nodeList was acceptable.
[15:04:19] <ajpiano> it's similar enough to an array that it works
[15:04:21] <jonathansampson> I was thinking function, element, or string, for the most part.
[15:04:22] <STyler> just replace the id with select and the option value remove the dynamic variable
[15:04:24] <jonathansampson> Yeah.
[15:05:34] <STyler> I like jonathan's method too
[15:05:50] <ajpiano> jonathansampson: however, the jQuery collection will remain static
[15:05:59] <ajpiano> even as the NodeList from which it was created will update
[15:06:02] <ajpiano> if the dom changes
[15:06:23] <jonathansampson> That's fine for my purposes; I actually would have expected it to remain static anyway.
[15:07:09] <jonathansampson> This is actually for a unit test in WinRT, so there won't be any post-instantiation changes to the nodeList.
[15:09:28] <atxq> thanks guys
[15:09:44] <atxq> STyler, thanks
[15:09:48] <STyler> Good luck!
[15:12:26] <_pr0t0type_> hey guys.  would using $.getJSON with a https scheme not work?  Also, can we use protocal relative url's in jquery functions like this ($.ajax, etc)
[15:12:55] <_pr0t0type_> eg. $.getJSON('//google.com', blah…)
[15:13:20] <STyler> if it's not on the same domain I would use the full path
[15:15:31] <wolfehr> If I've got a plugin that acts on hove of a particular element, and I have another element that is overlaying this element, how can I bubble the hover event down to the child?
[15:15:39] <_pr0t0type_> STyler: so it works then, just need to be careful?
[15:16:09] <madprops> how can i execute something afte a timeout ends?
[15:16:25] <STyler> Yeah I just looked at the documentation and like I thought it shouldn't have any conflicts with https
[15:16:42] <STyler> If you're having trouble with getjson switch to ajax and just use the jsonp tytpe
[15:16:45] <STyler> type*
[15:17:30] <STyler> Madprops setinterval might work for you
[15:18:18] <STyler> wolfehr what you do mean by overlaying?
[15:18:38] <wolfehr> absolutely positioned over another element
[15:19:12] <wolfehr> it's essentially a div with a background image and a transparency in the middle, however I need the hover event on the image that's underneath that, to be triggered when the overlaying element is hovered
[15:20:03] <STyler> Oh god I did that once wolfehr, it wasn't easy
[15:20:08] <STyler> Let me look up that code real quick
[15:20:59] <wolfehr> I'm not sure how much flexibility jQuery has with delegation (not even sure if delegates exist at all)
[15:24:02] <STyler> Okay so you basically want to put the hover event on the top most element
[15:24:30] <STyler> then when that fires launch the image
[15:25:20] <Mamoun> Hi, I'm trying to use hoverintent plugin on a navigation menu (that uses superfish)...
[15:25:48] <Mamoun> When hovering a menu item, the menu item extends, jquery adds padding to top and bottom of the a tag
[15:25:54] <Mamoun> anyway, here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/6UAwY/
[15:26:14] <Mamoun> the thing is, when all hover functions are replaced with hoverintent, it doesn't work
[15:26:48] <Mamoun> Please forgive my crappy javascript coding skills, I'm a designer not a coder :D
[15:50:00] <KWhat_Work> In jquery 1.9 did $.ux.inputbox.prototype._destroy.call(); just become this._super()._destroy() or this._super('_destroy') or what?
[15:56:21] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: _.super("destroy")
[15:56:38] <ajpiano> though the docs could use an example
[15:57:53] <ajpiano> actually i'm wrong
[15:58:08] <ajpiano> you just call this._super() inside of destroy
[15:58:10] <ajpiano> and it works
[15:58:52] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: in the case of destroy, i don't think you have to "super" it at all anymore
[15:58:57] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js#L389
[15:58:58] <KWhat_Work> awesome
[15:59:00] <KWhat_Work> thanks
[16:03:26] <TelFiRE> What's wrong with this simple code? http://jsbin.com/axesaw/1/edit I am saying, GO TO left: 100% and yet it is starting out at like left: 10% or something. It's just doing the total wrong thing.
[16:07:00] <clondike> wanna include some html in there TelFiRE ? this works fine in my imagination
[16:08:05] <TelFiRE> clondike: well, when I tried to get everything working in jsbin I spent half an hour and then gave up, it's a mess. But you can see it work here: http://uncorkhope.cpstest1.info/node/add/auction-event
[16:11:32] <clondike> i would guess it's CSS related
[16:11:44] <clondike> because this simple version works okay for me http://jsfiddle.net/EpHQc/ (i think)
[16:11:49] <TelFiRE> it was that I was using 0 instead of 0%
[16:12:12] <TelFiRE> that is the kind of thing that always throws me, so much time in CSS that to me those two are identical
[16:12:16] <TelFiRE> but not to jquery heh
[16:12:31] <clondike> ah! well diagnosed
[16:12:38] <clondike> good job
[16:12:47] <TelFiRE> thx for lookin :)
[16:12:58] <TelFiRE> ok finally time to go home. Today has been frustrating xD peace out
[16:13:10] <clondike> respect!
[16:31:54] <civilordergone> hey
[16:32:27] <civilordergone> how would i save the image / create a thumbnail w/ this crop http://www.trepmag.ch/z/jrac/example/
[16:32:30] <civilordergone> thanks :)
[16:38:20] <KWhat_Work> is still possible to create a datepicker dialog?
[16:39:32] <alien_talk> hey how would i save the image / create a thumbnail w/ this crop http://www.trepmag.ch/z/jrac/example/
[16:41:12] <KWhat_Work> alien_talk: my *guess* would be that you need to upload the image to the backend and use something like imagemagik to crop it.
[16:44:37] <alien_talk> KWhat_Work, is there any way to do it client side?
[16:44:51] <alien_talk> like resizing and repositioning
[16:44:57] <alien_talk> the img?
[16:50:17] <clondike> you could probably do it with canvas and the html5 file API
[16:50:21] <clondike> but that won't work everywhere
[16:51:55] <clondike> see for example http://www.pixelzdesign.com/blog_view.php?id=59
[17:58:03] <crankharder> is there a plugin that can print an iframe?
[18:01:13] <clondike> crankharder: did you see these kinds of posts? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/831147/printing-contents-of-a-dynamically-created-iframe-from-parent-window
[18:03:02] <crankharder> TypeError: Object [object Window] has no method 'print'
[18:03:10] <crankharder> from window.frames['fooframe'].print()
[18:03:13] <crankharder> clondike: ^
[18:05:24] <clondike> i would have thought it would be window.frames[0]
[18:05:26] <clondike> or somesuch
[18:30:03] <crankharder> well, window.frames[0] == window.frames['fooframe'] is true
[18:35:01] <Stavros> hello

[20:48:20] <ibodi> form.submit button clicked, doing something and submit form . however the value of the button is not forwarded to next page, what's the best way?

[21:22:09] <angelazou> I have a snippet here http://jsfiddle.net/nK3XP/ that doesn't work the way I'm expecting it to
[21:22:18] <angelazou> the problematic code is in the document.ready
[21:22:45] <angelazou> I have found = 0, and increment later on as right matches come along
[21:23:29] <angelazou> however, it seems like found can't jump out of the variable until it reaches 6
[21:23:35] <angelazou> which is the length of the pairs variable
[21:24:00] <angelazou> and only until the 7th time would it hit the next if block
[21:24:06] <angelazou> which is to show the win message
[21:24:54] <angelazou> in addition to that, the addClass for the wrapper doesn't seem to apply either

[22:04:52] <lethjakman_lapto> something along the lines of $('.pane .clearfix img').attr('width', '100');
[22:04:56] <lethjakman_lapto> civilordergone
[22:05:27] <alien-talk> thanks lethjakman_lapto
[22:05:56] <lethjakman_lapto> ?
[22:05:59] <lethjakman_lapto> you changed user names?
[22:06:01] <alien-talk> ah yeah
[22:06:03] <alien-talk> haha
[22:06:43] <alien-talk> lethjakman_lapto, so i would have to create a pane + clearfix class that's an image?
[22:06:56] <lethjakman_lapto> honestly I'd give the img an id
[22:07:13] <alien-talk> okie doke
[22:09:16] <lethjakman_lapto> oh
[22:09:20] <lethjakman_lapto> are you using jquery on this page?
[22:09:20] <alien-talk> lethjakman_lapto, now wha?
[22:09:21] <alien-talk> yeah
[22:09:34] <alien-talk> i'm confused how to grab the croppd image
[22:10:23] <lethjakman_lapto> do you have the actual jquery on the page besides jquery UI?
[22:10:43] <lethjakman_lapto> I've never used UI, I don't know if it has all of the jquery stuff or not?
[22:11:01] <alien-talk> i could import the latest jquery
[22:11:11] <alien-talk> err
[22:11:17] <alien-talk> *face-palms*
[22:11:29] <alien-talk> i'll try to find a more developer image crop
[22:11:58] <lethjakman_lapto> oh I see what you're trying to do, sorry I'm tired
[22:12:14] <lethjakman_lapto> I think this'll work for you
[22:12:14] <lethjakman_lapto> http://code.google.com/p/jcrop/
[22:12:31] <alien-talk> lethjakman_lapto,  thanks!
[22:12:43] <lethjakman_lapto> I misunderstood you to just want to resize it
[22:14:15] <alien-talk> lethjakman_lapto, ah by resize, i'm looking for one where you can resize the original image
[22:14:21] <alien-talk> e.g. expand it
[22:14:27] <alien-talk> then crop what parts you want
[22:14:43] <alien-talk> so, essentially like this: http://www.trepmag.ch/z/jrac/example/ but being able to save the image
[22:15:36] <alien-talk> it appears this one you can't resize the original image :(
[22:15:58] <alien-talk> actually i lied
[22:16:06] <lethjakman_lapto> http://deepliquid.com/projects/Jcrop/demos.php?demo=live_crop
[22:16:12] <alien-talk> the thumbnail one
[22:16:13] <alien-talk> ah thanks
[22:16:24] <lethjakman_lapto> it crops it, pretty cool actually
[22:18:46] <alien-talk> thanks again lethjakman_lapto  :))
[22:31:49] <lethjakman_lapto> alien-talk anytime :)
