[00:00:10] <systemfault> raj: Nope, as CSS isn't HTML
[00:00:32] <systemfault> It"s totally fine to set a span to display: block; inside a <button> for example.
[00:01:04] <rabbi1> http://pastebin.com/Yqrp81BH  what is better way to take out the function out of loop here ?
[00:01:34] <raj> gotcha
[00:01:36] <raj> thank you
[00:03:26] <systemfault> rabbi1: Don't.
[00:04:46] <rabbi1> systemfault: not required ?
[00:04:58] <systemfault> rabbi1: Why would it be?
[00:05:06] <systemfault> rabbi1: If your code works...
[00:05:17] <systemfault> JSLint is complaining or what?
[00:05:30] <glosoli> anyone can tell me if latest Stable jQuery UI supports IE8  ?
[00:05:46] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeap
[00:06:21] <rabbi1> can't see toomany error messages .... :) but okay, can leave withit if it's not important .... thank you
[00:06:42] <systemfault> rabbi1: One day, take a look at JSHintâ€¦ it's less annoying.
[00:08:03] <jaffipaffi> glosoli: 1.9 does. But when 2.0 goes stable, it won't
[00:09:03] <glosoli> jaffipaffi: so if I want to keep support for that crap IE8 I should keep jQuery 1.9.1.js and jQuery UI files not updated yes ?
[00:09:35] <jaffipaffi> glosoli: Not updated? 1.9 will be maintained in the future. 2.0 is just a more streamlined release
[00:09:38] <jaffipaffi> glosoli: http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/01/jquery-1-9-and-2-0-tldr-edition/
[00:09:42] <rabbi1> systemfault: sure, but i guess i got both in sublime-text ...
[00:12:51] <glosoli> jaffipaffi: so How then not to fail when having wrong branch selected, afaik at the moment master branch for jquery-ui uses jquery 1.9 UI 1.10 what will happen to it when jQuery 2 will be released ?
[00:14:14] <jaffipaffi> glosoli: I guess you will have the choice between the two? But don't know, as it isn't released yet (and I'm not developing jQuery). But you have to see 1.9 and 2.0 as two different jQuery. They will both be updated in the future. 2.0 is not "taking" over 1.9
[00:14:52] <glosoli> aa thanks for answer then :)
[00:15:12] <jaffipaffi> np
[00:18:48] <JBlitzen> I have a div ID stored in a var
[00:18:52] <JBlitzen> "div_1"
[00:18:59] <JBlitzen> How do I select it in jquery?
[00:19:07] <JBlitzen> $(id_var)
[00:19:09] <JBlitzen> seems not to work
[00:19:11] <Cork> $('#' + my_var)
[00:19:29] <JBlitzen> Weird, the one time I assume there has to be an easier way than what leaps to mind
[00:19:36] <JBlitzen> Heh, k ty
[00:20:26] <Cork> if the string you have in a variable isn't a valid selector, you need to add the parts thats missing; its as simple as that
[00:20:50] <jaffipaffi> Yeah. How should jQuery know whether it's an id, class, other in the var :)
[00:20:55] <jaffipaffi> You have to tell it
[00:21:09] <JBlitzen> Shrug
[00:23:12] <JBlitzen> ugh
[00:30:49] <JBlitzen> ugh
[00:31:05] <JBlitzen> This is interesting to me
[00:31:24] <JBlitzen> With jquery-ui draggable and droppable, they don't consider z-order
[00:31:33] <JBlitzen> So if you have a couple stacked divs, they all get the drop message
[00:31:50] <JBlitzen> Or the first one in HTML order gets the drop message, which has nothing to do with which one is showing on top
[00:32:16] <JBlitzen> Using over and out, you can figure out the current stack of divs under the cursor
[00:32:25] <JBlitzen> But it's not ranked
[00:33:10] <JBlitzen> So while that works if one div is completely enclosed within another and on top of it, it fails if the inner one is behind the outer one, or if they're only partially covering each other
[00:33:43] <JBlitzen> So I think what I'm going to do is to juggle either the z-index on over and out, or I'm going to juggle a separate data value for each div
[00:33:58] <JBlitzen> And I'll set and modify those values on any drag for all objects on the canvas
[00:34:27] <xec_> JBlitzen: are you looking for some help?
[00:34:43] <JBlitzen> So drop one object then another on top of it, first is 1 second is 2.  Pick up the first and drop it again, it's now 3 and then every object above 1 is decremented by 1, so the new order is 1 2 but reversed
[00:34:48] <JBlitzen> Sort of, I'm talking through the issue
[00:35:02] <JBlitzen> I think that last line was the help I needed, I hadn't phrased it yet
[00:35:08] <xec_> maybe make a demo, it's very hard to follow what you're talking about
[00:35:26] <JBlitzen> Think I've got it
[00:35:35] <JBlitzen> Here's a question though
[00:35:48] <JBlitzen> If you need to modify the data value in jquery for, say, thirty divs
[00:35:55] <JBlitzen> What's the performance like?
[00:36:15] <null__> 30 should be fine
[00:36:24] <JBlitzen> k ty
[00:36:31] <null__> you might start worrying around 100-300
[00:36:32] <null__> not sure which
[00:36:33] <JBlitzen> I don't see anyone topping 30 easily
[00:36:35] <null__> it should be easy to test though
[00:36:39] <JBlitzen> nod, true
[00:36:58] <JBlitzen> And I could always simply put a hard limit of only X objects on the canvas at any given time
[00:37:47] <JBlitzen> One last question
[00:37:52] <JBlitzen> Just a brainstorm
[00:38:04] <JBlitzen> With jquery-ui droppable, you can select what kind of intersection that object accepts
[00:38:27] <JBlitzen> Does it trigger a drop event if just the edges of the two objects touch, or does the center of the dragged object have to touch the drop
[00:38:37] <JBlitzen> Is there a way to handle both with separate events?
[00:38:51] <JBlitzen> Well, come to think of it, that'd be easy to determine within the handler
[00:39:09] <JBlitzen> Just check the position of the center of the dragged object vs the size of the current one, everything's a square anyway
[00:39:15] <JBlitzen> k never mind
[00:39:28] <JBlitzen> I don't know how the hell I've gotten into such complex stuff, I've never used jquery before last month
[00:53:52] <JBlitzen> Holy shit it works
[00:55:32] <JBlitzen> No, but it's close
[00:56:24] <JBlitzen> Ah, I see what's up, the dude has a bug
[00:56:36] <JBlitzen> Lemme ask in javascript
[00:57:44] <JBlitzen> Nope, google answered it for me
[00:58:47] <xec_> JBlitzen: nobody even knows what "it" is
[00:58:59] <xec_> JBlitzen: if you have a question, ask it ;)
[00:59:17] <JBlitzen> No question atm
[00:59:30] <JBlitzen> I can explain what's going on if you're curious
[00:59:49] <JBlitzen> It very simply has to do with figuring out which droppable is on top when several are stacked
[01:00:03] <JBlitzen> So that only the topmost droppable is targeted
[01:00:09] <JBlitzen> Make sense?
[01:00:11] <xec_> if you want someone to delve into the issue with you, make a working demo
[01:00:32] <JBlitzen> No question atm
[01:00:35] <JBlitzen> I can explain what's going on if you're curious
[01:00:42] * xec_ sighs
[01:05:32] <JBlitzen> Okay, xec, here's a question though it's javascriptish
[01:05:49] <JBlitzen> How does deleting an element from an associative array work
[01:06:02] <sacho> what's an associate array?
[01:06:03] <xec_> there is no such thing in javascript
[01:06:13] <JBlitzen> Heh
[01:06:14] <xec_> maybe you're talking about an object?
[01:06:17] <sacho> use the delete operator to delete object properties
[01:06:24] <JBlitzen> k ty sacho
[01:08:32] <JBlitzen> Okay, second question
[01:09:17] <JBlitzen> Can an object property... value? ... be an array?
[01:09:30] <hagb4rd> sure
[01:10:17] <JBlitzen> It scares me that I'm even considering this
[01:10:19] <JBlitzen> k ty
[01:10:27] <JBlitzen> Oh
[01:10:30] <JBlitzen> One more question
[01:10:43] <JBlitzen> No, not a question, nm
[01:11:39] <xec_> ahh, the suspense! :)
[01:12:47] <JBlitzen> I was going to ask how to tell whether a property is holding an array or a single integer value
[01:13:13] <JBlitzen> Then I thought I could just store the integers as single element arrays and thus avoid the issue entirely
[01:13:22] <JBlitzen> Though for performance it might be better the first way
[01:13:29] <JBlitzen> Thoughts, xec?
[01:13:34] <JBlitzen> I know you've been itching to answer something
[01:13:44] <xec_> that is true! :D
[01:14:17] <hagb4rd> JBlitzen: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray
[01:14:34] <xec_> depends on what you're  doing, really. why do you want the same property be of different types?
[01:14:39] <JBlitzen> Ah nice, ty hag
[01:14:59] <hagb4rd> btw: the mozilla site is a good source of information
[01:15:00] <xec_> JBlitzen: in any case you can check for number with typeof myvar === "number"
[01:15:16] <JBlitzen> It really does a string compare?  Weird
[01:15:22] <JBlitzen> ty hag
[01:15:28] <sandvige> Hello
[01:15:30] <hagb4rd> you're welcome
[01:15:33] <iolsson> i've just made an AJAX call with $.ajax() and the error callback is invoked but all information i get is... 'error'. i've had a look at the request chain in fiddler and the actual request is fine and i get a http 200 back. how can i get more information about the error?
[01:16:43] <iolsson> the datatype is set to 'xml' and there is xml data returned just fine. may it be a problem that i'm running the code from a local webserver behind a NAT?
[01:17:09] <sacho> test case?
[01:17:45] <iolsson> sacho: you mean you want to see code?
[01:17:57] <sandvige> why $("#error").empty() is not removing <li>...</li> from my <ul id="error"></ul>?
[01:18:19] <sacho> test case?
[01:18:55] <JBlitzen> iolsson
[01:18:56] <JBlitzen> http://encosia.com/use-jquery-to-catch-and-display-aspnet-ajax-service-errors/
[01:19:07] <JBlitzen> That recommends using firebug in firefox to debug the call via breakpoints
[01:19:32] <JBlitzen> And shows how, though I've never tried it so I can't speak to the efficacy
[01:19:41] <hagb4rd> it's great
[01:19:48] <JBlitzen> Nice
[01:20:32] <hagb4rd> you can debug mostly all the way you might be used to in other languages
[01:20:36] <sandvige> I'm getting this error for every ajax calls: "No conversion from text to function", why?
[01:20:49] <iolsson> JBlitzen: thanks, i'll read it straight away
[01:21:23] <iolsson> i'm new to this but i've already tried firebug with call stack, variable inspection and so on, i'm just surprised by how little information jquery provides
[01:21:49] <JBlitzen> I've learned not to be surprised by any technology targeted at web developers
[01:22:17] <tw2113> what sort of stuff were you expecting jQuery to tell you?
[01:22:51] <JBlitzen> Probably the error...
[01:22:56] <hagb4rd> aw, and things sometimes get hard while debugging with some minimized versions of imported JS
[01:22:56] <iolsson> yes :D
[01:23:15] <jaffipaffi> Guys, how would you loop this? http://pastebin.com/qUARdTtv ? I want a loop that loops every object in "dyr", and then I can easily get .name , .latin etc. JSON parsing is all-new for me in jQuery
[01:23:29] <hagb4rd> so it's not recommended using these versions for development
[01:23:46] <iolsson> i would expect something like... why is success not called when everything looks fine in fiddler.. all the data is actually received, the datatype is correct (xml) and so on
[01:25:22] <systemfault> jaffipaffi: Once JSON is parsed, you're left with a normal JS object
[01:25:31] <iolsson> hagb4rd: perhaps you said something there.. i am using the minimal version.. time to try out the debug one. my bad. thanks
[01:25:52] <tw2113> try out the debug one?
[01:26:02] <tw2113> oh you mean the unminified version of jquery?
[01:26:03] <hagb4rd> iolsson: yep
[01:27:58] <jaffipaffi> systemfault: That's nice
[01:28:00] <jaffipaffi> :)
[01:28:04] <jaffipaffi> Will have to play around with it!
[01:28:47] <statusfailed> How can I get a programmatically-controllable crosshair with flot?
[01:29:22] <statusfailed> aaaand I literally just found setCrosshair
[01:30:44] <statusfailed> actually I think that's out of date..
[01:31:12] <statusfailed> nope.
[01:35:16] <iolsson> hmm.. the non-minimised version of jquery didn't give me any more information unfortunately. it seems like i'm stuck with debugging in the jquery source what went wrong. seems a bit hardcore for a beginner :)
[01:35:42] <sandvige> I'm getting this error for every ajax calls: "No conversion from text to function", why?
[01:36:41] <MACscr> ok, so i have a responsive menu that I am working on and its easy to apply css using @media for certain resolutions, but how should i handle jquery only applying at certain resolutions as well?
[01:36:56] <jaffipaffi> sandvige: Are you setting a datatype in the ajax call?
[01:37:04] <MACscr> am i forced to do something like document.body.clientWidth; ?
[01:38:53] <sandvige> jaffipaffi: No, I'm not
[01:39:08] <sandvige> jaffipaffi: should I ?
[01:39:39] <jaffipaffi> sandvige: Nope not if you don't do it. Can you paste your code?
[01:41:19] <raj> I have a table, I'm using TableFilter ( http://www.picnet.com.au/picnet-table-filter.html ) to add the ability to filter. But I'd also like 1) the ability to add rows 2) sort the table by each individual column
[01:41:25] <sandvige> jaffipaffi: http://pastebin.com/tdpmy74r
[01:41:52] <raj> ...and remove rows
[01:43:10] <jaffipaffi> sandvige: At what line?
[01:44:44] <jaffipaffi> sandvige: Hmm I can't see anything wrong with that code unfortunately :/
[01:45:03] <sandvige> jaffipaffi: This is an asynchronous call, it's fired from some internal jQuery code (line 8249 in jquery.js v1.9.1), and it's fired as a result of the call line 7 in the code I pasted
[01:52:09] <JBlitzen> xec, got it working perfectly.  Simple as pie.
[01:52:18] <JBlitzen> Thanks for letting me talk it out
[01:54:03] <sandvige> jaffipaffi: I defined a converter using $.ajaxSetup() this way: "text function": function(a) { return a; }, it fired another error with that: "No conversion from function to ()". So I added another converter: "function ()": function(a) { return a; }, and it fired again another error: "No conversion from () to {". WTF ? :D
[01:54:54] <sandvige> jaffipaffi: now it says "No conversion from { to if"... dafuq jQuery :x
[01:57:20] <atomiku> When I change a page via ajax, $.mobile.changePage(baseURL+'/includes/ajax/event_delete.php');, it changes to that URL in the URL bar, so if I refresh the page I'm refreshing directly into that .php file, rather than perhaps #includes/ajax/.../php
[01:57:26] <atomiku> can I change this behavior somehow?
[01:59:01] <jaffipaffi> sandvige: Haha, it's odd! But I can't see anything wrong :(
[02:00:26] <sandvige> jaffipaffi: I think I get it. I setted a breakpoint in the jQuery converting function, and it seems the available datatypes are... MY ERROR CALLBACK CODE! (splitted on " " (space))
[02:00:28] <sandvige> oO
[02:01:00] <sandvige> jaffipaffi: this is because .post() has no error handler :))
[02:01:11] <sandvige> #nuts :D
[02:03:27] <systemfault> You need to use the promise interface to set a error handler on .post
[02:07:57] <Maoz_> I tried var "$a = $('#myid')", and I understood that $a is a reference, so when $('#myid') updates, $a will update accordingly. What if I want just to save the elements without a reference?
[02:08:48] <Cork> Maoz_: no  $a is a snapshot in time
[02:08:52] <Cork> it does not change
[02:09:41] <Maoz_> oh, ok, thanks
[02:09:58] <Cork> Maoz_: its reference will point to the actual elements in the page though
[02:10:16] <Cork> so if you ex. change the text in an element, it will change in your snapshot too
[02:10:27] <Cork> if you can to clone the elements you use .clone()
[02:11:24] <Maoz_> I would like to append items to the node, and then remove the old items, how would you do it?
[02:14:17] <Cork> Maoz_: just build a list of the items you want and then add them with .html()
[02:14:31] <Cork> or remove them before you start and then append the new ones
[02:14:34] <Maoz_> I though about var $a = $('#myid .items'), append items to $('myid'), and then remove $a, should it work?
[02:14:56] <Cork> why do the hassle of adding first and then removing the old?
[02:14:59] <Cork> just replace them
[02:15:10] <Maoz_> due to animation
[02:16:00] <Cork> you can do something like $('#myid .items').animatedRemove(); $('#myid').append()
[02:16:10] <Cork> animation is async so it will run when your function ends
[02:16:25] <Maoz_> thanks!
[02:16:46] <Cork> btw animatedRemove was a made up name :)
[02:16:57] <Cork> you need to replace it with what ever you use to animate it
[02:17:10] <Maoz_> ok, thanks
[02:21:33] <sahilsk> HI all
[02:22:06] <atomiku> dialog close button X changes URLâ€¦ can I stop this?
[02:22:07] <sahilsk> Hi all
[02:22:15] <atomiku> Even just with $(dialog).close() its still updating the URL
[02:22:55] <systemfault> atomiku:  Has the X button a handler?
[02:23:04] <atomiku> nope
[02:23:14] <atomiku> I could hide it, or override the onclick
[02:23:16] <atomiku> I'd rather override it
[02:24:18] <sahilsk> i need to append my custom html field inside <tr> of a table. thing is i've created  new dom table element using  $myTable = $("<table> <tr></tr></table>");
[02:24:38] <sahilsk> how can do like  $myTable.find("tr").append... ??
[02:24:50] <sahilsk> any help would be great.
[02:25:04] <Cork> sahilsk: you can't append table inside a tr
[02:25:08] <Cork> thats invalid
[02:25:19] <Cork> you need to have a td at around it at least
[02:25:39] <sahilsk> Cork: no no. i'm not appending table inside a table. I want to search for <tr> inside newly created table . I want to append <td> elements
[02:25:53] <Cork> ah
[02:26:02] <Cork> then yes
[02:26:14] <Cork> you can do $myTable.find('tr') to search for the tr
[02:26:19] <sahilsk> thing is currenlty jquery is giving away "NULL" if i do  something like   $myTable.find("tr")...
[02:28:13] <Cork> sahilsk: http://jsfiddle.net/AP3Ht/
[02:28:49] <Cork> opps broken html => fixed http://jsfiddle.net/AP3Ht/1/
[02:29:37] <sahilsk> Cork: it works
[02:30:07] <Cork> so it should :)
[02:30:12] <sahilsk> Cork: see the output in inspector.
[02:30:14] <sahilsk> http://jsfiddle.net/UNp9C/
[02:30:40] <sahilsk> though it's printing what i need . however, it says parent is null..blha blah blah.. perhaps something wrong with jsfiddle
[02:31:01] <Cork> sahilsk: ehh... why serialize the td and then append it again....
[02:31:54] <Cork> sahilsk: why not just do http://jsfiddle.net/UNp9C/1/ ?
[02:31:59] <sahilsk> Cork:  i need to make one column's CSS position : fixed to allow its visibility on horizontal scrolling of a very horizontally long table
[02:32:21] <Cork> or even better http://jsfiddle.net/UNp9C/2/
[02:32:31] <atomiku> With jQuery mobile, I changePage('external.php', {changeHash:false});, and when I open up a dialog on this ajax loaded page, after it closes it changes the url to external.php. this isn't good as if they refresh it takes them completely away from the main jquery app
[02:33:01] <sahilsk> Cork: wow. I like the last snippet you sent. it's a good.
[02:34:01] <rabbi1> working on a advanced search with the help of existing search feature... http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/gSgxv/5/  Can some one help where I am going wrong ... ? need help
[02:34:23] <lobbin> Is it possible to create a checkbox without icon in JQM?
[02:36:26] <rabbi1> Cork: hey, how are you? long time :)
[02:36:57] <Cork> fiddling with rails 3.2/4 security models
[02:37:05] <rabbi1> kool
[02:37:06] <Cork> (not too much fun)
[02:37:29] <Cork> they have to radically different ideas for the two versions
[02:38:04] <rabbi1> updation  issues ?
[02:38:25] <Cork> attr_accessible/attr_protected vs strong_params
[02:38:33] <Cork> (offtopic for this channel though)
[02:38:56] <rabbi1> will stop for now then ... :)
[02:41:10] <rabbi1> Cork: have a nice time though ....
[02:51:22] <atomiku> With changePage('ajax/load_dynamic_ui_page.php'), why does it need to change the hash? I mean, okay I can use changeHash:false then it all works as intended (I guess), but then when I try and open a dialog from that load_dynamic_ui_page.php, it changes the url to ajax/laod_dynamic_ui_page.php when it closes
[02:51:31] <atomiku> Two options now I suppose...
[02:52:09] <atomiku> A) write a custom plugin, so instead of changePage I will have to have a link to: #ajax/load_dynamic_ui_page.php?var=1&foo=bar
[02:52:16] <atomiku> B) make my own dialog and use fadeIn fadeOut
[02:52:19] <atomiku> what can I do?
[02:52:43] <atomiku> ive spent 70% of the time on this project figuring out quirks/getting things to work the way I want :/
[03:12:02] <krz> why oh why is jquery autocomplete auto sorting results!
[03:12:07] <krz> what is the logic there!?
[03:13:14] <Adys_> krz: sortResults: false
[03:13:21] <krz> doesn't do jack
[03:13:37] <krz> and where does it specify that in the doc?
[03:13:53] <Adys> I just googled: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10948911/jquery-autocomplete-order-of-results
[03:13:59] <krz> i tried that

[03:14:17] <krz> all three
[03:14:46] <Adys> https://github.com/dyve/jquery-autocomplete/blob/master/src/jquery.autocomplete.js#L748
[03:15:13] <Adys> you sure sortResults doesnt do anything?
[03:15:21] <Adys> try passing a noop to sortFunction
[03:15:38] <krz> noop?
[03:15:57] <Cork> Adys: thats not the code used in jquery-ui
[03:16:19] <krz> let me try again
[03:16:21] <Adys> that would explain it
[03:16:52] <Adys> no mention of sorting in here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js
[03:17:32] <Cork> ya, i've been looking at the code too
[03:17:38] <Cork> and i can't find any sorting in there either
[03:19:01] <Adys> http://paste2.org/p/3018953 could someone explain why the onclick doesn't update to the other function when one of them is triggered?
[03:20:03] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L422
[03:20:08] <Adys> i have an <a class="follow">, the .follow onclick triggers and works fine, but when it's set to .unfollow it still triggers the .follow event
[03:20:11] <Cork> thats all preparation autocompete does
[03:20:42] <Cork> Adys: the selector is point in time
[03:20:51] <Cork> it doesn't look for it
[03:20:59] <Cork> its a match and then its a list of elements
[03:21:12] <Adys> Cork: any way to get the behaviour i want?
[03:21:15] <Cork> if you want it to react to the class change
[03:21:21] <Adys> without duplicating the code
[03:21:22] <Cork> you should use delegated event listeners
[03:21:42] <Cork> $('parent').on('click', '.follow', function() {});
[03:22:06] <Cork> or do it all in one handler and check $(this).hasClass('follow')
[03:22:36] <Adys> hmm thats a better idea yeah
[03:22:47] <Adys> $([".foo", ".bar"], ...) works yeah?
[03:22:51] <Cork> you should still use delegated event listners though
[03:22:54] <Cork> no
[03:23:03] <Cork> its $('.foo, .bar')
[03:23:08] <Adys> oh yeah
[03:23:11] <Adys> I'm an idiot =\
[03:23:24] <Cork> but like i said, you should be using delegated event listeners instead
[03:23:37] <Cork> ex. $(document).on('click', 'selector', function() {})
[03:24:07] <Cork> that way you only get one event listener for everything instead of possible hundreds of event listners
[03:24:11] <Cork> *listeners
[03:24:47] <Adys> interesting, you'd think jquery would do that optimizaton for the user
[03:24:56] <Cork> it can't
[03:25:15] <Cork> and in some cases you don't want delegated event listeners
[03:25:39] <Cork> but matching multiple events and doing the same thing on all of them is sub optimal
[03:26:06] <Cork> Adys: $() makes a search, it generates an array of elements; thats all it does
[03:26:23] <Adys> oh yeah i see
[03:26:25] <Cork> .on then loops over that array and adds an event listener to each element in that array
[03:26:38] <Cork> thats why it can't be optimized from that direction
[03:26:44] <Adys> makes sense
[03:26:57] <Cork> (thats what live did, and it had horrible performance cause of it)
[03:27:16] <Cork> cause it did $() found all elements it could find
[03:27:50] <Cork> then .live ignored the list $() generated, and instead asked for the selector it had been given
[03:27:54] <Cork> and then it binds on document and used that selector
[03:28:15] <Cork> (and thats why its been deprecated and removed)
[03:48:37] <Ov3rTaf> hi
[03:52:20] <chase-work> hay
[03:59:13] <MalMen> $("#groups").empty(); to empty a all selectbox, now i«how can i empty all the data except the first one ?
[04:00:48] <sandvige> Why ajaxStop() is not fired when an ajaxError() is fired? (after a failing call to ajax())
[04:01:01] <Clex> MalMen: you are selecting an id. It cannot be more than one element.
[04:01:20] <MalMen> the id is the selectbox
[04:01:26] <sandvige> Clex: if #groups is a <ul>, I think he want to delete every items except the first
[04:01:32] <Clex> MalMen: children then?
[04:01:34] <MalMen> now i want to delete all options on that selectbox, but still have the first one intact
[04:01:45] <Clex> MalMen: $('#groups').children().gt(0).remove()
[04:02:46] <keirlav87> I feel like I've lost sight of the wood because of the trees with this simple little function - basically all I want to do is return an array of the next 12 months, it works but have i've turned a simple func into a laborious task? because it feels alittle that way - http://jsfiddle.net/yEZfE/4/
[04:02:57] <keirlav87> have I*
[04:03:40] <MalMen> TypeError: $(...).children(...).gt is not a function
[04:04:26] <Clex> $('#groups').children(':gt(0)').remove()
[04:04:48] <chase-work> i have some jquery that preforms a click() (which remote posts) on a its children if they aren't already active, the clicks are firing too quickly and not all are getting posts. how would I get each to wait until the prior clicks post has returned?
[04:05:24] <MalMen> thanks :)
[04:06:03] <sandvige> Clex: do you have any clue why ajaxStop() is not fired if an ajax() call fires an ajaxError() ?
[04:06:59] <Clex> Is it supposed to be called on error?
[04:07:36] <sandvige> Clex: well, if an error occur, ajaxStop() should be called since ajax is _really_ stopped, no?
[04:07:58] <sandvige> Clex: there is nothing in the docs says ajaxStop() won't be fired if an ajaxError() is trigged
[04:08:52] <Clex> Indeed, that's not documented. Why don't you check out on jQuery's source code?
[04:10:13] <sandvige> Clex: because there is a doc! :D Well, I'm quite new to jQuery, and I didn't know the documentation wasn't complete :)
[04:10:20] <sandvige> Clex: I will read the code, thanks
[04:24:57] <keirlav87> so can anyone tell me if i've gone around the houses with this function and missed the obvious route? http://jsfiddle.net/yEZfE/6/
[04:26:01] <Che-Anarc> In jQM what can action can / how can I bind: I can do $( "#dialog" ).close( function(err){ alert("removed dialog"); } ); - I am trying to dynamically remove certian dialogs in pages where they are present.
[04:33:08] <tanmayk> bot?
[04:45:03] <sahbeewah> anybody know why i can't talk in ##javascript?
[04:45:43] <sandvige> sahbeewah: read the topic
[04:46:10] <sandvige> Is jQuery providing something to poll javascript error and send them to the server?
[04:46:40] <sahbeewah> oh alright thanks
[04:52:29] <varnie> hi there
[04:52:48] <varnie> why does the following simple piece of code gives wrong results in IE and FF? http://jsfiddle.net/rvMht/
[04:53:02] <varnie> FF says "false" and IE says "true"!!!
[04:53:25] <varnie> what is a proper way to check whether property 'checked' is set or not?
[04:54:11] <Cork> varnie: prop('checked')
[04:54:43] <varnie> yes, it is so. but IE alerts true
[04:54:57] <varnie> it thinks that it is not checked
[04:55:08] <Cork> uh...
[04:55:18] <Cork> you can't have checked on a type hidden
[04:55:30] <Cork> thats for radio and checkbox
[04:56:10] <Cork> type="hidden" only have value=""
[04:56:11] <sandvige> http://www.muscula.com/
[04:56:15] <sandvige> this is what I was looking for :)
[04:56:38] <varnie> thank you, Cork. didn't know that. so I should rewrite it...
[04:58:13] <Cork> varnie: i'm actually a bit scared that firefox even gives you the false there...
[04:58:38] <Cork> i would actually expect undefined from both
[04:58:46] <Cork> or possibly "checked"
[05:01:33] <seutje> Cork: he's typecasting with !
[05:01:48] <Cork> ah
[05:01:59] <Cork> js> !"checked"
[05:02:02] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:02:06] <seutje> gotsa print!
[05:02:07] <Cork> ?eval !"checked"
[05:02:12] <bot-t> Cork: false
[05:02:16] * Cork nods
[05:02:16] <seutje> js> print(!'checked')
[05:02:18] <b-ot> seutje: false
[05:02:21] <Cork> ok, that makes sense
[05:02:53] <seutje> gotta love bool attributes
[05:02:59] <Che-Anarc> What event can I bind to to catch close action of a dialog in jQM ?
[05:03:59] <Cork> O_o
[05:04:08] <Cork> wtf...
[05:04:19] <Cork> http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=do+the+harlem+shake <-- just got this one sent to me...
[05:04:44] <grafi> its awesome isnt it Cork .p
[05:05:02] <Cork> someone has been having fun for sure...
[05:05:54] <grafi> that should be a jquery plugin
[05:08:30] <sahbeewah> is that a jquery bot
[05:08:55] <sahbeewah> js> $ === jQuery
[05:08:58] <b-ot> sahbeewah: No output.
[05:10:40] <sahbeewah> do you guys know if jquery supports documentfragments
[05:16:05] <pedda> hi there
[05:16:23] <pedda> can someone tell me the buzzword for twitter bootstraps scrollspy functionality?
[05:16:31] <pedda> i'm looking for an alternative plugin
[05:20:18] <SebastianG_> I use jQuery inside Node.js and I have problems jQ's handling of script elements. jQ does not append them to the DOM and doesn't print them when calling .html(). Can this feature be disabled somehow?
[05:23:11] <xiphiasx_> so
[05:24:45] <Cork> SebastianG_: no, cause you will get unexpected effects if you do
[05:24:55] <Cork> ex, moving an element will suddenly run the script again
[05:24:59] <Cork> and so on
[05:25:20] <Cork> SebastianG_: so jquery grabs the script elements and inserts it in head instead
[05:25:48] <Cork> this should normally not be a problem, as long as the script is written unobstructively
[05:26:25] <Cork> sahbeewah: yes jquery support fragments, its what it uses when you parse html with jquery
[05:27:00] <Cork> ex. $('<table><tr><td>something</td></tr></table>')[0] <-- a dom fragment
[05:28:00] <SebastianG_> So when I modify my page server-side with jQuery, there is no way to add a script element that will be executed after the markup is send to the client?
[05:28:22] <Cork> SebastianG_: not with jquery no
[05:28:36] <Cork> you can with [].innerHTML though
[05:28:42] <SebastianG_> Ok, thank you
[05:29:01] <Cork> but be careful cause if you ever touch that element it will execute again
[05:30:49] <jokke> hello! I'm defining some css styles in my jquery app with the css() function. Can i somehow manage to change only values that haven't been set specifically in a stylesheet?
[05:31:28] <jokke> that way the user would be left with some way to configure the style of the app
[05:32:06] <xiphiasx_> hi
[05:32:16] <xiphiasx_> when using jquery mobile
[05:32:21] <jokke> it would also suffice to reload the stylesheets after the css() functions.
[05:32:32] <xiphiasx_> i can click on things locally
[05:32:58] <xiphiasx_> but when it gets to pmy phone (this is a phonegap app), i can't click on anything
[05:34:01] <Cork> jokke: no, if you want that your better of moving the css values to a css file, and use a class instead
[05:34:06] <Cork> jokke: then you can do it
[05:34:55] <Cork> jokke: css values should be in the css files, that makes life a hole lot simpler (unless you temporary need to set them for animation)
[05:36:25] <jokke> Cork: well the problem is, that i don't know the identifiers (classes and id's) in beforehand.
[05:36:45] <jokke> it's up to the user
[05:37:06] <sahbeewah> would you agree that anything found by .children() should be found by .find()
[05:37:07] <Cork> jokke: so give them a js file and a css (base rule) file
[05:37:26] <Cork> jokke: that makes it easier for them if they want to override what you normally do
[05:37:43] <jokke> meh..
[05:39:36] <sahbeewah> think i found a bug in query: http://jsfiddle.net/w7KFN/
[05:39:41] <sahbeewah> jquery, rather
[05:52:54] <hemanth_> ("#id >li") vs ("#id").children("li") ??
[05:57:16] <seutje> sahbeewah: if only the docs mentioned support for passing document fragments into the jQueries
[05:57:43] <seutje> but they don't, so u can't really call it a bug, more like possible room for improvement
[05:59:12] <seutje> hemanth_: use http://jsperf.com and see for urself
[05:59:38] <hemanth_> seutje, lazy me ...was expecting a quick ans
[05:59:58] <seutje> I'd say the second is faster
[06:00:07] <seutje> cause of the getElementById shortcut
[06:00:47] <seutje> well, I guess it depends on the browser's QSA speed, prolly
[06:03:13] <hemanth_> seutje, hmm
[06:05:44] <devswap> I am using a jquery library which keeps rewriting an a href (its a ticker) and I wish to disable the click action on it. preventDefault(); works for all links on the page bar the ticker where the links are continually re-written - is there a way around this?
[06:11:31] <amcsi_work> I'm trying to explain delegating events in jquery to someone. I wrote him something that seems clear, but may be inaccurate. Please tell me whether I am incorrect: http://pastebin.com/CZjRj5UV
[06:16:16] <seutje> amcsi_work: I believe it also does a separate check to see if the target itself matches the selector
[06:20:55] <amcsi_work> closest does match against the element itself
[06:21:23] <amcsi_work> although I seem to be wrong in the sense that if multiple elements match, then the handler is called for each
[06:21:52] <seutje> oh it does, my bad, haven't been up-to-date with these new versions
[06:22:06] <amcsi_work> so $(evt.target).parents(selectot).andSelf(); is called, and is iterated
[06:23:06] <seutje> ur example seems accurate though
[06:23:26] <seutje> closest will always only return 1 element when called on a collection of a single element
[06:23:52] <seutje> and ur explicitly setting the currenttarget to the first result, and only calling it once if there was any result
[06:25:02] <QKO|Work> does .empty() do a delete or a detach?
[06:25:29] <quazimodo> can anyone imagine a way to wrap highlighted text in a span ?
[06:26:04] <quazimodo> to automatically do it as the highlighting occurs, that is
[06:26:22] <quazimodo> i guess the more direct question is, is there a method that triggers as each piece of text is highlighted?
[06:28:01] <seutje> prolly not standardized and implemented by a whole lotta browsers
[06:28:21] <seutje> so it'll be like, every mousemove after a mousedown before a mouseup
[06:28:38] <seutje> just getting the bloody selection range is a PITA cross-browser
[06:32:15] <Che-Anarc> How to get invite to #jquerymobile ?
[06:35:03] <quazimodo> seutje: yeah it does seem a bit difficult
[06:35:16] <quazimodo> I'm looking at jquery caret, know much about it?
[06:35:19] <quazimodo> it seems to do the job
[06:37:08] <seutje> can't say I have any experience with it
[06:39:44] <quazimodo> LOL suetje
[06:40:19] <quazimodo> the reason I wanted to do it was to be able to highlight some text in some box, then drag it into another box. ALREADY HAPPENS ON THE BROWSER!!!!
[06:40:26] * quazimodo is overjoyed
[06:40:56] <Che-Anarc> In jquery mobile what event can I bind to a dialog so as to remove it from document / dom after it has lost focus or been closed?
[06:51:52] <quazimodo> holy crap
[06:51:56] <quazimodo> jquery is an amazing thing
[06:52:05] <quazimodo> I don't know who's idea this thing was
[06:52:08] <quazimodo> but ... just bravo
[06:52:12] <TonyDusk> hi, having trouble animating div by name stead of tag: http://jsfiddle.net/gJHUk/14/
[06:52:17] <jrajav> Hey Mikey I think he likes it
[06:52:21] <pachet> quazimodo: john resig :[
[06:52:54] <jrajav> TonyDusk: To select by id you need to use #
[06:52:59] <jrajav> $('#red')
[06:53:07] <jrajav> Just like with CSS selectors.
[06:53:23] <jrajav> Alternatively, you could select by class with .
[06:53:26] <quicksilver> and id means id, whilst name means name ;)
[06:53:27] <jrajav> $('.red')
[06:53:58] <TonyDusk> oversight.. thanks jrajav
[06:59:24] <Jonno_FTW> hi
[06:59:48] <pachet> hi
[07:00:00] <Jonno_FTW> how do I get the text after a node, ie "<a>link</a>some text", how do I get "some text"?
[07:01:10] <raj> I have a table, I'm using TableFilter ( http://www.picnet.com.au/picnet-table-filter.html ) to add the ability to filter. But I'd also like 1) the ability to add and remove rows 2) sort the table by each individual column
[07:01:15] <quazimodo> hrm
[07:01:18] <quazimodo> timeglider is fantastic
[07:01:38] <quazimodo> anyone know a project like timeglider that's got an open library?
[07:04:45] <pachet> Jonno_FTW: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6925088/get-the-text-after-span-element-using-jquery
[07:04:48] <pachet> first answer
[07:05:38] <pachet> if your case is more specific than that then you can probably get a little better performance using regex on the innerHTML of the parent
[07:05:46] <pachet> depending on how much other stuff is in that parent
[07:08:04] <bolshchikov> http://jsbin.com/eqajup/1/edit
[07:15:56] <Dieterbe> hey guy, i have a list of urls (generated dynamically); i would like to do ajax calls for each url and work with the results when they are all done
[07:16:13] <Dieterbe> normally i would use $.when() but then i would need to hardcode the individual ajax calls
[07:16:37] <raj> Dieterbe, not sure what you're asking
[07:16:53] <raj> can you restate your question, guy?
[07:17:36] <Dieterbe> ok, so i have urls like ['http://server/data?query=foo', 'http://server/data?query=bar', 'http://server/data?query=meh']
[07:17:43] <Dieterbe> this list is generated dynamically
[07:18:01] <Dieterbe> i need a way to do all these requests in the background, and process (merge) their results
[07:20:09] <raj> $.on('click', '.myurls', function(ev) {var url=$(e.target).attr('href'); $.ajax({'url':url, 'data':"{'mydata':'ishere'}"})     })
[07:20:43] <raj> oops. $(document).on(...)
[07:21:31] <raj> shoky?
[07:21:41] <Dieterbe> i need to do initiate all requests at the same time, wait for them all to complete, then process all results at once
[07:22:29] <raj> so then you need a promise object
[07:22:44] <raj> which I sadly know nothing about yet cuz I've never used it
[07:31:14] <jiko> why don't you chain it instead?
[07:31:29] <raj> it'll still fire one after the other
[07:31:50] <dcherman2> Dieterbe: see ?when
[07:31:51] <bot-t> Dieterbe, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[07:32:10] <Dieterbe> jiko: cause that's way too slow
[07:32:24] <raj> anyone have extensive use with tables?
[07:32:30] <Dieterbe> i think this is what i need: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9865586/jquery-when-troubleshooting-with-variable-number-of-arguments
[07:32:31] <raj> I need a good plugin
[07:32:44] <Dieterbe> using when() is simple, using it with a variable number of args (dynamically computed) is harder
[07:32:46] <BillCriswell> raj: What do you need a good plugin for?
[07:33:11] <raj> I have a table, I'm using TableFilter ( http://www.picnet.com.au/picnet-table-filter.html ) to add the ability to filter. But I'd also like 1) the ability to add and remove rows 2) sort the table by each individual column
[07:33:21] <dcherman2> Dieterbe: how so - you just want the first argument from your done functions i assume?
[07:33:25] <BillCriswell> Dieterbe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1316371/converting-a-javascript-array-to-a-function-arguments-list
[07:34:29] <jiko> deiterbe: can you combine the requests into one before it hits the server?
[07:34:45] <Dieterbe> dcherman2: no, like i said, i need to execute a variable number of ajax requests, the list of urls i need to query is dynamically computed
[07:34:53] <Dieterbe> jiko: no....
[07:35:06] <jiko> well, the example you used all had the same processor
[07:35:43] <BillCriswell> Dieterbe: $.when.apply(null, requests)
[07:35:54] <dcherman2> Dieterbe: var requests = $.map( urls, function( url ) { return $.ajax( url ) });  $.when.apply( $, requests );
[07:36:02] <Dieterbe> yeah, thanks, i'm looking into apply, it seems to be what i need
[07:37:42] <raj> any idea BillCriswell?
[07:38:43] <BillCriswell> raj: I'd use something that offers all those features instead.
[07:38:53] <BillCriswell> http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-filter.html seems like it'll do the job.
[07:40:46] <granden> If I get "Access to restricted URI denied.  " when trying to load a js file that is on the same server
[07:41:01] <granden> using /js/javascriptplugins.js as the adress for it.
[07:41:04] <granden> What could be the problem?
[07:41:14] <BillCriswell> granden: Can you access it directly from your browser?
[07:41:29] <raj> awesome, thank you
[07:42:21] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:42:47] <granden> BillCriswell: Yes, but it only a few browsers that gives that error, firefox and chrome are the once giving the error
[07:44:45] <jiko> where are you seeing the error, in firebug?
[07:44:47] <granden> jiko: Yes
[07:44:58] <BillCriswell> granden: How are you trying to load the script?
[07:45:08] <BillCriswell> Just <script src="foo.js"></script>?
[07:45:08] <granden> <script> thag
[07:45:09] <granden> tag*
[07:45:36] <jiko> is the plugin script loading external scripts?
[07:45:48] <granden> No
[07:45:56] <granden> I just named it plugin but its only js code in it. Not loading anything else.
[07:46:27] <BillCriswell> Does the author suggest linking directly to the file?
[07:47:12] <BillCriswell> They could be blocking it from other domains.
[07:47:25] <granden> Sorry to have taken upp your time. But I just noticed that a css file in the same folder did not load with the same error message as wel.l
[07:47:25] <Guest96425> hello everyone.. anyone here know about the tabs widget?
[07:47:29] <granden> So not js related then.
[07:49:44] <tubbo> hey guys, is there a way to 'prepend' $.ajax(url: '..') with something? like say I have a lot of calls like $.get('/posts/1'), but i want to change what host they're being sent to (say, in a 'stage' or 'production' environment)
[07:49:53] <tubbo> is there a way to do that with the $.ajax config?
[07:50:29] <Guest96425> will try rephrasing.. I am trying to switch focus to another tab using the Tabs Widget without doing an onclick event .. is there another way to do this?
[07:50:58] <systemfault> tubbo: Can't you use paths that start with / ?
[07:51:13] <systemfault> tubbo: Do you really need to set the full url?
[07:55:33] <Guest96425> anyone actually here?
[07:55:49] <systemfault> Nope.
[07:55:55] <Guest96425> worthless
[07:56:02] <systemfault> We're 929 bots.
[07:56:06] <Guest96425> great impression
[07:56:06] <systemfault> Including me.
[07:56:37] <BillCriswell> Hahaha.
[07:56:38] <Guest96425> the web site is BS
[07:56:48] <BillCriswell> systemfault's AI is TOP notch.
[07:56:59] <Guest96425> no they are
[07:57:02] <Guest96425> aren't
[07:57:23] <systemfault> Guest89537: Seriously, if you have a question, just ask it. Our bot array will analyze and you might get an answer.
[07:57:31] <Guest96425> if this is how you treat people who use this and spread the word to see it grow then you all are doing a piss poor job
[07:57:47] <Guest96425> I did ask .. twice.. not even a response
[07:58:19] <BillCriswell> Guest96425: You're certainly using a great approach to get help.
[07:58:33] <Guest96425> I asked nicely and was ignored
[07:58:34] <yogurt_truck> Guest96425: ask thrice
[07:58:34] <systemfault> Guest96425: Nobody's paid to help hereâ€¦ and jQuery is a lot more popular than jQueryUI.
[07:58:52] <systemfault> If you had a jQuery question, it would probably be answered by now.
[07:59:13] <Guest96425> in fact asked twice.. not even an acknowledgement yet someone comes in after me and gets at least a response
[07:59:19] <ekpyrotic> Guys, at the moment. I have a slider. It's a longer series of images, and at intervals the margin-left changes, and they all scroll along.
[07:59:21] <Guest96425> I did have
[07:59:32] <BillCriswell> I thought it was clever.
[07:59:35] <Guest96425> Jquery UI Tabs Widget..
[07:59:46] <ekpyrotic> However, I'm having performance issues because it's animating all the images.
[07:59:55] <Guest96425> anyone know about the Tabs Widget? NO RESPONSE
[07:59:55] <ekpyrotic> Is there a better way to do this?
[08:00:14] <BillCriswell> Guest96425: Give people a minute.
[08:01:15] <Guest96425> I even rephrased in case my question wasn't clear
[08:01:18] <NoiseEee> Guest96425: ask a specific question, pastebin appropriate code, and perhaps when someone is taking a break from their paying job, they'll help you
[08:01:31] <yogurt_truck> Guest96425: and try being specific. "Anyone know about ...." is an annoying question. Ask directly "why is my jquery ui tab not activating X thing? here's a jsfiddle to my code"
[08:02:12] <ovnicraft> Hello i am working with existing OSS project and this has a checkbox option in UI, the function what runs is bind here https://gist.github.com/ovnicraft/5065587 so in wat to know how i can debug or find where i can bind the unselect in checkbox.
[08:02:50] <ovnicraft> the call stack runs first JQuery.event.handle then the method bind 'selected'
[08:02:55] <Guest96425> How can I change set the focus to another tab in the JQuery UI Tabs Widget?
[08:03:04] <ovnicraft> how i can debug to identify this ?
[08:03:40] <BillCriswell> Guest96425: You can do .tabs('select', index) I believe.
[08:04:03] <Guest96425> ty BillCriswell .. will try that
[08:04:17] <BillCriswell> Ah that's old UI. Do .tabs('option', 'active', index)
[08:04:37] <devswap> i am presuming if you do a selector for an item that isnt created yet and then it is created that the selector is ignored - is this correct?
[08:05:08] <BillCriswell> devswap: Yeah, you'd have to select it after it's added.
[08:05:56] <devswap> billcriswell: problem is that a jquery plugin works by continually removing and recreating items so I am guessing there is no way to get a selector on those items?
[08:06:55] <ekpyrotic> Guys, at the moment. I have a slider. It's a longer series of images, and at intervals the margin-left changes, and they all scroll along. However, I'm having performance issues because it's animating all the images at once. Is there a better way to do this?
[08:06:55] <Guest96425> tried the .tabs('option', 'active', index) before coming here.. focus didn't change so wondered if the index example referred to setting active to true instead
[08:07:32] <BillCriswell> devswap: As far as I know you'd have to run through the items on a certain event again and detect if the plugin is applied.
[08:07:50] <devswap> billcriswell: ok thanks
[08:11:11] <BillCriswell> Guest96425: Hmmm... I'm not super familiar with UI, but could you do like $('.ui-selected-active-or-whatever').trigger('focus') after you use .tabs('option', 'active', foo);
[08:11:42] <agrach> http://jsfiddle.net/agrach/drQTZ/   dear seirs, could you help with fadeOut method?
[08:11:52] <agrach> *sirs
[08:11:58] <Guest96425> ty again BillCriswell .. turns out it was my bad.. code to iterate through an array failed before my call to set the tab

[08:32:02] <BillCriswell> I'm really gas for SASS.
[08:32:03] <agrach> http://jsfiddle.net/g4afU/ - doesn't fade out just lives visible.. my element in original code has notation "parelem.children[1]" don't feel confident to turn it to something beginning with $
[08:32:05] <BillCriswell> gay*
[08:34:35] <BillCriswell> It's CSS stuff, but really awesome at the same time.
[08:34:59] <tubbo> BillCriswell: i haven't written actual CSS in almost 2 years
[08:35:04] <tubbo> SCSS is perfect.
[08:35:17] <BillCriswell> tubbo: Same. I couldn't agree more.
[08:35:39] <pachet> gas for sass has a better ring to it
[08:37:14] <BillCriswell> pachet: I concur. I regret correcting it.
[08:38:48] <noobito> anyone here? i need some help
[08:39:29] <BillCriswell> noobito: Just ask.
[08:41:45] <bmcc75> noobito: sup
[08:42:03] <noobito> i not very experienced with this. but ihave this jquery program inside an iframe.
[08:42:23] <agrach> BillCriswell: is such syntax correct at all?
[08:42:24] <agrach> http://jsfiddle.net/agrach/kayFv/
[08:42:48] <agrach> parelem.children[1] - is a normal button
[08:42:49] <BillCriswell> agrach: No.
[08:42:51] <noobito> this program uses json from and such. everytime i end the session with a button ( sending them to another page ) a popup always come saying are you sure you wanna leave this place?
[08:43:53] <BillCriswell> agrach: Why not just do $('.parent button').on('click', function(){ .... });
[08:46:38] <BillCriswell> noobito: Hmm.. are you editing an input or a textarea before you click the button?
[08:48:21] <noobito> now that u mention it i edit a hidden text input
[08:48:31] <noobito> would that be the problem?
[08:51:39] <BillCriswell> noobito: It could be. I see it happen on facebook and gmail and shit. I always thought it was specific to their apps.. now I'm thinking it's just Chrome ahha.
[08:51:46] <jiko> noobito: window.onbeforeunload is being called somewhere
[08:52:37] <noobito> ill try to check for that. too jiko be back when confirm
[08:53:27] <NoiseEee> noobito: thats whats causing it / the only thing causing it.
[08:53:35] <jiko> ^
[08:53:46] <jiko> yeah, it's not a matter of "if" it's a matter of "where"
[09:00:05] <CIDIC> is there some trick to get the css top value of an element?
[09:00:08] <CIDIC> I am getting auto but that is not what is set
[09:02:56] <pythonsnake> whats a cool file uploader lib?
[09:03:47] <djQuery> morning
[09:04:04] <noobito> BillCriswell: jiko NoiseEee .. thx guys.. it was one of the jQuery plugins binding the beforeunload
[09:04:27] <pythonsnake> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ is it ok?
[09:04:42] <CIDIC> the php part is written poorly other than that it is pretty good
[09:05:36] <pythonsnake> CIDIC: whats a decent one with multiple file upload and drag&drop support?
[09:05:40] <pythonsnake> and progress bar
[09:05:47] <CIDIC> pythonsnake: that one
[09:06:20] <pythonsnake> ok thx
[09:26:00] <scar> when im having a window fly out from the right side of the screen, it works, but when i close it and push it back, it doesnt go away. it creates a horizontal scrollbar
[09:26:42] <AskMP> Raise your hand if youâ€™re going to the now sold out jQueryTO this weekend.
[09:29:42] <NoiseEee> word!
[09:29:46] <NoiseEee> er, hand
[09:43:13] <gotwig> hey
[09:43:18] <gotwig> why cant I just use e.g $("#toggle").attr('checked', true); to check a checkbox ??
[09:43:27] <gotwig> my input checkbox has the id toggle
[09:43:34] <gotwig> but it doesnt work: http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/
[09:43:42] <imsky> use .prop not .attr
[09:43:51] <imsky> you'd have to use .attr("checked", "checked")
[09:44:05] <gotwig> I mean, the css does not react.
[09:44:53] <agrach> http://jsfiddle.net/agrach/drQTZ/3/
[09:45:05] <agrach> to BillCriswell
[09:45:13] <gotwig> imsky: css does not respond
[09:45:46] <imsky> what css
[09:46:11] <gotwig> imsky: on my site?? :checked
[09:46:15] <gotwig> psuedo element
[09:46:21] <trypwire1> hey all, is this an appropriate place to ask questions about qunit?
[09:46:47] <imsky> gotwig, what exactly does your css do
[09:46:56] <gotwig> imsky: check if the checkbox is checked
[09:47:20] <imsky> what checkbox
[09:47:36] <gotwig> #toggle
[09:48:52] <imsky> what sort of styles are you setting on this checkbox
[09:49:10] <gotwig> nothing special
[09:49:14] <gotwig> :/
[09:49:16] <imsky> like.
[09:49:33] <gotwig> you can even look at my code, dude.
[09:49:48] <NoiseEee> gotwig: $('#someCheckbox').prop('checked',true)
[09:49:49] <imsky> ok dude http://jsfiddle.net/G5Kay/
[09:50:22] <gotwig> i think css just does not react to jquery, dom changes
[09:50:30] <imsky> did you see my jsfiddle
[09:50:34] <imsky> css reacts fine
[09:50:35] <NoiseEee> gotwig: you're wrong.
[09:50:46] <gotwig> NoiseEee: take a look at my site
[09:50:55] <gotwig> NoiseEee: try to execute via javascript terminal
[09:51:28] <NoiseEee> gotwig: i'm not going to look at your site, you're obviously doing something wrong. what YOU should be doign is looking at imsky's jsfiddle
[09:51:43] <gotwig> NoiseEee: I did that. And I see that it works.
[09:52:33] <NoiseEee> gotwig: so.... somewhere you've got some problems.
[09:52:49] <gotwig> oh really?
[09:53:50] <imsky> :(
[09:54:06] <gotwig> ^ thats how I feel
[09:54:19] <keirlav87> gotwig: on your page i'm seeing this printed on the scree - script type="text/javascript">$("#toggle").attr("checked", "checked");
[09:54:46] <gotwig> keirlav87: yeah, I have to execute it
[09:56:10] <keirlav87> gotwig I don't understand - why do you have that at the top of your document?
[09:56:35] <NoiseEee> where is this document?
[09:56:47] <gotwig> keirlav87: I wanted to execute that thing
[09:56:57] <gotwig> now its away, I have to initialize somehow jquery I guess
[09:57:17] <keirlav87> yeah but it should be enclosed properly in script tags and below your jquery script
[09:58:04] <keirlav87> what you have is missing the opening '<' from the script tags, and placed above jquery - the $ symbol will be meaningless to it
[09:58:13] <keirlav87> it should also have a doc ready statement preceding it
[09:58:30] <keirlav87> so that the element #toggle is available when the statement is executed
[09:58:39] <gotwig> how can I do it easily via javascript..?
[09:59:15] <gotwig> keirlav87: yeah I see what you mean
[09:59:27] <keirlav87> this is really quite fundamental stuff and I'd recommend you look at something like this first - http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/jquery-for-absolute-beginners-video-series/
[10:00:58] <gotwig> keirlav87: go home.
[10:01:19] <keirlav87> lol
[10:01:26] <gotwig> keirlav87: I try my stuff via the javascript terminal, all the time, I do not want to include code, that actually doesnt work in the terminal either
[10:02:07] <gotwig> css does not react on that, thats what I mean
[10:02:13] <q[corwin]> gotwig, I do okay with Email and JS-IDE mode, but lots more mileage from JSFiddle and the like
[10:02:25] <q[corwin]> s/Email/emacs/ #stupid fingers
[10:03:02] <gotwig> and you suggestion is just pure irony.
[10:03:03] <keirlav87> css does what react on what? the checkbox with id of toggle?
[10:03:25] <keirlav87> as in - the tick doesn't appear in the checkbox?
[10:03:37] <gotwig> keirlav87: if the checkbox is checked, (psuedo state) properties should be set
[10:03:49] <gotwig> keirlav87: yeah it doesnt appear
[10:03:59] <gotwig> keirlav87: that "open menu" thing is binded to the checkbox.
[10:04:28] <veQue> if i wanted to swipeleft a number to delete it and i wanted to animated it moving to the left what would i do... I have an answer but looking for a better one
[10:04:37] <veQue> inside an input
[10:04:56] <gotwig> hm
[10:04:59] <gotwig> I actually fixed it
[10:05:03] <gotwig> but the menu does still not react.
[10:05:14] <gotwig> now it says "close menu"
[10:05:16] <johnny_|_> Hi. What is the "correct" approach of selecting first row of first column in the table? Is $('table').find('td').first() ok?
[10:06:06] <gotwig> I guess that is due a not excellent implementation of the parent selector.
[10:06:49] <gotwig> I do it with another way
[10:07:18] <scar> Anyone have an idea why my facebook like button is hidden on firefox and IE but not chrome? it appears style="width:0px;height:0px;" is added to the span and iframe inside fb-like, but on chrome the widths and heights are correct
[10:08:10] <BillCriswell> scar: You logged in with all those browsers?
[10:09:00] <scar> BillCriswell, no but it shows up on chrome when logged out
[10:09:13] <limpc> hi, i have draggable elements which i'm dragging to a sortable container.  im running into problems with it.  In the sortable container I'm using receive: function() to build a strip of images based on information from the dragged image.
[10:09:13] <scar> BillCriswell, i take that back
[10:09:23] <scar> BillCriswell, when im logged out it doesnt appear... hmm is there aw ay to fix that?
[10:09:28] <limpc> however i need the dragged image 'destroyed' so it doesnt drop onto the sortable container. how do i do that?
[10:09:29] * veQue just learned about .each() man do i feel dumb. this will make writing functions Waay easier
[10:09:40] <BillCriswell> scar: I have no idea ot be honest.
[10:09:44] <scar> lol
[10:09:46] <scar> thats whack.
[10:09:47] <scar> :\
[10:09:59] <scar> at least i have something to dig further in ;)
[10:10:59] <BillCriswell> Haha
[10:13:42] <veQue> i got some telephone directories the other day ... so happy to finally have some more monitor stands
[10:15:02] <limpc> how do i stop the original object from being dropped into a sortable container?
[10:16:56] <djQuery> limpc, don't allow it to accept its own items
[10:17:17] <limpc> its from another container, a draggable
[10:18:01] <limpc> however the image is just a placeholder.. I build a different object out of info from the dropped item.  but I need to stop the original item from appearing on the list
[10:18:24] <limpc> right now im getting both
[10:18:40] <limpc> I'm building this out of the receive:() event
[10:18:53] <djQuery> limpc, return false in the recieve?
[10:19:14] <limpc> tried that. still appears
[10:19:36] <djQuery> ?demo

[10:38:01] <brentwalther1> Is there a way to get the previously selected value of a dropdown box? Like "$("#ddlViewBy").val()" but for the old value
[10:38:13] <imsky> no
[10:38:19] <brentwalther1> darn
[10:46:32] <BillCriswell> brentwalther: If you keep a stack of values every time the select is changed you could.
[10:47:05] <slash_nick> Which event triggers when, say, a password field is remembered and filled in by browser?
[10:47:45] <brentwalther> BillCriswell: so you suggest just keeping a local variable with the last selected value?
[10:48:22] <brentwalther> BillCriswell: I have a script that insert a new dropdown if one is used, but if the dropdown is modified instead of used, a new one gets inserted.
[10:48:46] <slash_nick> looks like this (http://stackoverflow.com/a/4938324/1152759) may be what i'm after
[10:49:05] <brentwalther> BillCriswell: Thus, I would like to compare the old value and only insert a new drop down if the previous value was index 0
[10:49:48] <BillCriswell> That sounds good I think.
[10:50:52] <snoyes> How do I select a div with a known class that contains somewhere a particular link? Something like, $('div.knownClass').children('a[href="knownText"]'), but a) children() doesn't work since it's at an unknown depth, and b) I want the outer div, not the link.
[10:51:23] <jiko> .parents
[10:51:52] <jiko> or .find
[10:52:16] <BillCriswell> snoyes: .filter() as well.
[10:53:20] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').filter(function(){ return !!$(this).find('a[href="http://www.google.com"]').length; }).addClass('hasLinkJawn');
[10:53:29] <s34n> I've just run into the strange matter of a <style> element having height
[10:53:47] <s34n> or at least, jquery reports an outerHeight for the tag
[10:53:55] <jiko> what's the !! for?
[10:54:05] <s34n> even though it doesn't take any spce on the display
[10:54:15] <chilversc> jiko: makes a value an actual boolean true/false instead of truthy/falsy
[10:54:39] <jiko> ooooo that's useful
[10:55:20] <chilversc> jiko: right, ! means not, so the first !expr forces it to be boolean, but negates it, so the second ! negates it again
[10:55:59] <chilversc> I wonder if the javascript VMs just treat !! as a cast to boolean operator
[10:56:21] <jiko> that's what it looks like
[10:56:59] <chilversc> jiko: I mean as in rather than executing not(not(expr)) wondering if they just make that the equivilent of (bool)expr
[10:57:29] <snoyes> thanks BillCriswell, seems to work
[10:57:49] <rmill> ?js> print(!!Object)
[10:57:51] <BillCriswell> You don't need the !! here actually.
[10:57:51] <b-ot> rmill: true
[10:57:57] <rmill> ?js> print(!Object)
[10:57:59] <b-ot> rmill: false
[10:58:02] <BillCriswell> Not sure why i used it. Oh well.
[10:58:11] <BillCriswell> snoyes: http://jsbin.com/abuhiq/1/edit wooo
[10:58:12] <jiko> you used it so i could wonder what it was :P
[10:59:25] <snoyes> BillCriswell: what's the reason for the .length? just to return some non-0 value for those which match?
[10:59:34] <BillCriswell> snoyes: Yes.
[10:59:40] <BillCriswell> Actually.. I just learned an easier way.
[10:59:46] <BillCriswell> $('div').has('a[href="http://www.google.com"]').addClass('hasGoogleLink');
[11:00:03] <BillCriswell> puts the "hasGoogleLInk" class on the divs that have it.
[11:00:30] <snoyes> even better
[11:01:01] <BillCriswell> I agree.
[11:01:26] <snoyes> and just like that, those annoying "sponsored" ads in facebook are gone, with $('div.storyContent').has('a[href="/about/ads"]').remove()
[11:02:07] <jiko> can you make that annoying facebook gone? :P
[11:02:45] <jiko> *facebook.com 127.0.0.1
[11:02:54] <snoyes> Ctrl-W, or Alt-F4 works too
[11:02:59] <Dieterbe> dcherman: 10:35:54 < dcherman2> Dieterbe: var requests = $.map( urls, function( url ) { return $.ajax( url ) });  $.when.apply( $, requests ); <-- i got this working. except the callback given to when.done now receives a variable number of arguments
[11:03:06] <jiko> alt+f4 works for everything
[11:03:17] <jiko> how do i save my email to draft in gmail? alt+f4
[11:04:07] <limpc> djQuery:  http://jsfiddle.net/ekXqW/

[11:09:54] <s34n> is there some obvious reason jsfiddle won't let me save a fiddle?
[11:10:11] <s34n> do you need an actual account now for jsfiddle?
[11:10:40] <rmill> s34n: No, sometimes it glitches out.
[11:11:09] <scar> is there a way to get jquery "click" element to not fire when a transparant pixel is selected?
[11:11:16] <rmill> s34n: if you're having issues, give codepen.io a shot.
[11:12:06] <jiko> how do you identify 'transparent pixel'?
[11:12:22] <BillCriswell> scar: You could check the events target.
[11:12:32] <BillCriswell> I want a beer.
[11:12:49] <rmill> ask, and ye shall recieve.
[11:13:02] <limpc> djQuery: you see my comment?
[11:13:03] * rmill gives beer to BillCriswell
[11:13:09] <BillCriswell> That was easy.
[11:13:31] <b-ot> Now I want one too :'(
[11:13:39] <djQuery> limpc, so just remove the item
[11:13:40] <rmill> Go home b-ot, you're drunk!
[11:13:41] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[11:13:41] <BillCriswell> Ohhhh, he's a drinker.
[11:13:48] <jiko> lol
[11:13:50] <limpc> djQuery: how? thats what ive been asking
[11:13:53] <masentinel900> this line is ok?
[11:13:53] <rmill> b-ot: Are you a drunkard?
[11:13:53] <masentinel900> a.attr('background-color', 'yellow')
[11:13:54] <b-ot> rmill: as I see it, yes.
[11:14:01] <rmill> Of course you are.

[11:14:19] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: Yes. Depending what a is.
[11:14:20] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: and add/remove styles instead.
[11:14:22] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhh
[11:14:26] <s34n> rmill: codepen doesn't seem to work at all
[11:14:34] <rmill> codepen.io?
[11:14:39] <BillCriswell> I didn't catch that at all NoiseEee.
[11:14:39] <rmill> Ya it does.
[11:14:50] <s34n> rmill: not for me
[11:14:56] <BillCriswell> .attr('backgroundcolor', 'red')
[11:15:03] <s34n> rmill: I clicked on New Pen
[11:15:07] <BillCriswell> Mixing jQuery with HTML3.2.
[11:15:22] <s34n> rmill: but the screen there has no place to type in any text
[11:15:31] <rmill> WAT
[11:15:35] <rmill> There's 3 panes
[11:15:39] <rmill> HTML/CSS/JS
[11:15:42] <rmill> all editable.
[11:15:42] <scar> jiko, no idea :P
[11:15:56] <BillCriswell> jsbin.com is like that as well.
[11:16:04] <masentinel900> Thanks guys!!
[11:16:06] <jiko> scar: you can't lol
[11:16:07] <djQuery> limpc, http://jsfiddle.net/ekXqW/1/
[11:16:07] <BillCriswell> I learned about that during an interview.
[11:16:08] <masentinel900> Works perfect..
[11:16:24] <jiko> it'd have to be a transparent something. like background: transparent or transparent.jpg
[11:16:25] <s34n> rmill: for me there are three things I would describe as headings. I'm guessing the panels are supposed to be beneath the headings
[11:16:48] <scar> ;)
[11:17:09] <rmill> s34n: Maybe jsfiddle wouldn't save because you have JavaScripts disabled? :)~
[11:17:11] <masentinel900> Guys!!, A last question.
[11:17:31] <masentinel900> I going to give you an example for may understand it better
[11:17:36] <jiko> omg the only person ever to disable javascript O__O
[11:17:59] <s34n> rmill: :) javascript is enabled. the js in the fiddle works. just get 403 errors when I try to save
[11:18:06] <limpc> ah, .helper.. thanks
[11:18:18] <masentinel900> I have four buttons, there are <a> tags which has corresponding href target,
[11:19:02] <masentinel900> each one will open a diferent page, I need to know in the page open, which button open it
[11:19:17] <masentinel900> Some like document.referrer
[11:19:29] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: somePage.url?referredBy=someButton
[11:19:30] <jiko> better to append a query
[11:19:31] <BillCriswell> scar: http://jsbin.com/asogin/1/edit
[11:19:32] <newtonianb> what's the difference between funciton parameters with default values versus default options when you are writing a jquery plugin  http://starter.pixelgraphics.us/
[11:19:47] <s34n> rmill: codepen gives two SecurityErrors
[11:20:04] <limpc> well no that didnt do anything actually
[11:20:08] <rmill> s34n: What browser are you using??
[11:20:09] <limpc> you're just removing the element after drop
[11:20:16] <rmill> I dunno, that sounds weird.
[11:20:20] <limpc> djQuery: that seems like a hack to me
[11:22:20] <djQuery> limpc, yes it does
[11:22:42] <djQuery> limpc, but look around as I fixed enough of the other code to where it should even out
[11:22:47] <limpc> so are you saying theres no way to natively cancel the drop event on the original?
[11:22:48] <masentinel900> NoiseEee: But are there some like a simple function where I can get the id for example of the button which call the new page?
[11:22:52] <manybubbles> hey jquery - I'm looking at http://api.jquery.com/submit/ and I don't see anything that tells me what 'this' is in the event handler.  is this something that'd be super intuitive if I was a javascript ninja?
[11:23:11] <djQuery> limpc, no just how long have you been working in it?
[11:23:26] <limpc> since yesterday
[11:23:57] <newtonianb> which should i use to write default jquery plugin parameters ? http://oi46.tinypic.com/15x1hjr.jpg
[11:24:00] <djQuery> limpc, seems like hack time
[11:25:09] <s34n> can somone please explain the second alert from this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Fx7A6/1/
[11:25:21] <s34n> rmill: firefox
[11:25:51] <BillCriswell> s34n: The outerheight on the p?
[11:27:07] <s34n> BillCriswell: it shouldn't be on the p
[11:27:26] <s34n> it should be on the sibling of the p
[11:27:27] <dcherman> Dieterbe: no idea if you got answered, but for each request you're receiving an array of 3 items as your arguments but you only want the first item in each ( the result ), right?
[11:27:28] <djQuery> BillCriswell, it is giving the outerhieght of the siblings
[11:28:00] <BillCriswell> I believe it's ignoring the <style> tag.
[11:28:03] <djQuery> s34n, well I think it is applying a default of display block to unkown items but not actualy displaying them
[11:28:32] <djQuery> s34n, http://jsfiddle.net/Fx7A6/2/
[11:28:53] <BillCriswell> Duh. Nevermind.
[11:29:51] <tcstar> so i have $("document").on('click','.ajaxLink', function(e) { in my JS and I have a link with the class of ajaxLink -- and it's being caught...  should note the link is loaded via AJAX itself...   though it's also not working on non-ajax loaded stuff either.
[11:30:47] <BillCriswell> tcstar: No quotes.
[11:31:00] <djQuery> tcstar, around document that is
[11:31:19] <sunbeam> how can i best make a google maps link that should be opened in a new tab when i have the full address
[11:31:20] <BillCriswell> Well if you wanna get specific and all! Who needs to do that when they're programming. Psh.
[11:31:24] <djQuery> tcstar, document should be treated as an object not a string
[11:31:59] <tcstar> oh yeah that's right let me try that...
[11:32:07] <Dieterbe> dcherman: yeah, although actually i think i found a better way.. for each individual ajax request i have a success callback that merges the data in a shared object; the done callback of the when then doesn't need to worry about this and can basically ignore all its arguments
[11:32:09] <djQuery> sunbeam, the same way you would any other link
[11:32:23] <Dieterbe> dcherman: does that make sense?
[11:32:28] <djQuery> ?g href target
[11:32:29] <b-ot> djQuery: HTML a target Attribute â†’ http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp
[11:32:59] <djQuery> sunbeam, ^^^
[11:33:00] <sunbeam> djQuery: like how
[11:33:11] <sunbeam> http://maps.google.com/5th avenue, new york
[11:33:12] <sunbeam> like this?
[11:33:20] <dcherman> Dieterbe: that works fine.  either that or you could do $.map( urls, function( url ) { return $.ajax( url ).pipe(function( arg1 ) { return arg1; }; });
[11:33:20] <sunbeam> i mean, i like to know how i put the address
[11:35:37] <Dieterbe> dcherman: that seems a bit more complicated; but thanks for your help
[11:41:34] <s34n> djQuery: why does it show 0 in the first alert, but 19 in the second?
[11:41:45] <s34n> djQuery: I don't get that
[11:42:38] <djQuery> s34n, because that is the computed hieght of those items.
[11:43:34] <s34n> djQuery: aren't both alerts report the height of the same item?
[11:44:07] <djQuery> s34n, no the 2nd allert was displaying the hieght of the style
[11:44:44] <djQuery> s34n, its just a browser quirk that the it has a height at all even though it is not displayed
[11:45:38] <djQuery> s34n, hmmm opened it again and looked at it
[11:45:41] <s34n> djQuery: they should both be displaying the height of the same <style> element
[11:52:26] <Gho5t> is there a way to hook into an iframe's load event when setting its src via js
[11:53:24] <djQuery> s34n, looks like you might have found a bug
[11:53:46] <FernandoBasso> How do I the 'evt' paramenter in an $('myElement').submit(myFunction)); ?
[11:54:16] <FernandoBasso> I pass*
[11:54:31] <djQuery> FernandoBasso, .submit(function(evt){ myFunction(evt); });
[11:54:32] <systemfault> FernandoBasso: It's passed automagically...
[11:54:55] <systemfault> Just add an evt param to myFunction
[11:55:38] <FernandoBasso> Okay, so I still have to use the anonymous function.
[11:56:19] <FernandoBasso> Thanks.
[11:56:41] <djQuery> FernandoBasso, not neccessarily read system faults messages
[11:57:34] <systemfault> You can do: function myFunction(evt) { doWhatever(); }   $('myElement').submit(myFunction);
[11:57:57] <pachet> bonus points if you use .on instead of the convenience wrappers though
[11:58:15] <systemfault> True.
[11:58:36] <djQuery> pachet, .submit now calls on?
[11:59:03] <systemfault> djQuery: He means, $('myElement').on('submit', myFunction);
[11:59:25] <djQuery> pachet, I thought with on you couldn't do stuff like   e.stopPropagation()
[11:59:31] <pachet> er
[11:59:33] <pachet> no
[11:59:38] <pachet> that would suck :[
[12:00:07] <djQuery> does that only apply when you do   $('parentselector').on('click', 'filterselector' , fun
[12:00:35] <djQuery> in that case the click has allready bubled up to the parentselector correct
[12:00:37] <garbagecollectio> setTimeout($(document).trigger('contactcreated', ['23', '/addressbook'], 3000);
[12:00:44] <garbagecollectio> how come that doesn't work
[12:00:55] <pachet> djQuery: yeah, but you can stop it there
[12:01:01] <pachet> so i guess the answer is 'kind of'
[12:01:17] <systemfault> garbagecollectio: Because the first argument to setTimeout is a function.
[12:01:28] <garbagecollectio> it can't be that
[12:01:34] <garbagecollectio> that is like a function
[12:01:34] <garbagecollectio> though
[12:01:39] <garbagecollectio> i mean it is a function
[12:01:45] <pachet> garbagecollectio: setTimeout(function(){$(document).trigger('foo', args); }, 3000)
[12:01:49] <systemfault> Nope, it's a function call.
[12:02:03] <garbagecollectio> its not a function call though
[12:02:12] <garbagecollectio> i mean it is calling a function
[12:02:18] <djQuery> pachet, but $('actualselector').on('click', function(e){ e.stopPropogation();}); should work correct });
[12:02:28] <pachet> djQuery: yeah
[12:02:39] <djQuery> pachet, that is the only reason I have still been using .click and .submit
[12:02:55] <pachet> djQuery: .click, .submit et al all use .on() internally
[12:02:56] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah, it does.
[12:03:24] <djQuery> pachet, systemfault, damit, need to read docs better when patch
[12:03:41] <masentinel900> Someone here have idea how to get the Id in the view of the before onlclick button!!
[12:04:57] <djQuery> masentinel900, before onclick????   you mean mouseover?
[12:05:00] <pachet> view? before onclick button?
[12:05:05] <pachet> yeah, some clarity there
[12:09:32] <garbagecollectio> this doesn't work either
[12:09:33] <garbagecollectio>  //setTimeout(function() { $(document).trigger('contactcreated', ['<%= @contact.id %>', '<%= @redirect_to_destination %>'] }, 3000);
[12:09:37] <garbagecollectio> without the commenting
[12:09:55] <garbagecollectio> setTimeout(function() { $(document).trigger('contactcreated', ['<%= @contact.id %>', '<%= @redirect_to_destination %>'] }, 3000);
[12:10:08] <systemfault> If you have typosâ€¦ of course it won't work..
[12:10:22] <systemfault> Where do you close your .trigger functionÃ‰
[12:10:22] <garbagecollectio> whats the typo
[12:10:24] <systemfault> ?
[12:11:24] <tdignan> missing closing parens for .trigger. perhaps also missing function() {}
[12:12:17] <whatthepoop> stupid question: how do I avoid the repeating the 2nd selection in the following example: $('ul#sections').css('min-height', $('ul#sections').outerHeight()+'px');?
[12:12:30] <masentinel900> <djQuery>: Are you there?
[12:12:35] <djQuery> nope
[12:12:36] <pachet> setTimeout($.fn.trigger.bind($(document), args), 3000)
[12:12:46] <systemfault> whatthepoop: You need a variable.
[12:12:48] <whatthepoop> is the only way to replace the value with an anonymous function that returns the same value using $(this)?
[12:13:05] <pachet> wat
[12:13:27] <pachet> var sections = $('#sections'); sections.css('min-height', sections.outerHeight())
[12:13:28] <systemfault> whatthepoop: var mySection = $('#sections'); mySection.css('â€¦.',mySection.whatever)
[12:14:03] <djQuery> masentinel900, what
[12:14:04] <whatthepoop> systemfault: ah, duh, that works too... I was thinking something like this, which also works: $('ul#sections').css('min-height', function() { return $(this).outerHeight()+'px'; });
[12:14:18] <pachet> dont do that :[
[12:14:34] <djQuery> whatthepoop, you are still casting it to a jquery object twice
[12:14:49] <systemfault> whatthepoop: Alsoâ€¦ unrelated butâ€¦ don't overspecify your selectors
[12:14:51] <whatthepoop> ah, yes, you're correct.. double duh
[12:14:52] <pachet> if your goal is to avoid unnecessary functions, adding another one kind of works against you
[12:15:14] <systemfault> whatthepoop: Specifying ul#section is slower than just #section and has no advantage.
[12:16:16] <whatthepoop> cool, thanks all.. I told ya it was a stupid question! :) I didn't even consider caching the jquery object
[12:18:04] <tubbo> whatthepoop: best name on IRC
[12:18:07] <tubbo> hands down
[12:18:21] <whatthepoop> tubbo: aww, you're too kind. hah thanks
[12:18:34] <masentinel900> See, for example I have four <a> tags, each one with diferents href targets. If I open some page I need to view in that page what button I onclick for may open it?
[12:18:48] <whatthepoop> unfortunately, someone (not me) registered the .com domain very shortly after I'd originally registered this name on reddit as well.. poop.
[12:20:18] <tdignan> get a hipster domain instead
[12:20:20] <tdignan> wtp.io
[12:20:30] <tdignan> you know what it stands for
[12:20:54] <whatthepoop> even hipsterer: w.tp
[12:21:23] * djQuery damn hipsters
[12:23:02] <pachet> you could do
[12:23:09] <pachet> whatthepoo.ps
[12:23:23] <pachet> or better (thank you paraguay)
[12:23:27] <pachet> whatthepoo.py
[12:25:57] <whatthepoop> pachet: omg omg
[12:37:13] <masentinel900> <djQuery>: you understand me explanation?
[12:37:46] <systemfault> Communication issuesâ€¦ I can feel.
[12:40:30] <gotwig> how can I select a parent div by a pressed button
[12:40:34] <djQuery> masentinel900, no
[12:40:40] <Martin-I-DE-NRW> Hi there. I just started using django which is using jquery. In one template I found the following code and I hope someone can explain it to me ... http://dpaste.org/hD7bk/

[12:41:16] <neataroni> i am using jquerymobile-router
[12:41:32] <djQuery> why is pagebeforeshow not firing here ? http://jsbin.com/uwotuy/11/edit
[12:41:37] <djQuery> dang jqm
[12:42:03] <Dieterbe> 2/wc
[12:42:06] <Dieterbe> oops sorry
[12:43:30] <axebox> How come my $.Callbacks are executing when they are parsed? I only need them to execute when they are $.Callback.fire()
[12:44:04] <masentinel900> I need to get some var like id of tag which open a new window with href target?
[12:44:16] <masentinel900> Someoone can help me?
[12:45:02] <bmercer> hello all
[12:45:11] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: I think I understand? Do you want $('a[target=_blank]') ?
[12:45:20] <bmercer> I'm querying some json and curious if there are samples on how to unmarshal it?
[12:45:46] <djQuery> masentinel900, $('a[target=_blank][id]');
[12:45:50] <BillCriswell> Is there another word for unmarshal?
[12:46:07] <bmercer> BillCriswell: is it easier if I show you my code and json?
[12:46:18] <BillCriswell> bmercer: Could be.
[12:46:30] <djQuery> so does pagebeforeshow not fire for the first page in jquery mobile?
[12:47:09] <gotwig> how can I get the second level parent of something, where I have to use *this*
[12:47:11] <gotwig> selector pls
[12:47:33] <pachet> $(this).parent().parent()?
[12:47:35] <masentinel900> For example I press the button with id "something", which have href="new_page", Now in the new page when open I need to show the id="something" which allow me open the page
[12:47:38] <gotwig> like the first parent , not sibling, that contains *this*
[12:47:43] <djQuery> gotwig, $(this).parent().parent()
[12:47:49] <bmercer> BillCriswell: http://play.golang.org/p/vsQH7-yWDJ
[12:47:49] <gotwig> oh
[12:47:53] <gotwig> only concatanating
[12:48:07] <bmercer> and I'm seeing 1[object Object] in my page
[12:48:12] <bmercer> which is almost what I'm after :)
[12:48:13] <pachet> i think chaining is the accepted term
[12:48:25] <djQuery> masentinel900, not gonna happen without passing parameters to the other page
[12:48:28] <axebox> How come my $.Callbacks are executing when they are parsed? I only need them to execute when they are $.Callback.fire()
[12:48:50] <djQuery> axebox, how are you defining them?
[12:49:13] <djQuery> axebox, you not leaving the () on them are you
[12:49:16] <systemfault> Anyone using .parent() more than once should be lashed twice.
[12:49:30] <pachet> masentinel9000: <a href="new_page?target=foo">
[12:49:32] <gotwig> djQuery: thankx, DJ
[12:49:42] <dougb_> i'm using .on for mouseenter and mouseleave and it works fine for elements that load on page load, but not for ajax elements...how can I make it work for elements that load via ajax?
[12:49:47] <BillCriswell> bmercer: I think you just want field.name
[12:49:52] <djQuery> systemfault, agreed at that point I usualy use .closest or parents(somesleector)
[12:50:07] <chilversc> dougb_: you probably want a live handler
[12:50:16] <axebox> djQuery I am using $.Callbacks.add(func1,func2,func3);
[12:50:20] <bmercer> BillCriswell: ok, will try :)
[12:50:30] <dougb_> chilversc: live is depreceated
[12:50:35] <axebox> djQuery I am not using $.Callbacks.add(func1(),func2())
[12:50:40] <bmercer> BillCriswell: duh... thanks!
[12:50:43] <chilversc> dougb_: naw, its syntax just changed, was all unified under .on
[12:50:46] * systemfault hugs djQuery 
[12:50:58] <BillCriswell> bmercer: No problem!
[12:51:10] * djQuery wishes for lashes instead
[12:51:13] <pachet> systemfault: whats wrong with calling it multiple times
[12:51:19] <dougb_> chilversc: i am using .on currently, but it's $('.hover').on({ mouseenter:..., mouseleave: ...});
[12:51:27] <pachet> hell, its probably faster than passing a selector to .closest()
[12:51:30] <chilversc> I guess delegated is the new term
[12:51:53] <chilversc> dougb_: that doesn't create a delegate (live) event handler, that attaches to the events that currently exist
[12:52:17] <dougb_> chilversc: i tried $(window).on('.hover', {mouseenter:..., mouseleave:...}); but it didn't seem to work
[12:52:21] <chilversc> hmm, and mouseenter/exit are not events you really want to be making a live event handler for
[12:52:36] <systemfault> pachet: slow and brittleâ€¦
[12:53:07] <chilversc> dougb_: the syntax would be $(target).on({mouseenter: .., mouseleave: ..}, '.hover')
[12:53:26] <chilversc> dougb_: but mouse enter/leave happens often, so you don't really want to be bubbling that up to window all the time :s
[12:53:35] <pachet> systemfault: maps directly to .parentNode
[12:53:50] <pachet> everything else goes through $.dir
[12:53:51] <chilversc> I wonder if you can listen out for DOM changes, and add an event handler when you detect a dom change
[12:53:55] <systemfault> pachet: Still a useless function call..
[12:54:24] <djQuery>  why is pagebeforeshow not firing here ? http://jsbin.com/uwotuy/11/edit     does pagebeforeshow not fire for the 1st page in jqm
[12:55:42] <pachet> systemfault: in the case that, for whatever odd reason, you find yourself needing a ref to parentNode.parentNode, what do you do?
[12:56:22] <systemfault> pachet: I use .closest with a proper selector
[12:56:47] <systemfault> pachet: Makes the code less brittle because you can add elements between and the JS will still works.
[12:57:31] <dougb_> chilversc: awesome, thank you! i got it working.  I attached it to the parent container so it's not looking at window constantly :)
[13:01:25] <pachet> systemfault : im more likely to break the selector than i am to alter the nodetree :[
[13:02:02] <djQuery> pachet, systemfault, http://jsperf.com/closest-vs-parent-parent
[13:02:51] <djQuery> pachet, systemfault, even though parent().parent() is faster I still before doing .closest so I can specify what I am looking for incase the page changes
[13:03:17] <neataroni> is there a way to stop jquery for stripping query parameters from url? why would it do this to begin with???
[13:03:23] <neataroni> jquery mobile sorry
[13:03:45] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah, makes your code less brittleâ€¦ like I said.
[13:05:26] <djQuery> systemfault, seems like I might switch to parents('li') though
[13:05:35] <djQuery> its a little faster and has the same benifit
[13:07:16] <systemfault> djQuery: I agree that .parents seems better in most cases, thanks for showing me that function
[13:08:27] <gotwig> djQuery: hey, Dj
[13:08:40] <gotwig> djQuery: how can I use this to get another tag in the same context?
[13:08:46] <pachet> its only faster because whatever structure you're testing it on isn't deep enough to outweigh the cost of checking at every level of the tree
[13:09:12] <gotwig> like, I want the p tag, that is in the same div as the one that has the content for *this*
[13:09:21] <gotwig> get sibling?
[13:09:29] <pachet> once you get enough nesting going on, $.fn.closest will outperform because it'll break on the first matching result and save you from having to iterate all the way to the root
[13:10:24] <pachet> gotwig: foo.siblings('p')
[13:10:32] <djQuery> pachet, parents? wont do thr same?
[13:10:48] <gotwig> pachet: its in the same div, right?
[13:10:54] <gotwig> so these tags are siblings to each other?
[13:11:15] <pachet> if your constraint is you have to use the 'this' keyword, it would be $(this).siblings('p')
[13:11:48] <gotwig> but I just want one
[13:11:54] <gotwig> so just sibling(); ?
[13:11:59] <pachet> which one :[
[13:12:13] <pachet> $(this).siblings('p:eq(0)')
[13:12:23] <djQuery> gotwig, $(this).next('p')  or prev('p')
[13:12:42] <pachet> oh yeah, or those^
[13:12:50] <djQuery> gotwig, your not realy being clear
[13:12:55] <gotwig> so no .sibling('p') ?
[13:13:10] <pachet> gotwig: djQuery is right, use .next() or .prev()
[13:13:29] <gotwig> but there is only one tag that should match, right..?
[13:13:42] <gotwig> one sibling, with p, not multiple..
[13:14:38] <pachet> next('p') will necessarily return only one element
[13:14:49] <pachet> it maps to .nextSibling, if that property isn't undefined
[13:14:58] <gotwig> hm, but that does not work for me
[13:15:07] <gotwig> I checkout..
[13:15:08] <gnarf> Anyone doing the jQueryTO conf tomorrow?
[13:15:08] <pachet> !paste
[13:15:19] <djQuery> <div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><a></a><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
[13:15:22] <gotwig> no, I do that for my own :X
[13:15:38] <pachet> not sure what that means
[13:15:54] <djQuery> gnarf, you drive me there?
[13:16:38] <pachet> shotty
[13:16:43] <gnarf> djQuery: i don't even own a car...
[13:17:46] <djQuery> gnarf, then stop trying to get me excited
[13:17:49] <gotwig> are you sure that is the right selector :/ ?
[13:17:50] * djQuery damn tease
[13:18:06] <gotwig> or should I use prev, if the thing is before the actual element in the dom?
[13:18:27] <gotwig> is prev and next for going trough the dom or what
[13:18:34] <pachet> yes
[13:18:44] <pachet> they map to .previousSibling and .nextSibling, as you'd expect
[13:19:28] <gnarf> gotwig: prev/next/siblings are like left/right, where closest/parents are up, and find() is down
[13:19:38] <gnarf> usually
[13:19:41] <gnarf> if you are looking for something
[13:19:50] <gnarf> you want to .closest(".container").find("something")
[13:19:53] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Good way to word that.
[13:20:16] <pachet> closest find closest find a b prev next
[13:20:18] <gotwig> so, now it works
[13:20:21] <gotwig> but just with one this
[13:20:25] <lypse> hello
[13:20:26] <gotwig> not with others
[13:20:28] <lypse> does anyone tried to set custom position for each nested submenu in menu() plugin?
[13:21:15] <gnarf> lypse: if anyone has, kborchers would be closest i think
[13:21:31] <Chillance> so, selecting with attribute with [id] and [name] works. so why doesnt "[id][name]" work?
[13:21:34] <gotwig> it only works for a href that is exactly after the one I get
[13:21:38] <gotwig> in the dom
[13:21:39] <gnarf> not sure if he's on IRC atm
[13:22:00] <gotwig> but there are no other p tags here
[13:22:03] <gotwig> damn :(
[13:22:13] <Chillance> oh, wait, it means both has to be there?
[13:22:14] <gotwig> so I can use closest for the whole div?
[13:22:19] <gnarf> gotwig: pro-tip: use classes and semantic markup
[13:22:28] <gnarf> then you wont have to do silly traversal
[13:23:00] <Chillance> if I want to select with any of the attributes mentioned then?
[13:23:03] <gnarf> you can use closest to find the nearest element starting from yourself going upward that matches a selector
[13:23:05] <gnarf> `api closest
[13:23:06] <b-ot> gnarf: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:23:42] <relipse> the US chould change the words "under God" to "in rebellion against God" in the pledge
[13:24:03] <gotwig> relipse: stop that
[13:24:14] <gnarf> lypse: he's probably working on his talk for jQueryTO or something
[13:24:23] <relipse> jqueryto?
[13:24:29] <gnarf> jQuery Toronto
[13:24:42] <gnarf> http://jqueryto.com/
[13:24:47] <pachet> jqueryto the stars
[13:24:53] <djQuery> $('dollars').text().replace.....
[13:24:54] <lypse> oh, okay
[13:25:05] <jiko> ohh that's what the to is for. clever
[13:25:09] <djQuery> trying to figure out how that was relevent
[13:26:22] <gotwig> I cant do that...
[13:27:33] <gotwig> that here is my html : http://paste.ubuntu.com/5577536/  the increaseFont decreaseFont and such have event listeners
[13:27:59] <gotwig> That is my jQuery: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5577538/
[13:31:08] <BillCriswell> Canada, Eh?
[13:31:21] <gotwig> whats wrong here <.>?
[13:33:26] <gotwig> I got it
[13:33:33] <gotwig> I simply used siblings method..
[13:35:32] <lypse> here's the deal - http://jsfiddle.net/3bfuK/
[13:35:51] <lypse> i need to display 3rd level menu on the right of parent element
[13:36:06] <lypse> now every submenu is showing below parent ul
[13:40:38] <djQuery> frigin jqm pagebeforeshow
[13:41:13] <djQuery> if I do something to navigate to a page it works fine
[13:41:32] <djQuery> but if I do $.mobile.changePage  it never fires
[13:43:57] * pachet seems to remember suggesting .siblings() from the outset
[13:44:05] * pachet is also 10 minutes late to respond
[13:47:10] <djQuery> lypse, so you just want the 1st level to appear under neath and all others to appear to the right correct
[13:49:05] <lypse> 1st level horizontaly as it is, second level right below parent (as it is), third level right to the second level
[13:50:03] <lypse> just like it is here http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar
[13:50:29] <lypse> in section "5 - Latest version of plugin:" - second example
[13:50:41] <lypse> on the bottom of the page
[13:57:58] <lypse> i hope You understand what i mean
[14:05:44] <Ronald__> is there anyone here willing to assist me a bit in automating some actions? i'm kinda stuck on something
[14:06:15] <shoky> ?ask
[14:06:15] <b-ot> shoky: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:06:16] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:06:53] <Ronald__> ok, i'll try to describe the situation then :)
[14:08:48] <shoky> or just demonstrate it - http://jsfiddle.net
[14:10:44] <Ronald__> i'm automating a site from which i dont have the source, but now there's something i cannot figure out: there's a searchbox nested in a div. if i fill in the searchbox the results will be generated in more nested divs. i want to detect the moment the divs appear. they have no specific id's. so basically what i want is to detect when my search has results
[14:10:49] <Ronald__> i don't have the source of the site
[14:12:10] <Ronald__> i tried doing stuff like $("theparentdiv").on("change","",function(){console.log('bla');}); but all to no avail
[14:12:32] <gotwig> That is my javascript... http://paste.ubuntu.com/5577645/ I get the error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL  for the first line
[14:13:04] <Ronald__> i also tried the blur event on the parent with the second selector pointing at div children, but no callback :(
[14:13:57] <d3str0y> Hi there, I'm working with a Content Management System and have limited control over my HTML output. I'm using the following javascript function to animate a div on hover over. How would I go about excluding animation on the '.views-row' elements that have the social-sprite divs inside of them http://pastebin.com/nfRJCjXD
[14:14:30] <d3str0y> Basically what im doing is showing employee photos and when you hover over it the div animates up and you cna see their social networking link icons, but not all of the people have social networking links and so when it animates up its blank
[14:14:59] <d3str0y> not really sure what the best way to make it conditional and know which ones are blank through the javascript
[14:14:59] <duanemoody> i realize the concept sounds counterintuitive, but i'm writing a contentscript in chrome which needs to set onclick attrs and jQ seems unwilling to do so
[14:15:13] <duanemoody> $(this).attr("onclick","alert('hi');");
[14:15:18] <gotwig> pls help
[14:15:29] <duanemoody> if i name that attribute anything that isn't an event, it works
[14:15:51] <duanemoody> the page being modified with the contentscript isn't jqueried
[14:16:27] <UserXP> hello everyone
[14:16:48] <UserXP> at jquery effect slide can i put two directions
[14:16:50] <UserXP> ?
[14:17:21] <UserXP> $(this).hide("slide", { direction: "down", "left" }, 1000);
[14:17:42] <UserXP> please some help how can i do that
[14:18:50] <duanemoody> is there a way to force jQuery to pass the attribute name and value in this case?
[14:19:25] <UserXP> not work
[14:20:09] <dsemenov> Hi guys, I'm looking for specific plugin. Basically all demo page of it is just white square button with text and black border, when you click on it - text switches with animation top-to-bottom. Anyone remembers something like this? I visited that page a month ago, but can't find it now.
[14:20:10] <shoky> gotwig: looks like you have a new-line in the middle of a string
[14:26:27] <shoky> duanemoody: works for me. though even if it didn't i wouldn't be surprised
[14:28:06] <duanemoody> interesting
[14:28:08] <shoky> duanemoody: o just realized you're talking about a chrome extension. shrugs. anyway why are you setting onclick attributes?
[14:28:08] <b-ot> shoky: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[14:28:17] <limpc> how do you detect if a drag/drop from a draggable is dropped in an invalid location?
[14:28:27] <limpc> e.g. outside of a droppable container
[14:28:33] <duanemoody> because i'm using jquery as a toolkit to manipulate the elements on a page i don't otherwise control
[14:28:46] <duanemoody> i could in theory embed jquery in the page though
[14:30:15] <shoky> duanemoody: if you want to use something native, use addEventListener
[14:30:21] <shoky> not arcane onclick attributes
[14:30:56] <limpc> does the 'revert' fire an event of some sort?
[14:31:01] <duanemoody> i'll consider it, but i'm still concerned why jQuery's refusing to pass what is still an attribute
[14:31:16] <shoky> er by arcane i mean old :\
[14:31:49] <shoky> duanemoody: the attribute is not set? or its set but the event callback isnt triggereD?
[14:31:57] <duanemoody> it won't set
[14:32:08] <duanemoody> if i rename it to anything else that's not an event, it works
[14:32:30] <duanemoody> either that or chrome's doing it
[14:32:37] <duanemoody> i bet that's it
[14:32:51] <shoky> yeah sounds like a browser behaviour
[14:34:00] <limpc> nm i found an undocumented event api
[14:34:10] <limpc> revert: function(valid) { }
[14:35:57] <jdguzman> hello all â€¦ I have a peculiar thing happening.
[14:36:00] <jdguzman> so I have an element with a binding to its click event. When I click it the binding is lost.
[14:36:16] <jdguzman> I'm on jquery 1.6.4
[14:36:24] <jdguzman> has anyone come across something like this?
[14:40:27] <duanemoody> http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy.html
[14:40:29] <duanemoody> yep
[14:40:48] <d3str0y> hmm
[14:43:15] <jrockjiggz> duanemoody: you would define your policy in your manifest file.  When it comes to google apps, chrome tries to contain it in a 'sand box' that allows as much scripting that makes sense, but does limit some scripting with good reason
[14:43:30] <duanemoody> i know how to handle this
[14:43:37] <duanemoody> thanks
[14:43:41] <jrockjiggz> gl
[14:44:32] <neataroni> is there a way to dim the whole window with jquery?
[14:47:55] <gotwig> is anything wrong with that? if($(this).siblings("p").css('font-weight') === 700)
[14:48:58] <say2joe> $("body").fadeTo(1500,0.5);
[14:52:22] <say2joe> gotwig: doesn't the css property return a string?
[14:52:36] <gotwig> .. I just use a variable now
[14:52:39] <say2joe> you might want to just use == instead of ===
[14:53:16] <gotwig> yes
[14:54:16] <gotwig> say2joe: does not work
[14:54:54] <gotwig> I know that the selector that I have delivers the right dat
[14:54:57] <gotwig> a
[14:55:00] <shoky> ?:eq @ raj
[14:55:01] <bot-t> raj, :eq(index): Select the element at index n within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[14:55:32] <raj> thankyup
[15:05:26] <bakaneko_> test
[15:10:50] <say2joe> gotwig: got a jsfiddle or bin or page to view it?
[15:11:09] <gotwig> say2joe: I already fixed it
[15:11:36] <say2joe> oh sorry. what was the problem anyway?
[16:29:27] <recurse> evening folks. I'm trying to convert, what i think is a prototype ajax call with with jquery equivalent. So far no success. It's a simple couple of lines, perhaps one of you can take a stab at? http://pastebin.com/i9e5ivUf
[16:34:07] <Cronoh> recurse the code you show us shouldnt include php
[16:34:21] <Cronoh> for all i know that is where your problem is
[16:34:31] <Cronoh> show us once its rendered by php
[16:34:43] <recurse> erm...
[16:34:46] <recurse> the php is fine
[16:34:53] <recurse> but ill swap it for what it parses too
[16:35:25] <Cronoh> well i dont see anything complex about what youre doing what part is having trouble then
[16:35:32] <recurse> (ps if the php wasnt parsing properly, id have other issues)
[16:35:46] <recurse>  it simply doesnt work
[16:35:54] <recurse> the ajax function does work
[16:35:58] <recurse> the jquery doesnt.
[16:36:03] <recurse> i suspect it's my syntax
[16:36:11] <Cronoh> so the ajax call never fires off?
[16:38:06] <recurse> http://pastebin.com/A56VbWjc
[16:38:19] <recurse> ok there is the more complete script
[16:38:33] <recurse> i figured you may have needed some scope as to what my id is doing
[16:38:47] <recurse> the old method, using new ajax(blah) worked
[16:38:54] <recurse> Im trying to move away from the old
[16:39:00] <recurse> and retrofit with kquery
[16:39:05] <recurse> jquery**
[16:39:07] <shoky> recurse: some problems there..
[16:39:22] <shoky> function orderLoadComplete(req,id)   but you're calling:   orderLoadComplete(id);
[16:39:26] <shoky> var box = $('view_order_'+id);
[16:39:29] <shoky> box.innerHTML = req.responseText;
[16:39:41] <shoky> jquery objects don't have a .innerHTML property. use .html(...)
[16:39:52] <recurse> ahh
[16:40:06] <shoky> check your console, check your networks tab, etc.
[16:40:27] <recurse> yea im a php / mysql / linux guy ... this js is wracking my peanut atm
[16:40:30] <shoky> and like Cronoh said, don't show us php
[16:40:40] <Cronoh> developer console will do you a world of help
[16:40:46] <Cronoh> should make debugging js very easy
[16:41:00] <tw2113> mmm console
[16:41:00] <recurse> yes i work with it frequently, just js isnt my fortay
[16:41:09] <recurse> i dabble
[16:41:11] <shoky> also..
[16:41:12] <recurse> clearly
[16:41:16] <shoky> you're calling jQuery.noConflict()
[16:41:17] <shoky> and then using $
[16:41:51] <recurse> where do you see the unreplaced $?
[16:41:58] <shoky> var box = $('view_order_'+id);
[16:42:06] <recurse> but thats prior
[16:42:10] <shoky> no its not
[16:42:12] <johnny_|_> recurse: also horrible indent
[16:42:19] <Cronoh> lol
[16:42:21] <recurse> well obviously i have to convert this entire snippet
[16:42:31] <recurse> yea blame that on pastebin!
[16:42:38] <johnny_|_> lol no
[16:42:40] <Cronoh> not rly
[16:42:48] <Cronoh> your success: function() was never indented
[16:42:57] <recurse> itsd always pastebins fault
[16:43:01] <Cronoh> :D
[16:43:04] <recurse> ;)
[16:43:16] <recurse> mysterious innHTML being inserted in my jquery for example
[16:43:24] <Cronoh> lol
[16:43:31] <Cronoh> stupid pastebin editing your code
[16:43:32] <recurse> heh
[16:43:35] <recurse> yes!
[16:43:39] <recurse> its a conspiracy!
[16:43:43] <recurse> =)~
[16:43:51] <recurse> hey fellas, thanks much for the tips
[16:43:56] <recurse> appreciate it, really i do
[16:43:58] <Cronoh> best of luck
[16:44:05] <recurse> going to implement some and return back with results, if any
[16:44:16] <Cronoh> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:44:29] <Cronoh> double check that ofcourse, since i dont see them using success: function() but it will still work
[16:44:47] <shoky> er
[16:44:57] <shoky> don't put 'new' before jQuery.ajax()  :)
[16:44:59] <recurse> thats me throwing shit at the wall at this point
[16:45:14] <recurse> (seeing what sticks)
[16:45:21] <recurse> beat it till it submits kinda thing
[16:45:23] <Cronoh> slippery walls
[16:45:27] <recurse> very!
[16:45:46] <Cronoh> ;p
[16:45:57] <johnny_|_> recurse: and another free one: 1. put alert(â€¦) in front of your orderLoadComplete(..). Replace alert with console.log
[16:46:08] <Cronoh> yes
[16:46:21] <shoky> also.. see ?ftj
[16:46:22] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[16:46:52] <Cronoh> console.log will allow you to throw variables in there and allow you to view them in your console, and alert before your function would ave you from knowing if it succeeded but then you errored inside your function
[16:47:00] <Cronoh> save you *
[16:47:16] <muffinrecon> ping
[16:47:18] <recurse> and why not alert functions with my var dump?
[16:47:19] <muffinrecon> whoops
[16:47:34] <Cronoh> use console.log once
[16:47:36] <Cronoh> and youll be like
[16:47:37] <Cronoh> oooohhh
[16:47:38] <recurse> well no i understand why completely, dumb questino
[16:48:15] <glaksmono> hi everyone
[16:48:22] <Cronoh> 0/
[16:49:07] <glaksmono> so i'm wondering what's messed up here: I have an element called, row, which is a TR, the context of the row for some reason is one of the TD, and when I'm using row as the context, it uses its context TD.. and I can't find the siblings.. ideas how to solve this problem?
[16:49:20] <shoky> ...
[16:49:45] <shoky> "the context of the row is one of the TD"  ?
[16:49:59] <glaksmono> yeah
[16:50:01] <glaksmono> exactly
[16:50:05] <shoky> what do you mean by context
[16:50:05] <glaksmono> that's why i'm so confused lol
[16:50:08] <tw2113> *puts a helmet on shoky to keep his head from splodin*
[16:50:09] <shoky> and.. what do you mean, at all :P
[16:50:14] <shoky> lawl
[16:50:14] <glaksmono> row.context
[16:50:36] <shoky> ?demo @ glaksmono

[16:50:44] <tw2113> it's perferated, so you may get minor leakage
[16:50:59] <shoky> as long as its brain juice
[16:51:22] <tw2113> no one has need for that
[16:51:37] <shoky> it's a luxury
[16:55:21] <sahbeewah> so apparently .map returns a jquery object... is there any way to make it return an array?
[16:55:31] <sahbeewah> trying to use it like a list comprehension
[16:57:41] <sahbeewah> ah, there's a .toArray(), who'da thunk
[17:05:09] <glaksmono> so apparently if you do context('tr')
[17:05:13] <glaksmono> i meant
[17:05:30] <glaksmono> if you do foo.closest('tr'), where foo is the children of tr, the context will be foo
[17:05:40] <glaksmono> is there a way to make the context as the matched element?
[17:06:46] <tw2113> did i miss the jsfiddle for this odd table context?
[17:14:23] <glaksmono> http://api.jquery.com/closest/ <-- basically it's saying that it's going to use jquery context
[17:14:27] <glaksmono> which is the current context
[17:14:32] <glaksmono> not the matched element
[17:14:41] <glaksmono> i want to change the current context to the matched element's context
[17:16:06] <sahbeewah> that doesn't make any sense
[17:16:35] <sahbeewah> the context helps find the element, you can't set the context to the element that hasn't been found yet
[17:37:18] <sunbeam> I have a template that uses <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1" />
[17:37:22] <sunbeam> I DONt want to use this when my site is in tablet / portrait mode
[17:37:23] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do that?
[17:37:25] <sunbeam> when (screen) and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 959px)
[17:39:13] <sunbeam> when (screen) and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 959px) I do NOT want this  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1" />
[17:48:32] <glaksmono> anyone know how to disable TD?
[17:48:42] <glaksmono> the entire TD and its content?
[18:01:15] <rmill> glaksmono: What do you mean disable?
[18:01:35] <rmill> ?api unbind

[18:31:31] <JBlitzen> Hmm
[18:31:46] <JBlitzen> In a drop event, I'm receiving the dropped object as "ui.draggable"
[18:32:09] <JBlitzen> Within that handler, I'd like to change CSS of a child div of that dropped object
[18:32:16] <JBlitzen> But I'm not sure how to select it
[18:32:26] <JBlitzen> This would be a custom handle for resizable
[18:32:46] <JBlitzen> And I want to set its display property from none to inline or something
[18:39:25] <JBlitzen> ooo got it

[18:55:30] <jrockjiggz> IE support is an inconvenience
[18:56:02] <jrockjiggz> but that is life..
[18:56:13] <jrockjiggz> I guess less inconvenience than the previous
[18:57:26] <jrockjiggz> works with IE9 - just without the animations
[18:57:31] <jrockjiggz> IE8 is blocked

[19:45:38] <Ancient> Or is that a question better suited to #jquery-dev
[20:08:20] <zubelgenubi> little problem: when jquery ui datepicker pops up over jquery mobile submit button, the button gets the click and not the datepicker...
[20:08:58] <zubelgenubi> any tips on making the datepicker lay on top of the button?
[20:21:09] <zubelgenubi> here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cpma8/
[20:21:24] <zubelgenubi> the button gets the click, not the datepicker...
[20:35:01] <veQue> i have input fields i want to solely use as outputs. i dont want the user to be able to tab into it, i dont want the user to do anything but see it
[20:35:06] <veQue> how do i do this
[20:35:10] <veQue> i tried disable
[20:35:17] <veQue> but it greyed out everything
[20:35:51] <veQue> i tried	$("selectr).bind('change keydown keyup keypress swipeleft input', function(){ return false;});
[20:36:07] <veQue> but it still allows me to tab into it fom the previous input
[20:38:23] <zubelgenubi> try disabled="disabled" or tabindex="-1"
[20:39:11] <limpc> any idea what would cause a sortable to always drop elements to the bottom of the list?  I'm dragging it from a draggable container, and I see a placeholder in the sortable indicating where I'm dropping it (e.g. mid-list). but when I drop it, it jumps to the bottom
[20:47:36] <zubelgenubi> Any idea how to fix datepicker not getting clicked because a button is behind it? http://jsfiddle.net/cpma8/
[20:50:52] <veQue> thanks tabindex='-1' solves one of the issues
[20:51:05] <veQue> but disabled still greys out the input area
[20:51:19] <veQue> i want it to look the same
[21:11:10] <veQue> how to ignore focus i guess
[21:20:32] <LeoSh> does jquery do something weird with how jquery does css() that would cause it to work out of order?
[21:20:45] <LeoSh> Here's a really strange jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/NaGCR/1/
[21:21:02] <LeoSh> if I uncomment the position line, the console output is incorrect
[21:21:19] <LeoSh> or maybe its the each() ?
[21:30:31] <boytoy> can anybody vouch for https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond for js media queries?
[21:31:09] <boytoy> (im using http://metafizzy.co/blog/beyonce-seamless-fluid-image-masonry/ which does 3 columns by default, but i need to modify the js down to 2 columns for mobile so...)
[21:41:53] <skatr_gurl> I have a jquery sidebar animation that I also want to appy to a div class element, but it's not working out. Can anyone help?
[21:45:11] <Wolfed> does jQuery support :not?
[21:45:27] <greg5green> yes
[21:45:45] <greg5green> http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[21:45:51] <Wolfed> Then I am not reaching this properly :P
[21:46:11] <greg5green> what browser?
[21:46:14] <Wolfed> Thanks, I guess lazyness got to me
[21:46:16] <Wolfed> Chrome
[21:46:30] <greg5green> theres also http://api.jquery.com/not/
[21:47:01] <Wolfed> I have this navigation sidebar links which usually work with preloaded content, however I need to avoid preloaded on this one page
[21:47:03] <greg5green> iirc, 'not-selector' is dependent on your browser, but 'not' is not
[21:47:26] <Wolfed> hum
[21:47:43] <greg5green> but chrome would support the not-selector
[21:47:53] <greg5green> it would only be browsers that dont support css3 selectors, that dont support it
[21:48:27] <Wolfed> neither one worked
[21:48:32] <Wolfed> I might be approaching this the wrong way
[21:50:37] <Wolfed> I have my first div with class 'something', and then like the 12th child is the page menu. I tried adding a .not('.something')
[21:50:52] <Wolfed> but it didnt quiet work, its because the actually clicked function doesnt have the selector?
[21:51:24] <greg5green> can you do up a fiddle real quick?
[21:51:28] <greg5green> or at least paste some code?
[21:52:08] <Wolfed> Lemme give it another try with a few tweaks
[21:52:14] <Wolfed> I'll try to post up something if it doesnt work
[21:52:25] <Wolfed> there we go
[21:52:37] <Wolfed> I just added a class to the links and added the not there
[21:52:38] <Wolfed> :P
[21:52:43] <Wolfed> Thanks though
[21:53:23] <LeoSh> anyone have an idea on my fiddle? seems like js is doing stuff out of order?
[21:53:33] <greg5green> paste again?
[21:53:40] <greg5green> I wasnt signed on when you last sent
[21:54:21] <LeoSh> http://jsfiddle.net/NaGCR/1/
[21:54:44] <LeoSh> if I uncomment the line, the .css() call seems to happen *before* the .position() call
[21:54:47] <LeoSh> which is totally strange
[21:58:35] <greg5green> k
[21:58:38] <greg5green> taking a look now
[21:58:43] <LeoSh> thanks
[21:59:07] <LeoSh> expected console output is 8,28,48,68 and not 8,8,8,8
[22:04:10] <LeoSh> entertaining, no?
[22:07:22] <greg5green> hmm
[22:09:11] <greg5green> Do you want an answer for why it doesn't work? Or for it to work?
[22:09:28] <LeoSh> greg5green: yes to both
[22:10:02] <LeoSh> I'll take any answers you have
[22:10:35] <LeoSh> I have a workaround to just split the two into separate each() loops but I'd really love to understand what's happening here
[22:10:46] <LeoSh> (never mind that it's an ugly workaround)
[22:10:53] <boytoy> My photo gallery at http://home.no/mritz/test/ uses Isotope and Beyonce's technique: http://metafizzy.co/blog/beyonce-seamless-fluid-image-masonry/
[22:10:56] <boytoy> But it's 3 columns, and I need it to be 2 columns for handheld devices, so I need to modify both the CSS and the JS when it drops below 767px.
[22:10:59] <boytoy> At http://home.no/mritz/test/index_jrespond.html I'm trying to use https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond but somehow the photos won't resize properly anymore, can anybody tell what's wrong?
[22:12:24] <greg5green> LeoSh, I'm going to figure this out
[22:12:28] <greg5green> but you gotta give me a minute lol
[22:12:33] <LeoSh> no worries :-)
[22:12:38] <greg5green> I started a new job a few weeks ago building this webapp and we only use dojo
[22:12:40] <LeoSh> it is strange, right?
[22:12:48] <greg5green> I apparently forgot how different it was over the last month
[22:16:01] <LeoSh> greg5green - got it figured out
[22:16:09] <greg5green> share?
[22:16:10] <LeoSh> it's because as you set each element to absolute it's removed from the flow of the page. So the next
[22:16:11] <LeoSh> one is in the same place the first one was when it's loop starts.
[22:16:33] <LeoSh> sort of a DUH moment :-/
[22:16:57] <greg5green> yup
[22:16:59] <greg5green> that would be it
[22:17:21] <LeoSh> I should stop coding and start drinking
[22:17:26] <greg5green> you got me out here comparing element to $(element) to (blah) blah
[22:17:27] <greg5green> lol
[22:17:42] <greg5green> well, ive had a gin and tonic myself, so probably why i didnt recognize
[22:24:03] <boytoy> anybody got a sec?
[22:33:59] <greg5green> boytoy, i have a sec, but I have no interest in looking at your issue, because I can already tell that its not something I want to get into at 1:30am, sorry
[22:38:17] <boytoy> greg5green: np mate :D
[22:39:06] <greg5green> :>
[22:48:00] <veQue> replace(/$/%/,/g, '') should this work?
[22:48:15] <veQue> the % is highlighted a diff color
[22:48:23] <veQue> thinking it's a regex key symbol
[22:48:30] <veQue> dont use it much
[23:37:54] <zubelgenubi> Any idea how to fix datepicker not getting clicked because a button is behind it? http://jsfiddle.net/cpma8/
