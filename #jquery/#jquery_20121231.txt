[00:00:34] <shesek> vaibhavjain, see Deferred pipe() method
[00:01:30] <shesek> you can wrap the promise returned from $.ajax with something that transforms the resolution to something else
[00:02:10] <vaibhavjain> shesek, can you provide some example, i am not so good with Jquery
[00:03:21] <shesek> vaibhavjain, http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/#entry-examples
[00:03:50] <shesek> you probably need to read a bit and understand how deferred objects works first, tho
[00:04:34] <vaibhavjain> shesek: thanks man, i will surely read about it, hopefully it solves my issue :D
[00:04:48] <shesek> what are you trying to do, tho?
[00:07:17] <vaibhavjain> shesek, As soon as an ajax call receives data, it changes the value in a select box, I need to control these options, and modify  some custom data
[00:08:35] <vaibhavjain> shesek, I cannot modify the ajax call, neither the code already written :) ,  so wanted to do this via jquery, Kinda shortcut :)
[00:08:55] <vaibhavjain> Shesek, Lunch time for me, Going AFK
[00:17:19] <bleutyler> I am trying to get a button to disable all checkboxes (works) then enable only 1 (fails) and then submit the form (works) http://jsfiddle.net/nf84Y/
[00:17:42] <bleutyler> I think my problem is that I am trying to use a javascript variable in the jquery selector
[00:22:28] <bleutyler> okay, I fixed my problem by using the id selector
[00:22:37] <bleutyler> please disregard my question
[01:08:00] <slim__> in jQuery Mobile, is there any way to bind a change event to a multiple select menu option, rather than the whole select, so that when i use .val() or .attr('selected') on it I just get that option's attributes, and not a whole array of selected options?
[01:09:41] <slim__> I want to perform an ajax call each time an option is checked and only send that option's data, not the entire select array...
[01:14:04] <ackt1c> try live is checked
[01:14:08] <ackt1c> ?
[01:14:12] <ackt1c> bind change?
[01:15:39] <slim__> $("#myselect").on('change', function(event, ui) {
[01:15:39] <slim__> 		console.log($(this).val());   });
[01:16:55] <ackt1c> $('check').live(function(){$(this).bind('change', function(){ $(this).is('checked', function(){ $.post(...
[01:16:59] <ackt1c> ?
[01:17:02] <ackt1c> like that?
[01:18:03] <ackt1c> just a change is checked, don't really need live
[01:18:18] <ackt1c> unless your rebuilding that check
[01:18:43] <slim__> not exactly. I need to do an ajax call if the option is changed, either checked or unchecked, and just send data about that option, not the whole select element
[01:18:57] <ackt1c> oh
[01:19:11] <slim__> thx tho
[01:20:47] <ackt1c> $('#check').bind('change', function(){ $.post('tofile.php', { 'first': $(this).val(), 'second': $('#second').val() }, function(data){ alert('complete' + data)),'json' )}
[01:21:09] <ackt1c> more like that?
[01:22:27] <slim__> I see what you're getting at, but jQuery Mobile only lets you bind events to the select, not to the option itself: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/selects/events.html
[01:23:14] <slim__> if I try $("#myselect option").on('change', function(event, ui) { ‚Ä¶   it doesn't work
[01:23:30] <ackt1c> yeah
[01:23:54] <ackt1c> the option .is('checked')
[01:24:02] <ackt1c> ?
[01:24:12] <ackt1c> oh use a .click
[01:24:18] <ackt1c> or .bind('click'
[01:24:26] <ackt1c> i think that's what you mean
[01:26:02] <ackt1c> don't know why i thought you were using a checkbox
[01:26:04] <ackt1c> my bad
[01:27:18] <slim__> I'm using a multi select in jquery mobile‚Ä¶ and even binding click to the option doesn't work‚Ä¶ very frustrating
[01:27:57] <ackt1c> i got my multi select to execute onchange="blah blah"
[01:28:03] <ackt1c> haven't moved it to jquery
[01:28:25] <slim__> used query mobile?
[01:29:52] <ackt1c> html
[01:29:59] <ackt1c> plain htm
[01:30:10] <ackt1c> onchange="parent.$('#target').val(this.options[this.selectedIndex].text)"
[01:30:34] <slim__> no, the project is all in query mobile‚Ä¶ that's not really an option. I'm using a multi select like the "choose states" one near the bottom here‚Ä¶ http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/selects/custom.html
[01:31:20] <ackt1c> make sure you're identifying it, if there is no response
[01:50:46] <slim__> solved it. comparing the old array to the new array using an intersection and doing my ajax call for the difference, either added or removed.
[01:59:52] <nilesh786> hi to all
[02:02:08] <nilesh786> 	i have a network printer then how can i print the order receipt on client side using jquery
[02:04:18] <NivenHuH> hey all, i'm using jquerymobile and on a page that i loaded using loadPage() i'm trying to link to different pages (contained by data-page and id's) within the one document that was loaded with loadPage()
[02:04:22] <NivenHuH> but that doesn't seem to work?
[02:08:14] <nilesh786> how can i print the html output on printer using jquery
[02:09:00] <NivenHuH> nilesh786 just call print()
[02:09:04] <NivenHuH> it's built into javascript
[02:10:26] <nilesh786> i have 2-3 network printer
[02:10:44] <nilesh786> the print() is work?
[02:11:05] <nilesh786> this is window print
[02:12:49] <nilesh786> using this function the window popup come out
[02:13:07] <nilesh786> i dont want this window popup
[02:14:38] <nilesh786> like POS printing
[02:19:17] <nilesh786> i have more than one network printer
[02:20:32] <NivenHuH> that's outside of the realm of javascript nilesh786
[02:21:10] <NivenHuH> the print dialogue box that pops up is the gateway to your printer via the browser
[03:48:56] <PY1NB> how can I make thsi work? $(¬¥table td.a OR td.b¬¥)
[03:54:06] <shesek> PY1NB, $(¥table td.a, table td.b¥)
[03:54:45] <PY1NB> hm, ok. actually the selector is much longer, so I would like to option only on the td part.
[03:54:47] <PY1NB> thanks shesek!
[03:54:57] <shesek> PY1NB, or $(¥table td.a').add('table td.b¥)
[03:55:04] <shesek> yeah, that's problematic
[03:55:30] <shesek> you can't do something like $('foo (bar OR baz)') afaik
[03:57:15] <grafi> why would you do or?
[04:38:20] <thomedy> im trying to auto play the video tag with jquery  please help
[04:59:28] <thomedy> how do i clear a value from a text field on focus
[05:01:31] <iNerd> Hello.
[05:01:49] <noregret> thomedy: $(this).val('')
[05:02:02] <thomedy> sorry i have been up for over 30 hours i found it..
[05:05:27] <[ric]> afternoon
[05:06:20] <[ric]> quick question, has anyone implemented the jquery ui accordion effect on a standard DL/DT/DD structure when there are multiple DD elements after the DT header?
[05:07:18] <[ric]> accordion is clearly meant for trigger/content/trigger/content, rather than trigger/content/content/content/trigger/content
[05:08:21] <[ric]> after googling most solutions seem to resort to filling the multiple content into a single DD which isn't the solution I want
[05:08:27] <[ric]> either than or hacking together their own
[05:08:50] <[ric]> I'm just wondering if there is a simple switch that resolves it with DL's
[05:08:58] <[ric]> doesn't seem to be from the UI docs
[05:09:16] <[ric]> this is my last quick check before dropping the idea and moving on
[05:14:18] <abnorm> hey folks. i got a problem when trying to do a post like this: http://pastebin.com/G8DuAPJu .. but something goes wrong, when i check with tamperdata it say that the  method = options , it should be post =s
[05:20:14] <[ric]> abnorm, never used tamperdata but from that code you've pasted I see no problems with the call
[05:22:11] <abnorm> [ric]: ok, tamperdata it just a addon to firefox, exellent tool =) .. uhm =s even more confused now, i suck att this so dont know where to start the debugging
[05:23:41] <[ric]> I use httprequester
[05:23:54] <[ric]> all much of a muchness
[05:24:14] <[ric]> but in terms of the actual pastebin content it's fine
[05:24:43] <[ric]> have you checked what the server is receiving?
[05:24:49] <abnorm> ok, thank you =)
[05:25:44] <abnorm> no, but it was working a while back... and now when i started the project again it's not =/ .. but a guess i have to check the api i do the post to
[05:25:45] <[ric]> and as always if stuck, go create the simplest of test cases in isolation from your current project and see if it operates as you expect
[05:26:14] <[ric]> 99% of the time it's an logic or progmatic error elsewhere
[05:26:24] <abnorm> mhm
[05:27:16] <iNerd> Sigh. I'm here looking for advice after being overwhelmed by google.
[05:28:07] <iNerd> I'm trying to find a slider with thumbnails that supports variable image heights and is open source. Does anyone have any reasonable answers for such a mundane question?
[05:28:45] <[ric]> sorry iNerd, I would do the same as you, hit google
[05:29:10] <iNerd> Just found so many that are almost but not quite entirely like what I'm looking for
[05:29:35] <[ric]> if they are close then just extend a few to match what you need
[05:29:46] <[ric]> that's the best part of JS/jQuery.. :)
[05:30:43] <iNerd> Yeah that's what I'm ultimately thinking I'll have to do
[05:30:51] <Quix0r> "\"" is not a constructor
[05:30:51] <Quix0r> http://localhost/projects/mailer/branches/0.2.1-FINAL/js/jquery.uncompressed.js?dummy=1&ext=sql_patches&ver=0.9.6&rev=6264
[05:30:51] <Quix0r> Line 623
[05:30:59] <Gatito`K> happy new year 2013! :)
[05:31:02] <Quix0r> I'm getting this error, sorry for multiple postings
[05:31:20] <Quix0r> here it is still 02:30pm :)
[05:32:06] <Quix0r> what I need is a backtrace in firebug so I can see where that error comes from
[05:32:09] <[ric]> I am in the UK Quix0r and it aint New Year until GMT says it is.. :)
[05:32:47] <[ric]> btw, your http://localhost/ link isn't going to show shit outside your local pc .. ;)
[05:33:40] <negev> is it possible to manipulate svg text objects with jquery?
[05:33:47] <Quix0r> ;)
[05:33:55] <Quix0r> it is the uncompressed version
[05:33:59] <Quix0r> of jquery
[05:34:20] <Quix0r> http://mxchange.org/js/jquery.uncompressed.js?dummy=1&ext=sql_patches&ver=0.9.6&rev=6264 <-- same file
[05:34:56] <Quix0r> don't mind the parameters, they come from my PHP software
[05:36:10] <[ric]> Quix0r you are getting that error from simply including the js?
[05:36:25] <iNerd> Hmm.
[05:36:52] <Quix0r> I try to "trace" it by inserting alert() windows now
[05:37:14] <[ric]> negev: there i nothing specific in jQ to work with SVG, at least I don't believe so
[05:37:24] <[ric]> however it is part of the DOM so you don't really need there to be
[05:37:35] <[ric]> there might be a plugin, have you checked?
[05:37:55] <[ric]> Quix0r: as I say, is this an error from including the file or when you call it?
[05:38:15] <[ric]> ie: <script src="jquery.js"> or $.doShit();
[05:38:25] <Quix0r> it happens when I throw an exception
[05:39:03] <Quix0r> throw new '"' + prefix + '_' + element + '" does not exist.';
[05:39:45] <[ric]> Quix0r. can't see why jQ would be involved there
[05:39:57] <[ric]> unless prefix or element are jQ objects
[05:40:05] <Quix0r> both strings
[05:40:26] <[ric]> *shrug*
[05:40:35] <[ric]> out of interest have you tried using a different version of jQ
[05:40:43] <[ric]> either revision or unpacked/packed
[05:40:49] <Quix0r> ah
[05:40:57] <[ric]> I still can't see why it would have anything to do with it though
[05:41:09] <Quix0r> this actually causes it: throw new '"' + prefix + '_' + element + '" has no style.display element.';
[05:41:50] <Quix0r> okay, found it :)
[05:42:58] <[ric]> I'd be tempted to wrap that in a.. UserException("xxx");
[05:43:03] <[ric]> but horses for courses
[05:43:26] <Quix0r> and working
[06:00:53] <Quix0r> hmmm, "Guten Rutsch" translates to "Happy new year" which we say before 24:00. but also "Frohes Neues" (what we say at 01/01) translates to "Happy new year"
[06:08:04] <abnorm> [ric]: if u still here.. i found the problem with my post .. i think, the api i try to post to have a url that look like : *api.com/006a4419d6ca1c2a/3053149622fca325  , and thats why i think?
[06:46:27] <happyface> why would $(document).on("scroll", ".class", function()) not trigger but $(".class").scroll(function()) would?
[06:49:17] <pachet> happyface: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/scroll.html
[06:49:17] <pachet> see the row labeled "event bubbling"
[06:50:16] <pachet> happyface: my net just died, did that message go through?
[06:50:20] <pachet> or did someone answer your question
[07:12:41] <belea> hello, how can i set the .val of an input to data from a <td field? is it possible?
[07:13:32] <belea> only thru php ? when i give the info to the <td> also give it to jquery? :-??
[07:15:54] <Tales1> #hi
[07:16:03] <belea> Tales1 if you try www.antivodafone.ro/work/bri.php
[07:16:19] <belea> set the first field and press add , then set Values
[07:16:48] <Tales1> ok... forget php
[07:17:00] <Tales1> we will do this with just jquery for now
[07:17:29] <belea> ok
[07:17:44] <belea> instead of filling with Dolly Duck i need the info from the td ...
[07:18:30] <Tales1> first you need to create a listener to the TR, called click(), so, each TR needs an id on the HTML code <tr id="tr2131"></tr>
[07:19:02] <Tales1> you can do that programatically
[07:19:22] <belea> ok
[07:19:31] <belea> i tried by putting it on td
[07:19:40] <belea> but i actually need entire row values, so perfect
[07:19:48] <Tales1> hmmm wait
[07:20:02] <[ric]> that bri.php page is a really badly formated bit of HTML, I hope it's just a test case as you have no <body> tag and the closing </form> sits between the <tr> and </table>
[07:20:10] <belea> yes
[07:20:13] <belea> testing
[07:20:17] <Tales1> i thought you wanted something like click on a TR and then it will autofill all the values
[07:20:23] <belea> yes
[07:20:30] <belea> that's all i need, so i changed the tr=121
[07:20:34] <belea> tr id=121*
[07:21:15] <Tales1> ok... good now in you jquery... add this:
[07:22:07] <Tales1> $( 'tr[id^="tr"]' ).click( function(){ alert( 'Click' ); } );
[07:22:24] <belea> why id^? i put there 121 ?
[07:22:37] <Tales1> hmmm, no...
[07:22:50] <Tales1> ids should start with letters
[07:23:01] <belea> ok
[07:23:49] <belea> so i add this : $( 'tr[id^="tr"]' ).click( function(){ alert( 'Click' ); } ); after the $(#btn..)
[07:23:57] <Tales1> and that line means... when user clicks a tr which it's id starts with 'tr'... do... alert( 'Click' );
[07:24:07] <Tales1> no...
[07:24:29] <Tales1> after the $( document ). ready( function(){
[07:24:57] <belea> so the tr can directly act as button?
[07:25:00] <Tales1> and add the tr's id tr at the beginning
[07:25:04] <Tales1> yeah
[07:26:16] <belea>     $( 'tr[a121="tr"]' ).click( function(){ alert( 'Click' ); } );
[07:26:27] <Tales1> i see you changed it...
[07:26:41] <Tales1> but the tr's id should start with tr
[07:26:44] <Tales1> not with a
[07:26:48] <belea> oh
[07:28:11] <Tales1> you changed the jquery line
[07:28:21] <Tales1> leave it exactly like it was
[07:28:31] <Tales1> $( 'tr[id^="tr"]' ).click( function(){ alert( 'Click' ); } );
[07:28:37] <belea> hmz
[07:29:05] <belea> cool it works :D
[07:29:17] <Tales1> ok... now we do the job...
[07:29:36] <Tales1> in html5 you can add any attribute to a td element...
[07:30:28] <Tales1> so, you can add for example <td affect="inputName">Blah</td>
[07:30:55] <belea> lets just make it copy the 1st field and i'll read some tutorials on jquery or something to do the rest
[07:31:23] <Tales1> ok... we are going to replace this:
[07:31:48] <Tales1> alert( 'Click' );
[07:31:53] <belea> i thought so :D
[07:32:00] <Tales1> but first...
[07:32:07] <Tales1> change this:
[07:32:56] <Tales1> <tr id="tr121"><td>2131</td> for <tr id="tr121"><td affect="test1">2131</td>
[07:33:18] <belea> ok, i will increment the id
[07:33:43] <belea> oh i see what you mean
[07:33:52] <Tales1> yeah...
[07:33:58] <Tales1> added the affect
[07:34:12] <Tales1> ok, now...
[07:34:22] <Tales1> back to changing the alert
[07:34:55] <Tales1> as you can see we told the td, that it will affect the test1 field
[07:35:00] <belea> ($#test3).val(tr121) ?
[07:35:20] <Tales1> no, lol
[07:35:32] <Tales1> we will do this:
[07:35:51] <Tales1> we need to cycle all the child elements of the TR
[07:37:23] <Tales1> $( this ).find( 'td' ).each { function() { /*CODE WILL GO HERE */ } );
[07:37:37] <Tales1> replace the alert with that
[07:37:43] <belea> this is inside the $(tr id^ stuff ?
[07:37:46] <belea> ok
[07:38:47] <Tales1> and we will tell it... if the td has the affect attribute, do something
[07:41:11] <belea> thanks for helping me btw ... i never had much to do with js and jquery
[07:41:12] <BulleTime> hey guys, anyone knows how to create a loading progress bar like gmail has??
[07:41:26] <BulleTime> can this be done with jquery?
[07:41:29] <Tales1> if( $( this ).attr( 'affect') ){ alert( $( this ).attr( 'affect') ); }
[07:41:47] <Tales1> replace the /* CODE WILL GO HERE */ with that
[07:41:55] <Saaether> BulleTime http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/
[07:42:27] <belea> i did so
[07:42:41] <BulleTime> uuhm yeah but how do i get the percent of load progress?
[07:42:47] <BulleTime> process*
[07:43:10] <belea> no alerts appearing
[07:43:58] <exit2> Any recommendations on a jquery carousel that has thumbnails?
[07:45:22] <Tales1> no... we have a problem with parenthesis... i'm fixing it
[07:46:24] <Tales1> ok... you have an error after the "each"... change { for (
[07:47:03] <belea> it says which fields have affect :D
[07:47:34] <Tales1> ok... now we just set the value
[07:48:49] <Tales1> change again the alert for:
[07:49:14] <Tales1> var affect = $( this ).attr( 'affect');
[07:49:25] <Tales1> then you just do this:
[07:50:48] <Tales1> oh... my mistake...
[07:50:55] <Tales1> i need to get the value first
[07:51:11] <Tales1> try this sorry:
[07:51:39] <belea> no need for sorries, i just thank you so much ... im gonna start learning js and jquery they are nice stuff
[07:52:02] <catcher> join #php
[07:52:03] <Tales1> after the var affect = xxx; type this: alert( $( this ).html();
[07:52:15] <catcher> hrm
[07:52:25] <Tales1> missed a ) at the end, before the ;
[07:53:11] <belea> done
[07:53:39] <belea> it shows the td data that have affect on :D
[07:53:40] <Tales1> good... you see the correct values right?
[07:53:47] <belea> yes
[07:54:26] <Tales1> so, replace the alert for var myval = $( this ).html();
[07:55:22] <Tales1> NOW we can add the values: $( '#' + affect ).val( myval );
[07:55:30] <Tales1> hope this works lol...
[07:55:53] <belea> amazing
[07:55:54] <belea> :D
[07:55:55] <belea> thanks
[07:56:05] <belea> can you recommend some good tutorials on this?
[07:56:30] <BulleTime> is it possible to get the process in percent of a ajax request?
[07:57:07] <belea> Tales1 thank you!
[07:57:15] <Tales1> well... you should use stackoverflow, i usually find my answers over there lol
[07:57:38] <Tales1> the documentation on the official jquery page is good
[07:57:46] <shoky> ?learn
[07:57:47] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[07:58:00] <belea> i tried to look over the examples, i think i was quite superficial tho
[07:58:15] <belea> yep, i guess js first and then ill understand better
[07:58:32] <Tales1> javascript is really easy
[07:59:14] <marcoslhc> And it IS fun :)
[07:59:19] <Tales1> and by the way... you don't need the ; at the end of a sentence if you start next one in a new line... but it looks better
[07:59:41] <belea> ok
[08:00:01] <Tales1> anything else i can help you with?
[08:00:04] <belea> thanks again for help & advice, i really appreciate it. happy new year! brb
[08:09:23] <snollux> Hello! Any idea why 	$("#video1").currentTime = "5000";  doesn't do anything for my HTML5 video?
[08:09:51] <shoky> snollux: you're trying to set a field on a jquery object
[08:10:16] <shoky> snollux: maybe you want $('#video1').prop('currentTime', 5000) or something
[08:17:14] <snollux> weird. shoky, apparently the video just needed to be playing first
[08:17:26] <snollux> so if I do .play() and _then_ the currentTime, it'll work
[08:32:14] <scotdb> jquery validate submitHandler : can you do a non-AJAX POST ?
[08:35:16] <zoned> i've got a page with a lot of dynamic content, when all is said and done i'd like for the user to be able to click a button and generate a pdf of the page. is there any conerns with sending the entire html page as is to my server? or would it be better to simply send some sort of "code" and let the server re-render everything and send that back? the first way would be much easier, but i'm a little concerned with having the serv
[08:35:16] <zoned> execute client side markup that could have been altered
[08:35:51] <ryanneufeld> zoned: there are client side pdf generators
[08:36:12] <ryanneufeld> but sending the entire document back to the server could be costly
[08:36:46] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to use .when() for events? I'd like to have a callback executed when 2 events are triggered, but not until both of them have been triggered
[08:36:55] <zoned> time wise? i'm not too worried about that, but it certainly would be a ton of work to re-render everything, making all the database calls that would be necessary would be just as costly
[08:37:10] <ryanneufeld> timwis: namespaced events, and see on()
[08:37:20] <ryanneufeld> ?on @ timwis
[08:37:20] <bot-t> timwis, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:38:18] <timwis> ryanneufeld, I was actually looking at .on() when you said that. I didn't think you could use that for multiple binds?
[08:38:29] <ryanneufeld> timwis: yesh, you can
[08:39:12] <ryanneufeld> timwis: you can have multiple bindings to the same event, but you can also use namespaced events in jquery
[08:39:24] <zoned> anyone used a JS pdf generator?
[08:39:44] <timwis> ryanneufeld, I know you can attach multiple bindings to the same event, but I'm talking more of conditions for a callback to be executed
[08:40:11] <ryanneufeld> timwis: you can use the event object passed to the callback to get some information
[08:40:39] <timwis> more like $.when(foo.on("awake"), bar.on("awake")).then(do my stuff)
[08:40:49] <ryanneufeld> when doesn't work that way
[08:41:00] <timwis> i know
[08:41:17] <ryanneufeld> so?
[08:42:14] <timwis> in this case, though, the events occur on two different objects
[08:42:31] <ryanneufeld> timwis: you might want to look into pubsub patterns and namespaced eventes
[08:52:35] <misteroneill> timwis: you could create a generic deferred object and update its state in event callbacks - then your functionality which depends on both events having fired can listen to the generic deferred object
[09:02:23] <timwis> Hey, for some reason my callback function isn't being passed through .on() -- myobj.on("reset", this.ifNotWaiting, this.myCallback) -- any idea why? I also tried reversing the order of param2 & 3, no luck
[09:06:45] <AQEEL> hi everyone...
[09:06:58] <ryanneufeld> timwis: see on?
[09:07:00] <AQEEL> how can i make use of data to create a toggle
[09:07:05] <ryanneufeld> timwis: see on
[09:07:07] <misteroneill> timwis: i saw you were asking questions in #documentcloud‚Ä¶ is myobj a jQuery collection or is it a backbone object? because the .on() arguments are different for the two.
[09:07:24] <timwis> misteroneill Ah! That's it, didn't realise that .thanks
[09:07:38] <timwis> was trying everything from the jquery docs lol
[09:07:46] <timwis> wound up just doing an anonymous function
[09:07:53] <misteroneill> ah :)
[09:12:38] <tcstar> okay, so I have a page that will have multiple forms..  some of which will be in ajax, all of which will have unique names...  I need to figure out, how to get the right form to submit, not every form...  any tips on getting started on this? (i was thinking of doing a .live('click', function() {}) on the submit button, not sure if that'll work though.
[09:16:48] <ryanneufeld> tcstar: if each form is it's own <form> then the submit button in that form will submit only that form
[09:17:22] <tcstar> Yes, but i'm doing the submit via ajax...  not a standard submit
[09:17:31] <ryanneufeld> tcstar: that changes nothing
[09:17:58] <ryanneufeld> if you're binding to the submit event on the form
[09:18:27] <ryanneufeld> then this is the form its self
[09:18:51] <tcstar> so using like: $('form').live('submit', function() {}); not a click?
[09:19:14] <ryanneufeld> tcstar: you should use on() instead of live() but yes
[09:19:56] <ryanneufeld> so in the callback, the context is the form, so $(this) would be the same as $('#idofformsubmitted')
[09:20:36] <ryanneufeld> in that you'd have the same element selected
[09:22:14] <tcstar> alright, seems to be working, i
[09:22:24] <tcstar> i'll give it a shot and see how it goes...  thanks...
[09:22:40] <tcstar> btw, i haven't run into .on previously.. whats the diff between that and .live?
[09:22:53] <jrockjiggz> hi, im having js woes.. my content is loading fine, using ich (iCanHaz templating) to insert into $('#holder').html(templateCode); ---- this all WORKS! ^_^ but i'm inconsistantly getting 'broken image'.. as the image will load, then not. or will load on a new cache, but a refresh won't load.. it seems to be a timeout issue, i'm not sure, how can I investigate or debug this? I took a screenshot
[09:22:53] <jrockjiggz> in chrome dev tools of the (failed) image http://i.imgur.com/RTF3e.png ---- i'm just looking for a reason how the browser can fail like this (chrome)
[09:23:54] <Doxin> jrockjiggz: if you go to the console it will most likely show an error for the image, being unable to load it or something of the like.
[09:25:49] <jrockjiggz> Doxin: you are right, but it doesn't prove to provide anything useful.. atleast to me? http://dpaste.org/kHMO2/
[09:27:08] <awc737> I am loading jquery, then jquery.datatables.js, then my .js with $('#example').dataTable();
[09:27:25] <awc737> but I keep getting this in console
[09:27:25] <awc737> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dataTable'
[09:27:59] <jrockjiggz> $.dataTable() <-- does this give error?
[09:28:26] <awc737> Uncaught TypeError: Object function (e,t){return new v.fn.init(e,t,n)} has no method 'dataTable'
[09:29:52] <awc737> here is my <head> , the order looks correct to me
[09:29:53] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/eyE
[09:30:35] <jrockjiggz> awc737: means dataTable() is not an extension of jQuery object.. ie it doesn't exist
[09:31:12] <awc737> it does though, I've included it after jquery.js, same version they use
[09:31:38] <jrockjiggz> awc737: does the script load? i'm assuming so, but you never know
[09:31:52] <awc737> yeah it is loading OK
[09:32:31] <jrockjiggz> dataTables()? <-- with an s
[09:33:36] <awc737> supposed to be singular, http://live.datatables.net/#javascript,html
[09:35:47] <jrockjiggz> awc: do you have url?
[09:35:56] <awc737> jrockjiggz, yeah
[09:36:15] <awc737> actually I think it is probably conflicting with select2 or foundation zurb's .js

[10:18:27] <Yettie> Hello can I get data from an editable div ?
[10:18:31] <invisib> Anyone know of a JS plugin that helps with page transitions, particularly sliding transitions?
[10:18:45] <Yettie> var text = $('div#editable').val();
[10:19:33] <misteroneill> ?text @ Yettie
[10:19:34] <bot-t> Yettie, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[10:19:48] <misteroneill> ?html @ Yettie
[10:19:48] <bot-t> Yettie, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[10:20:11] <Yettie> var text = $('div#editable').val(html);  like this ?
[10:22:30] <Yettie> misteroneill no not like this ...  in this <div>there is text</div> which I want to read out
[10:25:49] <LakWork> is it possible to view all events associated with a dom object in jquery? $(element).data('events') used to work
[10:27:18] <misteroneill> Yettie: it's not hard. $('#editable').text()
[10:28:01] <misteroneill> it's right there in the documentation
[10:28:13] <TheFool> I'm attempting to make a quiz web app where if someone gets the question right the next question (and answer choices) slide in from the bottom and the previous one is pushed out the top.  But when someone gets something wrong it slides off to the left and brings up the next question from the bottom. Any ideas?
[10:28:57] <Yettie> misteroneill as in reference of jquery .val() is correct for my multiple textlines <div id="editable">tere is so much text inside</div>
[10:29:21] <Yettie> but there is no value in this .val() ???
[10:30:10] <misteroneill> .val() is for form fields
[10:30:10] <b-ot> misteroneill, memorised ‚Äúval()‚Äù.
[10:30:18] <misteroneill> ...
[10:31:48] <misteroneill> ?val
[10:31:49] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[10:31:58] <Yettie> I am in a form field
[10:32:14] <misteroneill> a <div> element has no value, so calling val() on it will do nothing
[10:34:23] <Yettie> so it's not possible to get the value of the <div> it's html5
[10:35:14] <TheFool> Yettie: You'll want to use innerHtml
[10:35:34] <misteroneill> "the value of the <div>" doesn't mean anything. if you want the text inside it, use .text(). if you want the html inside it, use .html()
[10:36:11] <Yettie> http://pastebin.com/vrjr3BSh there is my problem
[10:36:44] <TheFool> (Or .text if you don't care about the formatting etc.)
[10:39:21] <Yettie> .text() is not my real solution, because I format all with ckeditor
[10:39:22] <b-ot> Yettie, memorised ‚Äútext()‚Äù.
[10:41:39] <TheFool> then .innerHTML is. It will grab all your div and span tags as well
[10:42:11] <TheFool> (Also can't get your code to actually call that alert function I'm trying to mess with it in jsfiddle)
[10:44:13] <Yettie> Chris___ the problem is, that I also use ckeditor ... textdata can be everything in this <div>
[10:55:16] <Yettie> arrrrgh jquery hates me :(
[11:03:40] <TheFool> Yettie, ahh... gotchya. I've never actually used that editor so I'm not exactly sure what that code looks like.
[11:05:23] <misteroneill> yeah me either. assuming #editable is the editable region, seems like you should use methods of ckeditor to get the contents instead of trying to use jquery?
[11:33:09] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:33:25] <rindolf> Happy new year.
[11:34:56] <BillCriswell> You too!
[11:35:56] <sware> can anyone recommend something to properly format a js file. For some reason this slider js I want to remove some stuff from is all on one line.
[11:38:01] <rindolf> BillCriswell: thanks, what's up?
[11:38:19] <BillCriswell> Work sucks multiple ass.
[11:38:22] <rindolf> sware: hmmm....
[11:38:28] <rindolf> BillCriswell: ah, that's not good.
[11:45:23] <Quix0r> $('body').delay(500); <-- is this recommended?
[11:45:41] <Quix0r> i like to delay a loop without blocking the JS engine
[11:46:20] <Quix0r> 08:45pm here :)
[11:48:11] <sware> this is the js I want to format http://slidesjs.com/examples/standard/js/slides.min.jquery.js  from this slider http://slidesjs.com/examples/standard/ . Want to remove the pagnation stuff, but I don't know js structure well enough to do it without some whitespaces here and there
[11:52:06] <misteroneill> sware: nobody can edit minified code - that's nuts. did you read the documentation? you can turn off the pagination by passing "pagination: false" as one of the options
[11:53:09] <sware> misteroneill: thanks I didn't see that. I'll just use that. Visual studio 2012 actually formatted it nicely though
[11:53:54] <misteroneill> it's a bad idea to edit third-party code
[11:55:30] <sware> even with it turned off I'm still having this issue http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=42733
[11:56:15] <sware> it's autogenerating those links.I have another version of jquery on the page so I seperate them into seperate vars using noconflict. Seems to still be a conflict ;/
[11:58:34] <sware> it's definitely something wrong with the js
[12:00:22] <sware> turns out in this one the var being checked shouldn't be "pagnation" but "generatePagnation" setting it to "generatePagnation: false" worked :)
[12:03:35] <jrockjiggz> could anyone test if this loads in firefox? http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8/jquery.min.js
[12:03:43] <jrockjiggz> it works in chrome, not in firefox.. like..
[12:04:03] <Susan> It works in Chrome and Safari for me. I don't have Firefox handy.
[12:04:15] <jrockjiggz> Susan: ty
[12:04:16] <Susan> Redirects to https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8/jquery.min.js in Chrome due to an extension I have installed.
[12:04:41] <Susan> You should just load jQuery yourself, though. Google is evil.
[12:04:44] <jrockjiggz> yes that works in firefox
[12:05:19] <jrockjiggz> heh. http doesnt work, where https does -.-
[12:05:30] <jrockjiggz> Susan: it seems that way
[12:07:55] <klaphat> I have a problem which I think is really a bug with google chrome, but maybe there is a more creative solution.  Basically I have a page with a lot of buttons that are initially hidden, and depending on certain result that comes back from an ajax call i decide which buttons to show. The problem is that even though the buttons are now "visible", google chrome does not render them. If I resize
[12:07:55] <klaphat> the window--suddenly they appear.
[12:08:26] <eldjb> anyone have an article handy on why it's a bad idea to skin form elements (like select)
[12:08:32] <klaphat> I'm wondering if there is a creative way to make the browser refresh its display or something like that
[12:10:02] <jrockjiggz> klaphat: this may be the answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3485365/how-can-i-force-webkit-to-redraw-repaint-to-propagate-style-changes
[12:11:17] <jrockjiggz> should trick the browser to redraw
[12:14:29] <klaphat> ok checking it out, thanks
[12:20:00] <klaphat> wow surprisingly does not work even though it definitely redrew part of the page
[12:25:50] <klaphat> ok.... i was able to solve it by adding the lines  $('.actionBtn:visible').css('display','block'); $('.actionBtn:visible').css('display','inline');
[12:26:01] <klaphat> inline being what it already was. but just adding the 2nd line didn't work.
[12:28:04] <klaphat> jrockjiggz : thanks though because that link helped me make the solution
[12:37:47] <morfin> how do you think is that good idea to replace whole page using ajax?
[12:38:32] <morfin> i have different templates for login page and for inner page so i should change whole page when user is logged in
[12:39:28] <misteroneill> morfin: what's wrong with having separate pages?
[12:39:41] <morfin> but how i will go to inner page?
[12:39:51] <misteroneill> i don't understand the question
[12:39:59] <morfin> i was thinking to do that without refreshing page
[12:40:19] <misteroneill> well, if you want to build a single-page app you probably want a framework for that
[12:40:20] <morfin> i want to replace whole page by another page retreived with ajax request
[12:40:34] <misteroneill> how is that better than just navigating to another page?
[12:41:05] <morfin> i can retrieve it with ajax and server-side framework(Request::factory($url))
[12:41:16] <misteroneill> eldjb: minor styling is fine (borders and the like), but any more is dangerous. users trust the UI for form fields - they're used to it. from a behavior perspective, form fields are designed specifically for the platform. i.e. selects on desktop vs. mobile. you can seriously break cross-platform compatibility and create a TON of work for yourself duplicating functionality that's already built into the browser
[12:41:20] <morfin> hmmm
[12:41:23] <misteroneill> morfin: you can, but should you?
[12:41:36] <morfin> not sure
[12:41:52] <morfin> i wanted to avoid urls like admin/index etc
[12:43:07] <morfin> actually i think i don't need that
[12:43:29] <klaphat> morfin: i would reccomend that you do that page replacement on the backend - like on the server side ask "am i logged in" and generate the correct page , the url will be the same
[12:44:06] <morfin> i think i'll avoid ugly hacks then
[12:44:13] <klaphat> problem with replacing the whole DOM, even though you can maybe do it--- it could have unexpected results and it will make debugging really hard
[12:44:28] <morfin> i know
[12:44:37] <morfin> last time i had css\js issues
[12:44:49] <morfin> because appended js did not load properly
[12:47:57] <morfin> only proper way to load JS dynamically is using createElement()
[12:48:29] <morfin> in that case browser is loading that js without issues
[13:29:51] <GoSox> how do you know what jquery functions can be chained together?
[13:31:26] <phonebook_> if they return the jquery object/collection (.css("height", "10px"), .animate(...);) then you can chain them. but if they return a value (e.g. .height(), .attr("abc"), .css("background")) you can't chain them.
[13:34:38] <Eviltwin> If the method returns "jQuery" you can call jQuery methods on it
[13:34:39] <Eviltwin> Like this: http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[13:34:53] <Eviltwin> In the top right it says "Returns: jQuery"
[13:35:06] <GoSox> ah so that's what i need to look for
[13:35:43] <Eviltwin> Notice that certain methods may return jQuery for one form and something else for another form
[13:35:57] <Eviltwin> For example .attr("disabled", "disabled") will return "jQuery"
[13:35:58] <GoSox> yup i see
[13:36:00] <GoSox> thats cool
[13:36:04] <Eviltwin> While .attr("disabled") won't
[13:39:49] <Quix0r> http://pastie.org/5603604 <-- some-why I cannot call functions in this script file :(
[13:39:59] <Quix0r> it is being loaded with getScript()
[13:40:00] <pmcgovern> Hello everyone
[13:40:58] <Quix0r> other scripts were also loaded with getScript() and I can call methods in there
[13:40:58] <pmcgovern> I am trying to set the value of a text input with the output of a .get call. The call has a response, but I am assuming that I am not handling the request properly
[13:41:27] <pmcgovern> $("#productName").val($.get('/index.php?action=productNameLookupByID&productID=' + $("#productID").val()));
[13:41:56] <pmcgovern> It is spitting out [object XMLHttpRequest] rather than the value that is passed
[13:42:07] <pmcgovern> thence my assumption of me not handling the request properly :)
[13:42:22] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ pmcgovern
[13:42:23] <bot-t> pmcgovern, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[13:42:32] <Eviltwin> This needs to be done with a callback
[13:42:54] <phonebook_> pmcgovern use the success callback and then its the first argument
[13:43:06] <pmcgovern> got it. Thanks :)
[13:43:07] <Eviltwin> Do $.get('/index...', function(data) { $("#productName").val(data) });
[13:43:12] <Eviltwin> Or something like that
[13:43:39] <Quix0r> Eviltwin: any idea about my problem?
[13:45:01] <Quix0r> ah, got an error
[13:45:13] <Quix0r> unlabeled break must be inside loop or switch / http://localhost/projects/mailer/branches/0.2.1-FINAL/js/admin-network-query-api.js?dummy=1&ext=sql_patches&ver=0.9.6&rev=6264 / Line 72
[13:45:21] <Quix0r> when I include it with <script src>
[13:45:46] <Quix0r> hmm, jquery's loader seems to ignore these errors?
[13:46:12] <GoSox> can i remove all classes on an object with removeClass()?
[13:47:00] <phonebook_> .attr("class, "");
[13:47:02] <GoSox> ah my question is the answer
[13:47:30] <GoSox> removeClass() with no attributes removes all classes
[13:47:36] <GoSox> phonebook_: that was going to be my next guess
[13:48:05] <phonebook_> sorry actually you were right. if you dont provide an argument it removes all classes
[13:49:04] <Quix0r> ?getScripts
[13:49:06] <bot-t> Quix0r, jQuery.getScript() - Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[13:49:14] <Quix0r> ;)
[13:50:23] <Quix0r> how can i break a $.each() loop?
[13:50:30] <phonebook_> return non false
[13:50:50] <phonebook_> thats a continue nm
[13:50:52] <phonebook_> ill just shut up

[14:27:00] <Skyder> Hello
[14:32:11] <jasonabird> Hello
[14:32:34] <GoSox> Hello
[14:32:49] <jasonabird> 3 alive people :-)
[14:33:57] <h4Sx> count me too
[14:36:50] <Skyder> hello
[14:36:58] <Skyder> I am learnd jquery
[14:37:03] <Skyder> can help me?
[15:03:11] <K3|Chris> Gott Nytt √Ör!
[15:11:19] <Caelum> can you bind more than one change handler to an element?
[15:12:48] <Caelum> apparently yes, cool
[15:13:08] <defaultro> what are some expert techniques so that when an html is modified, we will always get the latest one from our browser? Right now, I have to clear my cache to get it to see the latest one. I use $.get to pull the template
[15:14:15] <defaultro> $.get pulls an html template
[15:15:34] <defaultro> maybe, like this $.get("some.html"+microtime(), function(data) { ............
[15:15:38] <defaultro> do you think that will work?
[15:15:41] <monk3y> Put a dummy GET parameter in the request?
[15:15:45] <monk3y> Yeah.
[15:15:51] <monk3y> Wait.
[15:15:52] <defaultro> cool, I'll try that
[15:16:02] <defaultro> forgot ?
[15:16:06] <monk3y> heh yeah
[15:16:07] <defaultro> i forgot question mark :)
[15:16:09] <monk3y> Just what I was typing.
[15:16:19] <defaultro> awesome man
[15:16:29] <defaultro> wow, it's new year and we are still coding, hahaha
[15:16:32] <defaultro> Happy New Year
[15:16:41] <monk3y> That's what the cool-kids do with jquery CDN includes to make sure they get the latest .. or something.  I think.
[15:16:48] <monk3y> Happy New Year to you man.
[15:16:52] <defaultro> coolio! ;)
[15:17:05] <monk3y> I'm from Australia, so all my friends/family have already had theirs .. and I celebrate mine in 6hrs.
[15:17:15] <monk3y> (ie. I'm not in Australia anymore)
[15:17:21] <defaultro> :D us will be 7 hours
[15:17:26] <defaultro> i'm in chicago
[15:17:28] <Caelum> I just got this thing to work, I forgot that the function I was calling has an ajax success handler and wouldn't run synchronously
[15:17:41] <monk3y> So it's kinda like my friends and family travelled 15hrs into the future, and have travelled back in time to tell me how hungover they are (were).
[15:17:52] <defaultro> :D
[15:18:01] <defaultro> aight guys, i'll be back later
[15:18:15] <monk3y> Caelum: can't you tell it to run synchronously .. if that's what you want?
[15:18:51] <Caelum> monk3y: no I don't want that at all, I just did a .one('change' on the element, it's just that I forgot about it and it took a couple hours of debugging to figure out :D
[15:19:17] <monk3y> Ah heh, that'll do it every tiem.
[15:19:24] <monk3y> s/youknowwhatimean
[15:20:12] <jrajav> Caelum: Cool trick when something's going wonky and you know it's related to a certain element - Open Chrome dev tools, Ctrl-Shift-F, paste the element ID, eyeball all sections of code that ref. that element.
[15:21:04] <jrajav> This lands me 95% of all bugs at work
[15:21:46] <MrFox> happy new year! :DD
[15:22:00] <monk3y> Yeah.  I love Chrome dev tools so much that my GF think they're (it's?) the other woman.
[15:22:45] <MrFox> monk3y, buy her something :D
[15:22:57] <jrajav> MrFox: Okay, but then what about the GF?
[15:22:59] <jrajav> ;P
[15:23:03] <Okasu> Hello, how can i make this equetion return true? $($('.field').last().html()) == $('.field').last()
[15:23:03] <MrFox> lol
[15:24:03] <monk3y> jrajav: col (chuckle out loud)
[15:24:23] <Caelum> Okasu: the elements are identical, but they are different object instances
[15:24:42] <ryanneufeld> Okasu: see ?is
[15:24:44] <bot-t> Okasu, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[15:26:48] <Okasu> Caelum: Ok, i need to be more accurate, i want return html of last div with class "field". What i need: <div class="field">foo</div>. What i got with $('.field').last().html() : foo.
[15:28:43] <Hopsy> Happy new year from Holland!
[15:28:53] <Caelum> Okasu: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419749/get-selected-elements-outer-html
[15:30:01] <Okasu> Caelum: Meh, i've already googled it, it's ugly...
[15:30:20] <Okasu> But if it's only option i should accept it.
[15:30:26] <Okasu> Thanks anyway.
[15:30:57] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQ
[15:31:04] <monk3y> Hello Fh.
[15:31:39] <monk3y> coldhead, I presume.
[15:32:05] <coldhead> hej
[15:32:59] <Caelum> Okasu: it is not that ugly: http://jsfiddle.net/kT4yM/
[15:35:08] <Caelum> big discussion in that thread
[15:35:23] <Okasu> function(x,a){return x + a.outerHTML}, "")}
[15:35:29] <Okasu> Ouch
[15:35:45] <Okasu> $.fn.ohtml = function(){return [].reduce.call($(this),function(x,a){return x + a.outerHTML}, "")}
[15:36:37] <Hopsy> Happy new year from Holland! @ coldhead
[15:36:54] <Caelum> as long as you don't need to support ancient browsers, that's perfectly fine...
[15:37:05] <exbm> i am trying to wrap my head around the ui widget factory
[15:37:45] <Hopsy> its 2013 and still slow speed internet connection :(
[15:38:25] <coldhead> thanks Hopsy ! happy 2013
[15:38:37] <exbm> when objects are defined the factory object they should be unique to each instance of the widget?
[15:38:47] <Hopsy> thank you
[15:38:50] <coldhead> it's 2013 and you have an internet connection, be happy
[15:39:39] <exbm> so if i define object: { toast: hot}
[15:40:09] <exbm> in the factory ui then the later it is changed to object: {toast: cold}
[15:40:15] <Hopsy> I want fast, YOLO!
[15:40:37] <exbm> it shouldn't change for _all_ widgets?
[15:41:54] <tw2113> give it to Hopsy faster
[15:43:08] <alexwaters> does anyone have any advice for how I could optimize the jQuery here: http://jsfiddle.net/h7pxU/1820/
[15:43:08] <exbm> you guys got any tips?
[15:43:43] <alexwaters> i'm trying to reduce the amount of jquery there
[15:48:53] <Quix0r> happy new year 2013
[15:48:55] <tw2113> $("#contact, #faq").removeClass("selected");
[15:49:03] <tw2113> i think that would work alexwaters
[15:49:27] <nocturne7> alexwaters, why are you using live(), use on() instead
[15:52:08] <tw2113> hoping this helps http://jsfiddle.net/tw2113/h7pxU/1823/ alexwaters
[16:05:50] <exbm> alexwaters: http://jsfiddle.net/h7pxU/1825/
[16:08:55] <exbm> alexwaters: http://jsfiddle.net/h7pxU/1826/ fixed a mistake but that is half size?
[16:09:21] <alexwaters> exbm: better yet - how can I turn these http://jsfiddle.net/77APe/ two functions into one? I was hoping for a more generic function that acts on any .click events that occur on elements with class "showhide"
[16:10:04] <alexwaters> exbm: ah thank you
[16:10:39] <alexwaters> oops. i meant how can I turn these two functions into one: http://jsfiddle.net/77APe/1/
[16:16:32] <exbm> alexwaters: this is a small plugin i wrote
[16:16:33] <exbm> http://jsfiddle.net/TsmBy/2/
[16:18:13] <exbm> it is sensitive to the order of html
[16:18:37] <exbm> has to be <h2><a>link</a></h2> THEN <p></p>
[16:23:02] <exbm> i am having a problem with the jquery ui
[16:23:20] <exbm> problem with the jquery ui widget factory
[16:30:50] <alexwaters> exbm: I don't understand this line - $root.children('h2').find('a').on('click.jxnAcrdn',¬†function¬†(e)¬†{
[16:31:06] <tw2113> in the variable $root
[16:31:15] <tw2113> select the kids of h2
[16:31:24] <tw2113> then find inside those h2's all a links
[16:31:39] <coldhead> children AND find, way to be
[16:31:40] <tw2113> and on click of them, run this function
[16:31:50] <tw2113> exbm, will have to explain the jxnAcrdn part
[16:32:13] <alexwaters> why do people always pass e as an arguement? I don't see it being used in the function
[16:32:26] <alexwaters> argument*
[16:32:39] <tw2113> that's a variable that holds the event, in this case, click
[16:32:47] <tw2113> i frequently do that and do e.preventDefault()
[16:32:57] <tw2113> which i've been told is better practice than return false;
[16:33:14] <alexwaters> interesting, thank you
[16:33:31] <alexwaters> any chance you could tell me why this doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/77APe/3/ (I think it's related to the above)
[16:33:37] <coldhead> if ( $(e.target).is('.magic') ) doMagic();
[16:37:29] <Jobbe-> hi
[16:38:23] <exbm> alexwaters: i have made it a little easier to read
[16:38:25] <exbm> http://jsfiddle.net/TsmBy/8/
[16:41:48] <Jobbe-> So .. i'm working on a little JS script for a table with days/hours .. and i got a small problem with the selection part (it's made of a table, where the rows each got a unique ID andi selectable) .. when mouse down the first element aint selected. i know how to fix this, but then i can't click and select a single element .. any ideas? http://pastebin.com/bZEnBSDa
[16:43:36] <alexwaters> exbm: thank you =)
[16:44:21] <Jobbe-> actually, this is the right paste - had a small error in the other: http://pastebin.com/3TLAeCHw
[16:46:24] <exbm> jobbe i would use on('click') it is the best way to bind click handlers
[16:46:35] <exbm> unless you want to click and drag?
[16:47:36] <exbm> I would bind to mousedown on the container table
[16:48:23] <exbm> $(table).on('mousedown', 'td.selectable', function () {})
[16:48:43] <exbm> then have an array that you pop each selection
[16:49:01] <exbm> then parse that array on $(table).on('mouseup')
[16:49:25] <Jobbe-> exbm i want click and drag
[16:49:34] <Jobbe-> but also click select
[16:49:43] <exbm> $(table).on('mousedown', 'td.selectable', function () { array.pop($(selected))});
[16:50:22] <Jobbe-> i add a class to the rows selected
[16:50:41] <Jobbe-> i then run though the elements that have that class late
[16:51:19] <exbm> $(table).on('mouseup', function () { $.each(array, function (get all values))  });
[16:51:53] <exbm> no need to hit the dom twice
[16:52:20] <Jobbe-> so what about adding a bg color ?
[16:55:24] <exbm> might be do on mouse down then set mouse down flag
[16:55:31] <exbm> the on hover
[16:55:41] <exbm> then set flag mouse up
[16:57:06] <Jobbe-> i'll try look into it thansk
[17:01:35] <GoSox> Is there a way to submit a form "just enough" to trigger the browsers auto-complete stuff (aka asking you if you want to remember login/password) but not actually submitting the form, so I can process all the data with javascript instead?
[17:04:49] <eddiemonge> now i understand why people come in here to ask js questions instead of ##javascript
[17:07:30] <monk3y> Javascript? I come in here to meet chicks.
[17:08:14] <GoSox> i come here to debate why TNG and DS9 were so good, yet VOY and ENT were so bad.
[17:09:14] <monk3y> Funnily, neither of us leaves satisfied.
[17:09:44] <GoSox> not true, i leave confident that i am right and everyone else is wrong and stupid
[17:10:13] <monk3y> And I  . ... I leave alone.
[17:10:23] <GoSox> with the internet, are you ever really alone?
[17:11:13] <eddiemonge> i thought ds9 was horrible and enterprise was entertaining
[17:11:43] <monk3y> console.log($('#jquery girls').length) // prints "0".
[17:11:45] * monk3y sighs
[17:13:25] <phonebook_> you guys want to see a picture i drew?
[17:14:19] <coldhead> sure, why not
[17:15:30] <phonebook_> http://tinypic.com/r/iylxn8/6
[17:16:00] <GoSox> i don't get it
[17:16:35] <phonebook_> the first number is where i am at. the second number is where i would like to be by the end of the year. and then the entire thing is me making an ass out of myself
[17:17:10] <phonebook_> pretty good huh
[17:17:32] <GoSox> I was afraid i was going to be clicking on a picture of your penis
[17:17:42] <GoSox> but i'm thinking that would have been better
[17:18:18] <exbm> jobbe, http://jsfiddle.net/77APe/15/
[17:18:20] <phonebook_> if you look closely at that picture....
[17:19:00] <exbm> fucker quit
[17:20:39] <exbm> can anyone help me with a problem i have with ui widgetfactory?
[17:21:37] <phonebook_> exbm, what is the problem?
[17:22:32] <exbm> when you are using the widget factory are the objects and functions you assign in the widget object unqiue to each widget?
[17:23:17] <exbm> like if i have an widget({ object: {pizza: 'hot'}});
[17:23:24] <phonebook_> i think it depends on how you access them. youre all set up with the bridge design pattern?
[17:23:40] <exbm> then later it changes to object: {pizza: 'cold'}
[17:24:03] <exbm> will it be unique to that widget
[17:24:36] <phonebook_> as long as you declare your object inside that widget it will be
[17:25:21] <exbm> that's the problem i am having
[17:26:06] <exbm> I declare cache: {stack: [], add: function(), get: function() {}}
[17:26:47] <exbm> the problem is even though i declared that inside the widget factory object it is being shared by all the widgets globaly
[17:27:35] <coldhead> phonebook_: what do the metallic cylinders represent?
[17:27:49] <phonebook_> database
[17:27:49] <coldhead> mass?
[17:27:53] <coldhead> ah
[17:27:55] <phonebook_> or mass, same thign
[17:28:03] <coldhead> and the atomic structurey thing?
[17:28:12] <coldhead> is that "science" or "physics"
[17:28:16] <exbm> the cache object i declared is only access within the widget's methods like this.cache.add()
[17:28:23] <phonebook_> those are penis pills
[17:28:40] <coldhead> i... see
[17:28:48] <coldhead> it's a very nice infographic
[17:28:51] <coldhead> good luck with that
[17:29:07] <exbm> i've notice that in chrome this has to object element, and options then all the other objects are under proto
[17:30:00] <exbm> why are element and options straight under this and all methods and objects i declared under proto?
[17:32:45] <exbm> a.widget.a.(anonymous function).(anonymous function) ..element: v.fn.v.init[1] ..options: Object ..__proto__: a.Widget ....Cache: Object
[17:32:50] <exbm> oops
[17:33:31] <exbm> can someone help explain ?
[17:35:48] <phonebook_> i dont know if i can help. but if you could break it down to a clean fiddle that demonstrates the problem and ask here and on stackoverflow your odds of getting an answer go way up
[18:01:08] <aghouseh> hey all, im struggling with a design pattern. i want to bind a function to an event, but also run that same function on page load.
[18:01:35] <aghouseh> it seems really clunky to define the function, then bind it to the click handler, and also run it on ready
[18:01:51] <aghouseh> (its for a checkbox-related enable/disable)
[18:02:58] <phonebook_> var x = function() { alert("hi"); }; $(document).ready(function() { x(); $("div").on("click", x); });
[18:03:56] <phonebook_> you coudl put it into a self executing function
[18:04:02] <aghouseh> thats basically what i have now..
[18:04:03] <aghouseh> hm
[18:04:12] <phonebook_> like this...
[18:05:17] <tw2113> ryanneufeld, just finally got the "followed by" email. It was in a digest
[18:05:39] <ryanneufeld> partially digested email... ewww....
[18:06:57] <phonebook_> http://jsfiddle.net/GknY5/
[18:07:19] <phonebook_> ive never found a way to get it to self execute and then be able to call it as a function (not as a property of an object)
[18:07:35] <aghouseh> but then yea
[18:07:50] <aghouseh> i guess thats what i was wondering
[18:08:07] <phonebook_> we should ask in javascript
[18:08:09] <aghouseh> though you did save me a shortcut.. as i was calling the function within an anon function rather than just passing it as the 3rd arg for .on()
[18:08:36] <coldhead> $('.something').bind('click', function () { /*...*/ }).trigger('click');
[18:09:12] <aghouseh> hah true
[18:09:57] <aghouseh> except im using an .on() :/
[18:11:28] <coldhead> that's even better: two fewer characters
[18:12:12] <phonebook_> some genuis in #javascript just gave the answer http://jsfiddle.net/GknY5/2/
[18:12:40] <aghouseh> yeah i actually googled something diff and found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6090912/javascript-self-executing-function
[18:14:15] <aghouseh> erm cant get it to work :(
[18:20:37] <aghouseh> http://jsfiddle.net/MBFG2/4/
[18:24:34] <alexwaters> i'm trying to make this div appear when a user clicks the link, and then disappear if they click anywhere outside the div: http://jsfiddle.net/77APe/19/ any ideas as to why it's not working?
[18:25:19] <alexwaters> it works without the hide-when-outside-click logic. but I think there's a problem with making the div visible and then hiding it immediately
[18:27:44] <aghouseh> phonebook_: falling flat! http://jsfiddle.net/MBFG2/8/
[18:28:40] <coldhead> alexwaters: you need an e.stopPropagation()
[18:29:02] <coldhead> also the way you get myClass could betray you if something adds extra classes
[18:29:21] <coldhead> i would go more for something like this http://jsfiddle.net/77APe/20/
[18:30:51] <tw2113> you're already in 2013 right coldhead ?
[18:32:09] <alexwaters> coldhead: wow thank you. perfect
[18:32:09] <coldhead> sure am
[18:32:39] <coldhead> alexwaters: you still have the problem that you are binding a new click() event every time they click your link
[18:32:50] <phonebook_> is this it? http://jsfiddle.net/MBFG2/10/
[18:33:18] <aghouseh> hm seems to be
[18:33:51] <aghouseh> weird
[18:34:15] <phonebook_> it fials if you click the very top one and then the second one down. but it doesnt fail if you click the bottom one and then the third from the bottom
[18:34:43] <aghouseh> yea
[18:35:49] <coldhead> alexwaters: http://jsfiddle.net/77APe/21/
[18:35:50] <phonebook_> ah sry
[18:36:03] <aghouseh> yea no class on the first item! got that much anyway
[18:36:05] <phonebook_> i didnt put the class back on that top one. the class is missing on the top one
[18:36:06] <tw2113> 2013 worth it yet? or is it just typical?
[18:36:07] <aghouseh> awesome yea it works for me in cide now
[18:36:12] <aghouseh> er in my code
[18:36:17] <aghouseh> weird, i cant figure out what i was missinog
[18:36:51] <coldhead> tw2113: if you play your cards right you can start the year with good provisions of leftover food and alcohol

[18:47:17] <tw2113> .hide()
