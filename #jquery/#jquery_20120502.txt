[00:08:29] <Cork> nilesh007: is the xml file on your server?
[00:10:27] <nilesh007> no,on local system
[00:13:07] <nilesh007> cork please help me!
[00:13:44] <Cork> nilesh007: you would need to use the file api and a file picker to access the local system
[00:13:57] <Cork> nilesh007: websites can't access it normally
[00:14:14] <ravenzz> morning
[00:14:20] <Cork> o/
[00:14:25] <ravenzz> ;)
[00:16:10] <ravenzz> well I hope that someone could help me to figure out why this crazy thing is happen. http://jsfiddle.net/GpX2t/14/ focus on the bottom (the form submit), to reproduce the issue pick some values up from the list and submit the form, then take a look at the console
[00:18:28] <Cork> ravenzz: your appending jquery objects to self
[00:18:38] <Cork> i think you want $.map() and not .map()
[00:18:51] <Cork> (not saying its the cause of your problem)
[00:19:57] <ravenzz> well actually I saw that the type of the value is an Object even in an new fiddle where I only have a multiselect
[00:20:03] <ravenzz> without other js
[00:20:51] <ravenzz> I mean typeof selectValue returns an object
[00:21:06] <Cork> ya, but jquery is an object
[00:21:06] <ravenzz> but if I do a console debug / dir it is an array
[00:21:07] <ravenzz> ?!
[00:21:18] <Cork> and arrays is objects too
[00:21:53] <ravenzz> ok so i correct
[00:22:01] <Cork> no
[00:22:04] <ravenzz> -"ok so i"
[00:22:13] <ravenzz> :p
[00:22:21] <Cork> $(selector).find().map() will return a jquery object
[00:22:23] <Cork> you want an array
[00:22:46] <ravenzz> I see
[00:22:51] <Cork> so you should do $.map($(selector).find(), function(elm) { $(elm) }) will return a jquery object
[00:22:53] <ravenzz> let me try with $.map
[00:22:53] <Cork> opps
[00:22:57] <Cork> *so you should do $.map($(selector).find(), function(elm) { $(elm) })
[00:23:28] <ravenzz> yeah well I know the difference
[00:23:32] <Cork> it won't remove the duplicate values, but you will get an array and not waist all the memory
[00:23:40] <ravenzz> but I didn't thinked about that
[00:24:44] <coldhead> M-? is undefined
[00:24:48] <jibbajabb> hi, I'm having trouble trying to find the answer to this, although there are loads of information everythign seems to side step this component: Is there a way to serialise javascript object with functions and deserialise it back again ?
[00:25:21] <Cork> jibbajabb: in some browsers
[00:25:23] <Cork> but not all
[00:25:40] <ravenzz> ok anyway seems that it doesn't solve the problem
[00:25:56] <jibbajabb> or would I need to write custom function to serialise my object (although some sites state that you shouldn't need to do this since JSON.stringify would do the job, but dont address how I can do it with an object with a function)
[00:26:04] <Cork> ravenzz: looks like your adding the values twice somewhere
[00:26:15] <ravenzz> I don't know how :|
[00:26:24] <Cork> jibbajabb: functions is invalid in json
[00:26:26] <becom33> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ Im using this autocomplete on a script . the problem Im having Is this will alow you to submit even something which isnt in the list . for a example to a project when we select users . you can't select users which arnt in the list . what can I do to fix that ?
[00:26:28] <jibbajabb> Cork: I tried using JSON.Stringify and it is stating that I have a circular reference
[00:26:36] <Cork> jibbajabb: only static data is allowed
[00:26:51] <jibbajabb> Cork : I don't want the function to be serialised, only the member properties
[00:27:31] <Cork> jibbajabb: then you prob refering to a parent from a child
[00:27:50] <Cork> jibbajabb: so you need to break that link
[00:27:50] <becom33> anyone for me ?
[00:28:48] <jibbajabb> So if i have an object of function car(obj){this.name = obj.name; this.tyres=[]; this.move = function(){//something}} I only want the name and tyres serialised
[00:30:20] <jibbajabb> Cork : if break the link then then I'll have trouble ascertaining which object the child object belongs to. In that example of a car, the tyres array contains instances of tyre objects. How would I break that link ?
[00:30:46] <becom33> :( anyone ??
[00:31:27] <Cork> ?eval function car(obj){this.name = obj.name; this.tyres=[]; this.move = function(){} }; var t = new car({ name: 'test' }); JSON.stringify(t) @jibbajabb
[00:31:29] <bot-t> jibbajabb: "{\"name\":\"test\",\"tyres\":[]}"
[00:32:18] <becom33> :/ am I invisible ? at least some body tell you can see what Im typing here
[00:32:46] <Bubbi> becom33: don't be silly, you are not invisble... You are being ignored ;-)
[00:33:05] <becom33> great :/
[00:33:18] <Bubbi> becom33: What is your problem...?
[00:33:25] <becom33> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ Im using this autocomplete on a script . the problem Im having Is this will alow you to submit even something which isnt in the list . for a example to a project when we select users . you can't select users which arnt in the list . what can I do to fix that ?
[00:33:32] <Cork> becom33: what you need to do is validate the data when the form is submitted
[00:33:37] <coldhead> becom33: autocomplete might have a better option but i would just write some code that prevents a submission if the entry isn't in the list
[00:33:46] <coldhead> LET'S ALL TALK TO BECOM33
[00:33:53] <Cork> :D
[00:34:04] <Cork> coldhead: sometimes you want that
[00:34:17] <Bubbi> one of you take care of that then ;-)
[00:34:23] <Cork> ex. if your looking up a reference id in the database or something
[00:34:42] <jibbajabb>  ?eval function car(obj){this.name = obj.name; parent=obj.parent; this.tyres=[]; this.move = function(){} }; var t = new car({ name: 'test', parent: this }); JSON.stringify(t)
[00:34:57] <coldhead> DON'T TELL ME WHAT I WANT, CORK
[00:35:01] <jibbajabb> sorry just trying out with parent in there
[00:35:03] <coldhead> I BARELY KNOW MYSELF
[00:35:03] <becom33> ok CromeDome  what kinda thing I should used to do that ? coldhead help me out here . how can prevent somthing like that ?
[00:35:10] <Bubbi> Using jQuery Mobile, I have an issue with events not firing on radiobuttons. Anybody have any experience with this?
[00:35:27] <Cork> jibbajabb: you need to defind what the parent is
[00:35:42] <Cork> jibbajabb: your giving it the dom element right now
[00:35:46] <coldhead> becom33: bind a submit() handler that checks the current value and returns false to prevent submission
[00:35:47] <jibbajabb> did that work... just got disconnected
[00:35:49] <Cork> uh.. * window element
[00:36:05] <Cork> jibbajabb: you had a space before the ?eval
[00:36:16] <Cork> jibbajabb: but run it in your browsers console
[00:36:32] <jibbajabb> Cork : Sorry, in my actual code this is being created within another object (say a group of cars)
[00:36:37] <jibbajabb> ok thanks
[00:36:54] <Cork> jibbajabb: if your giving an object the object isn't cloned
[00:37:00] <becom33> coldhead, Im using this in a big form . soo when I submit even its going trough a ajax .. :/ if I could get a simple example that would be great :)
[00:37:06] <nilesh007> help me
[00:37:15] <Cork> jibbajabb: so you would risk having circular references
[00:38:32] <jibbajabb> Yeah i just tried that out and it gave me a circular reference. So is there anotehr way where I can keep track of what the parent is ?
[00:40:41] <Cork> jibbajabb: either make sure the object doesn't loop
[00:41:00] <Cork> jibbajabb: or use an object and refere to the parent as a key name
[00:41:15] <Cork> cars[car.parent].name
[00:41:33] <Bubbi> Is it not possible to bind live events, using .on() to radio buttons with jQuery Mobile? It seems that it won't fire the events
[00:41:57] <becom33> coldhead, umm ? sorry if im disturbing . just wondering since its been a while
[00:42:09] <ravenzz> Cork would you suggest to me to use unique() ?
[00:43:08] <Bubbi> Anybody here worked with jQuery mobile?
[00:43:14] <ravenzz> even though it is merely hacky
[00:44:12] <coldhead> becom33: i can't find an example for you, i was just giving you the approach i'd take
[00:44:31] <becom33> aghh alright
[00:44:37] <coldhead> becom33: if you don't figure it out or get a better answer ask here when east coast north america is awake
[00:44:41] <coldhead> those dudes loves autocomplete
[00:45:24] <NodeX> lol
[00:46:19] <dgx> Does jQuery UI has its own channel or should I ask here?
[00:46:28] <Eviltwin> Technically it's here
[00:46:33] <Eviltwin> But most of us don't care for supporting it
[00:46:53] <dgx> How come?
[00:47:06] <Eviltwin> Because we're purists
[00:47:24] <Cork> purist while using jquery? :)
[00:48:20] <lb> pure jQuery
[00:48:43] <dgx> Okay, how can I remove this top image on the dialog of jQuery UI?
[00:49:10] <dgx> I guess with the CSS would be fine, right?
[00:49:34] <Cork> yes
[00:49:58] <Cork> you mean the title image?
[00:50:51] <jibbajabb> Cork : thank you I think I get what you meant...
[00:51:02] <jibbajabb> I'll give it a shot
[00:51:07] <Cork> dgx: .dialog .ui-diwget-header { background: transparent; }
[00:51:13] <Cork> *widget
[00:51:58] <dgx> Cork: Yes, that's great, thanks.
[00:52:59] <Whirl3d> quick question about loading parts of an html document using .load...if have a div with id='profile' and I want to load the profile page content with the same ID into it, should i modify the url to $("#profile").load(url+" #profile")...in other words, will I end up with profile inside of profile or just one?
[00:53:48] <Whirl3d> I am sure there's a better way to ask that, but I couldn't for the life of me get it out. LOL
[00:53:54] <advorak> According to the docs, $.load defaults to using get, but when I specify data, it defaults to post … is there a way to force it to use get?
[00:54:04] <Cork> Whirl3d: the element you select will be put into the element
[00:54:20] <Whirl3d> inside the element, not replacing the element?
[00:54:25] <Cork> inside
[00:54:35] <Cork> if you load the same page
[00:54:53] <Cork> and reload through $.load you will have the id twice
[00:55:32] <Whirl3d> I have empty placeholder div's for each "section"....but the pages themselves have the same structure (as separate html docs) with same ids. So I need to wrap the contents and just load the contents.
[00:55:49] <advorak> Found it .. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1488593/how-can-i-use-jquery-load-to-perform-a-get-request-while-passing-extra-parameter -- $.param will help with the get ...
[00:55:58] <Cork> Whirl3d: why do you need the wrapping elements at all?
[00:56:14] <Cork> just do $('#profile').load('profile.html')
[00:56:28] <Cork> (or .php or what ever your using)
[00:57:15] <Cork> Whirl3d: preferably you only want to send the data you want, and not load it and throw away things
[00:58:10] <Whirl3d> in profile.html, I have (as a child of the body element) a < div class='section id='profile' > so wouldn't it load a profile id div into the existing <div class='section' id='profile'> that I am using as a placeholder?
[00:58:48] <Cork> Whirl3d: do you need to have a full html page in profile.html?
[00:59:01] <Cork> or could it just be a partial with the block you want to send
[00:59:19] <Whirl3d> That's how the site was setup beforehand, I was just trying to maintain their structure for convenience.
[00:59:30] <Whirl3d> Hell, I'd put all the shit in one file, it's not a lot of content
[00:59:49] <Cork> Whirl3d: well then you could use $.get and then replace the parent element instead
[00:59:58] <Cork> its prob the cleanest way to do it
[01:00:42] <Whirl3d> hmmm. Let me get there real quick and you can tell me if I am getting you right or not. Thanks (as always) for your help.
[01:10:53] <Flo0815> guys, i really need some help: http://jsfiddle.net/e66Wf/1/
[01:11:21] <Flo0815> i don't understand why it always says, the column-height is 0
[01:12:28] <Cork> Flo0815: your code's broken
[01:12:44] <Flo0815> hm?
[01:12:57] <Cork> m.column, function() isn't valid js
[01:13:06] <Flo0815> oh
[01:13:09] <Flo0815> sec
[01:13:34] <Flo0815> http://jsfiddle.net/e66Wf/3/
[01:14:54] <Cork> Flo0815: depending on the browser you need to append the element to the dom to get height
[01:15:14] <Cork> oh wait it is
[01:15:29] <Cork> Flo0815: could you make a working demo?
[01:16:02] <Flo0815> working on it
[01:18:53] <zuaibh> hello
[01:19:13] <zuaibh> today i am gonna start learning jquery
[01:19:45] <Cork> O_o
[01:19:46] <Cork> ok?
[01:20:32] <NodeX> lmao
[01:23:46] <Flo0815> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/e66Wf/4/
[01:24:04] <Flo0815> but i don't understand this, it gives me he height now...
[01:24:10] <Flo0815> *the
[01:25:06] <Cork> except you used the wrong id, but ya it works
[01:27:52] <Flo0815> Cork: is a element's height zero if it's not displayed? like display: none; ?
[01:28:28] <Articate> How can I check if #id is in somethings .children()?
[01:31:25] <NodeX> $('.something').find("#id");
[01:33:13] <xec> Articate: if you mean descendants use what NodeX just said. if you really mean (direct) children you can supply a selector to children. $(".something > #id") is equivalent to $(".something").children("#id")
[01:33:30] <Cork> Flo0815: yes
[01:33:50] <Articate> thanks :)
[01:34:08] <ravenzz> uhm
[01:34:49] <Flo0815> Cork: is it possible to get a hidden elemts height?
[01:35:09] <Cork> display: <normal>; visibility: hidden;
[01:35:33] <Cork> if its display: none, it doesn't take any space so its correct height is 0
[01:41:42] <ravenzz> ajpiano are you there?
[01:47:31] <Flo0815> Cork: thank you very much, it works now.
[01:48:50] <granden> Best way to format a date in jquery? I got it like this 2012-05-02 10:40:00
[01:49:00] <granden> want 2/5
[01:49:09] <granden> and 10:40 but in two different variables.
[01:49:48] <Cork> granden: check javascript i've answerd there
[01:50:01] <Cork> jquery doesn't provide stirng formating helpers
[01:50:07] <granden> Cork: Woops missed that, sorry.
[01:58:02] <Articate> Hmm. I don't quite know how I should approach this. I'm using AnythingSlider if that's something anyone's used before:
[01:58:21] <r3za> hi guys, does anyone know what script should i use to make such menu like this : http://i.imgur.com/RIu9F.jpg , i know its flyout menu but i need exactly like it
[01:59:24] <Articate> the anything slider adds two arrows to an image, and let's you cycle through a list of images. Now, I want to do something when i reach a certain slide
[02:00:19] <Articate> I see that when I cycle to the next image, the script adds .activePage to that panel. So I figured I'd check what child the panel with .activePage has
[02:01:07] <Articate> the problem is that I fire off that check when someone cycles, ie clicks one of the arrows. That's also when the script adds .activePage, and now my check is done before the class is actually added
[02:01:23] <Articate> so I only find that child when I move away from that slide
[02:01:29] <r3za> hi guys, does anyone know what script should i use to make such menu like this : http://i.imgur.com/RIu9F.jpg , i know its flyout menu but i need exactly like it
[02:02:22] <Articate> anythingSlider is jQuery
[02:02:51] <Articate> is there a way to make it check when I know .activePage is added?
[02:07:34] <r3za> hi guys, does anyone know what script should i use to make such menu like this : http://i.imgur.com/RIu9F.jpg , i know its flyout menu but i need exactly like it
[02:11:10] <Cork> r3za: you won't find a plugin that looks exactly like that
[02:11:31] <Cork> r3za: you might find one that has the same functionality, but you will have to theme it your self
[02:11:57] <Cork> you could have a look at jquery-ui menu
[02:12:10] <Cork> it should be able to get you farly close
[02:12:14] <r3za> Cork : oh hey cork , its fine , i dont want exactly like it
[02:12:24] <r3za> Cork : i theme it for my self
[02:13:46] <Whirl3d> r3za, did you think you would get a different answer from the one you got last night when you asked the same question?
[02:14:31] <coldhead> hey it's worth a shot
[02:14:38] <Whirl3d> Articate, you can enable the option  in AnythingSlider to change the hash on slide change. Then you could monitor hash changes for the page you want.
[02:14:54] <Articate> But that refreshes the page, doesn't it?
[02:14:59] <Whirl3d> no
[02:15:14] <Whirl3d> Browsers don't pay attention to anything after the hash, apparently.
[02:15:43] <Articate> Right, what I meant is that it buggers up back-button functionality
[02:16:04] <Whirl3d> I'm pretty sure that's why it is setup that way
[02:16:14] <Whirl3d> So that when you press the back button, it loads the previous slide
[02:16:25] <Whirl3d> it also allows you to bookmark slides.
[02:16:35] <Articate> but that's not what the back-button should do :)
[02:17:04] <Whirl3d> Who says? If you are changing content and want to go back to the previous content, you press back, right?
[02:17:21] <Whirl3d> well the slider optionally allows you to provide that function
[02:17:58] <Articate> How would I check what's after the hashtag?
[02:18:03] <Whirl3d> I use the hashchange plugin from Ben Allmen (sp?) and it works great
[02:18:15] <Whirl3d> location.hash will give you the hash value
[02:19:23] <Articate> I don't think the back-button should open up the previous menu in a "press to see sub-menus" page, which I suppose is the same logic going into not wanting to go back to the previous slide with the back-button :)
[02:19:30] <Whirl3d> and loading hashchange plugin will allow you to setup a listener on the window for hashchange events like $(window).hashchange(function () { var hashRef=location.hash; if (hashRef=="#"+myslideid) {do stuff})});
[02:19:51] <Whirl3d> then disable that feature
[02:20:02] <Articate> then how do I achieve what I want? :)
[02:20:25] <Whirl3d> Magic is your best solution if you refuse to use the tools your plugins provide you.
[02:20:47] <Articate> I think a better answer would be "that's the only way I can think of"
[02:20:59] <Whirl3d> Actually I can think of others, but they are so messy.
[02:21:12] <Whirl3d> You could setup an interval timer that constantly checks the current page
[02:21:40] <Whirl3d> you could read up on the api for anythingSlider (which I know the docs leave something to be desired) and perhaps there's a callback on slide change that you could enable
[02:22:11] <Whirl3d> *current slide, not current page, sorry
[02:22:40] <Articate> thanks. I'll check into that. And I'll definitely keep your other suggestion in mind. It's definitely the prettiest, it's just I wish it wouldn't interfere with the back-button
[02:23:19] <Articate> and I'm sure that's something our customers can suddenly go "well, I don't want it to do that" about
[02:23:24] <Whirl3d> check out the plugin I mentioned. I believe you can control what is and isn't pushed to the history of your browser using it.
[02:23:35] <Articate> that's nice.
[02:24:14] <Whirl3d> then , let the slider try to change the hash, capture it and don't push it to the history. I can't guarantee that it works like that, but I think that's the idea.
[02:24:38] <Articate> thanks :)
[02:25:17] <Whirl3d> np.  Look into the api for the slider plugin. I can't imagine they don't have a hook for the current page.
[02:26:57] <Jagan_> hi
[02:28:21] <Whirl3d> hello...
[02:28:34] <Jagan_> i  want to use tooltip for textfield validation.. if the text field value doesnot correct it should show the error msg? can anyone help me?
[02:31:32] <Whirl3d> ? demo @ Jagan_
[02:31:33] <bot-t> Jagan_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:34:34] <Cork> Jagan_: just set the message in the elms title attribute
[02:36:52] <Jagan_> But the tiltle  should appear as tooltip once the field contains wrong value
[02:37:43] <granden> Using phonegap and jquery / jquerymobile to build a simple app.
[02:38:04] <granden> And in one div there is a lot of content that needs to be scrolled, everything works ok. But
[02:38:17] <granden> When scrolling it stops and dont continue if I let go
[02:38:30] <granden> Dont know what that type of scrolling is about
[02:39:57] <Jagan_> Whirl3d, consider i hav to textfiled when onblur a validation function sholud call and if it contains invalid value that toolip should appear
[02:40:33] <Jagan_> Whirl3d, consider i hav two textfiled when onblur a validation function sholud call and if it contains invalid value that toolip should appear
[02:41:11] <Whirl3d> Jagan, I am familiar with the effect that you are wanting to create, but without your exact implementation, it's nearly impossible to troubleshoot.
[02:41:45] <Whirl3d> THere are lots of plugins that do what you want, have you looked into using a plugin for this effect?
[02:42:05] <Cork> wb bot-t
[02:42:21] <Jagan_> ok whirl3d. i wil try
[02:43:21] <Whirl3d> granden, are you talking about "momentum" ? In other words, you want it to slide to a stop rather than just stopping?
[02:45:35] <Whirl3d> Jagan_, you might want to check out : http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/
[02:50:02] <evildmp> if you look at http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/slider-test/ and use the lightboxes, navigating left and right through them (select an image to start) you will see that there is a small but annoying glitch while it works out the height
[02:50:13] <evildmp> can anyone suggest a way to make that smoother?
[02:51:46] <Whirl3d> are you talking about the fact that it renders the image height, then adds the "readmore" link (making the image bigger, so it jumps a bit)
[02:54:01] <Whirl3d> evildmp, if that is the problem, then you could change the CSS for your ReadMore links to float them to the right and up a little (effectively making it so the image isn't any taller when added)
[02:54:06] <Articate> Whirl3d: You were right. There was a callback :)
[02:54:19] <Whirl3d> Glad to hear it!
[02:56:15] <evildmp> Whirl3d: thanks for the suggestion - though if you look again, I have removed them entirely, and the glitch is still apparent
[02:56:25] <evildmp> but maybe it's slightly less noticeable
[02:57:24] <Whirl3d> evildmp, try making the headlines (above the image area) overlap the image
[02:57:55] <Whirl3d> it appears to jump that exact amount (the amount of the readme and the top headline or now, just the top headline)
[02:58:15] <HardFu> anyone knows if I can achieve the same result with normal divs: http://www.joelambert.co.uk/flux/ (the turn effect)
[02:58:48] <Whirl3d> evildmp, and if that is the problem, then just add transparent space in your images to accomodate the headline.
[02:58:52] <evildmp> Whirl3d: i think *any* text causes it
[02:59:18] <evildmp> there's no guarantee how tall the headlines, or any other text will be
[02:59:31] <evildmp> so it may not be soluble
[02:59:54] <Whirl3d> evildmp, tell lightbox (or whatever) to use a different source for your element
[03:00:34] <Whirl3d> then, if nothing else, wrap all the pieces in a div that is display:"inline-block" to make it adapt to the size of your content
[03:01:16] <evildmp> Whirl3d: well, what it's doing is grabbing for example http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/arkestra-lightbox-item/141/600/ and rendering that in the lightbox
[03:01:37] <evildmp> i shall try inline-block
[03:02:07] <greg_f> Hello! Is it possible to simplyfy selector http://jsfiddle.net/T7buc/ and how?
[03:02:18] <Whirl3d> so, you grab that first, add your headline and some blank space (for the readme) and pass that new div to your lightbox
[03:03:41] <Whirl3d> HardFu, what do you mean? That is all supposed to be html5. So isn't it already normal divs
[03:03:51] <Xotix> Ajax cross domain image upload possible in ie? which browser would make problems?
[03:03:58] <Xotix> *browsers
[03:04:06] <HardFu> Whirl3d: http://www.ifo.dk/
[03:04:13] <Whirl3d> greg_f. try closest
[03:04:37] <HardFu> I'm trying to achieve something similar without flash
[03:05:04] <Whirl3d> var d=$("#id_type_0).closest(".control-group") will search through it's ancestors to find the first control-group class
[03:06:32] <Whirl3d> but HardFu, that first site doesn't have flash on it. It's all CSS3 transforms/transitions and html5
[03:07:05] <HardFu> I know
[03:07:16] <HardFu> www.ifo.dk is my customer's site
[03:07:49] <HardFu> it has flash
[03:07:57] <HardFu> now the want iPad version
[03:08:00] <HardFu> with the same look/feel
[03:08:21] <HardFu> not pixel perfect, but as close as possible
[03:08:26] <greg_f> Whirl3d: thanks a lot!
[03:08:38] <Whirl3d> greg_f, np.
[03:08:42] <HardFu> so I need to use some CSS3/jquery goodness to get the swiping effect
[03:08:50] <HardFu> swiping = page flip
[03:09:22] <thereDontGo> Hey i just made a dead simple jquery plugin that transfers <select> into a customizable HTML select list with Images + text, anyone interested to check it out on github?
[03:09:35] <Whirl3d> you wil have to use the 3D transform transitions in CSS3. It should be pretty simple actually.
[03:09:39] <k1ng> how do i use an onresize function jquery dialog?
[03:10:38] <Whirl3d> thereDontGo, I'll check it out in a little while if you post a link. Sounds cool.
[03:11:13] <thereDontGo> sure
[03:11:15] <thereDontGo> https://github.com/ramigb/smartMenu
[03:13:39] <Whirl3d> HardFu, here is a website that shows how to do the first part of the pagefold you are looking for: http://blog.persistent.info/2010/08/replicating-flipboards-page-fold.html
[03:14:11] <qvarkk> i cant find any information on how to either iterate through an JS object _or_ convert json to an array instead of object with $.parseJSON
[03:14:13] <qvarkk> Can someone help me?
[03:14:25] <qvarkk> the problem is that i dont know the object key i get back
[03:14:32] <HardFu> Whirl3d: thanx I'll check it out
[03:14:45] <HardFu> I don't need the 3 parts, 2 will suffice (like a book)
[03:14:51] <dr0id> what is the syntax highlighter of your choice ?
[03:15:08] <granden> Whirl3d: Yeah, I think that is it. Not stopping but contiuneing to slide for a little while.
[03:15:26] <granden> Momentum of some kind it is.
[03:15:33] <Whirl3d> granden, look up "easing" with your slider.
[03:15:45] <Whirl3d> You want it to ease into position.
[03:16:01] <granden> Whirl3d: Ok, but dont have any slider or such
[03:16:05] <granden> just a div with a fixed size
[03:16:14] <xec> qvarkk: the JSON spec includes both arrays and objects... so it doesnt make too much sense to ask how to convert it to an array instead of an object
[03:16:14] <granden> and to much info to be displayed on one page
[03:16:17] <Whirl3d> Then you may have to handle it yourself.
[03:16:44] <granden> Hmm
[03:16:45] <xec> qvarkk: if you want to iterate, you can look at $.each() in either case
[03:16:53] <qvarkk> ok
[03:17:12] <Whirl3d> You could handle the scroll event to detect the rate of scrolling and then when the scroll event stops (onmouseup), yo you could programmatically continue to scroll until rate=0;
[03:19:00] <Whirl3d> actually, you'd be better off to manually manage the entire scroll event. I'd look for a plugin that does scrolling and easing. Karl Svedberg has a "smoothScroll" plugin that might have some insight for you.
[03:19:03] * W1r3 says hi
[03:19:38] <granden> Whirl3d: Ok, thanks
[03:20:16] <W1r3> does anyone know a good plugin for domain checking?
[03:20:37] <granden> Whirl3d: Did  a bit of googling my self, found something called iScroll
[03:20:40] <granden> seams to do the trick as well
[03:21:07] <Whirl3d> good to know. I'll look it up for future reference.
[03:22:04] <Flo0815> What is the correct syntax to append a div like $('<div/>', {id: 'someid'});
[03:22:27] <Flo0815> do i need to store this in a var and then var.appendTo('target'); ?
[03:22:51] <Whirl3d> no, you can just appendTo from that same line.
[03:23:15] <Flo0815>  $('<div/>', {class: "feature " + config.type, html: config.content}).appendTo('#' . elId);
[03:23:18] <Whirl3d> $("<div>",{id:"something"}).appendTo("someting");
[03:23:19] <Flo0815> this doesnt wrok
[03:23:42] <Whirl3d> "#".ellld doesn't make any sense
[03:23:50] <Flo0815> oh, php...
[03:23:54] <Whirl3d> "#"+elid, does
[03:24:05] <Flo0815> ah shit...
[03:24:07] <Flo0815> thanks
[03:24:11] <Whirl3d> np
[03:24:12] <Flo0815> i need a break...
[03:26:31] <ravenzz> can someone help me with this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10410079/jquery-val-duplicates-multiple-select-values ?
[03:28:27] <Whirl3d> thereDontGo, the plugin doesn't work for me. I think it's a css thing though.
[03:28:31] <velocitykendal> Anyone ever used Flexslider?
[03:28:31] <velocitykendal> http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[03:28:51] <velocitykendal> I'm trying to create my own Play/Pause button but struggling a bit
[03:29:44] <mason9> im having trouble refreshing a jquery masonry on my wordpress page. the facebook comments take time to load and changes the sizes of my boxes, and i can't for the life of me make the refresh work.  how can i make masonry refresh? thanks for any help!
[03:30:33] <velocitykendal> There's a callback API with slider.pause() and slider.resume() but I'm having difficulty constructing this into some jQuery that works
[03:34:32] <Whirl3d> velocitykendal, I'm not familiar with that plugin, but traditionally, plugins operate by passing methods as strings to them. So $(".flexslider").flexslider("stop") would stop the slide show.
[03:35:19] <Whirl3d> This may be different, I don't know. But try passing the "start" and "pause" methods as simple strings in the constructor.
[03:36:04] <CameronM> On the jquery docs page for the load event, it says that it can fail to fire if the image is in the browsers cache. Does this apply to when the load event is bound before the image elemtn
[03:36:12] <CameronM> Element is created *
[03:36:24] <Whirl3d> yes
[03:37:28] <CameronM> Oh wait thats not possible. I mean the load event is bound to an image, then the src is changed.
[03:38:23] <Whirl3d> I usually load images like this: var image=new Image(), img=$(image), img.load(handler).attr('src":url); if image.complete) {img.trigger("load"););
[03:38:59] <Whirl3d> that ensures that the load handler is fired even if the image is cached in I.E.
[03:40:53] <thereDontGo> Whirl3d, what OS + browser did you check it with please?
[03:41:03] <velocitykendal> Whirl3d: thanks for the input. passing "stop" or "pause" as a string doesn't work unfortunately
[03:41:49] <Whirl3d> I was just reading the advanced api for it and it looks like they are returning an object literal with methods attached. So you can do slider.stop() for example)
[03:42:12] <CameronM> So in the offending cases, the image is loaded atomically?
[03:42:17] <mtgtnt> Cork: you here?
[03:42:17] <Whirl3d> Chrome (latest) and Win7 64u
[03:42:33] <velocitykendal> Whirl3d: How would that look in a line of jQuery?
[03:43:00] <velocitykendal> did you see the 'slider.pause()' function listed?
[03:43:42] <thereDontGo> Whirl3d, i have the same setup, that's weird, you have any idea what's going wrong?
[03:43:47] <Whirl3d> var slider=$("someElement").flexSlider(opts); $("element").on("click", function (e) {slider.stop();});
[03:44:25] <Whirl3d> thereDon'tGo, haven't looked behind the scenese yet. I have a really big monitor, so mabye that's the issue?
[03:45:01] <Whirl3d> it says: style top:845px;
[03:45:26] <Whirl3d> so wherever you are setting up the top of your menu, double check it.
[03:45:42] <thereDontGo> Whirl3d, yeah i think it's a problem with positioning, this is one of my very first jquery plugins, and i felt so happy to upload it and share it
[03:45:49] <elegos> hello! Is there a way in jQuery to "deselect" a flash object? Mine uses the scroll, so I'd like to deselect it on $("#myflashobject").mouseout using the .blur() method, but it seems not to work...
[03:46:02] <thereDontGo> Whirl3d, thank you very much anyways, i will make sure to fix it
[03:46:19] <elegos> live demo of my problem: http://gear-makeup.elegosproject.org/?page=view&set=5ki4Ce9wE7fD42b0Rg6tg3QA1WM42R
[03:46:20] <Whirl3d> thereDontGo, I think it will be great when you get these minor kinks worked out. Don't give up
[03:46:24] <Whirl3d> it's a great idea.
[03:47:14] <Whirl3d> elegos, can you try applying focus to another element?
[03:47:20] <Whirl3d> rather than blurring?
[03:47:30] <elegos> can I focus a static div?
[03:47:43] <thereDontGo> Whirl3d, thank you :) sure
[03:47:45] <Whirl3d> I'm not sure. Maybe if it has a tabIndex
[03:48:04] <elegos> gonna focus an input textr
[03:49:12] <JTallis> $(".sendButton").delay(80000).removeAttr("disabled"); < the delay doesn't happen on this.
[03:49:19] <elegos> Whirl3d: no, not working...
[03:49:26] <elegos> (see previous link)
[03:50:11] <Whirl3d> ITallis, the delay() method I believe only works for the fx queue. I'll doublecheck, but you might want to lookup "delay" in the jquery API
[03:51:17] <JTallis> That's probably it then...
[03:51:37] <Whirl3d> ITallis, double check though in case I am wrong.
[03:51:42] <JTallis> basically I have an ajax call, I disable the button before it, and i want to re-enable it 2 seconds after the ajax call has completed.
[03:52:02] <Whirl3d> elegos, you want to be able to scroll what?
[03:52:50] <Whirl3d> so use setTimeout in your callback handler for the ajax
[03:53:04] <JTallis> i suppose that will work
[03:53:30] <Whirl3d> $.ajax(url, {dataType:'html', success:function () {var t=setTimeout(reenable, 2000);}});
[03:54:35] <elegos> Whirl3d: if I click on the model viewer, using the scroll will zoom the model
[03:54:47] <elegos> but it will also scroll the page
[03:55:15] <elegos> I'd like to divide the two things: in the object: scroll model, out the object: scroll page
[03:55:32] <Whirl3d> that's not my experience on the site.
[03:55:33] <elegos> if I click out, the model won't zoom
[03:55:40] <Whirl3d> they work the way you would expect
[03:55:48] <elegos> which browser?
[03:55:59] <Whirl3d> I can rotate the image without scrolling or scroll the page (without rotating);
[03:56:09] <Whirl3d> Chrome (latest) win764u
[03:56:17] <elegos> me too <.<
[03:56:26] <JTallis> A form can still be submitted with the enter key, even when submit is disabled.. i want to disable submition of the form aswell, how can I do this?
[03:56:52] <Whirl3d> handle the submit event for the form.
[03:57:23] <elegos> Whirl3d: refresh the page and without clicking, roll over the flash object: you shouldn't be able to zoom the model, though you should be able to scroll the page
[03:57:32] <JTallis> oh yeah, and check if the submit button is disabled, and if so ... ignore the submition.
[03:58:15] <Xotix> Ajax cross domain image upload possible in ie? which browser would make problems?
[03:58:22] <Whirl3d> elegos, the model never zooms for me?
[03:58:29] <elegos> that's correct
[03:58:38] <elegos> now, click on the model and scroll
[03:58:59] <Whirl3d> you mean with the mousewheel
[03:59:02] <elegos> yes
[03:59:16] <Whirl3d> you need to manage the mousewheel scroll event.
[03:59:32] <Whirl3d> THere's a mousewheel plugin. I'd look into that.
[03:59:50] <elegos> but if I click on the model viewer, I'll "enable" it. I'd like to disable it when I rollout
[04:00:12] <elegos> (with the mousewheel plugin preventing scrolling the page when the mouse is over the model)
[04:01:04] <Whirl3d> That's what I would do. There may be a better solution, but until I found it, I would manually handle the mousewheel event, preventing it from doing anything if moused over the artwork
[04:02:05] <elegos> that's the idea for the web scrolling, but it's partial: out of the model viewer, it will work properly for the website, but it will continue zooming in and out the model
[04:02:09] <elegos> until you click out
[04:02:50] <JTallis> if ($("#chatMessage").val() != "" && !$(".sendButton").hasAttr("disabled"))
[04:02:58] <JTallis> Object [object Object] has no method 'hasAttr'
[04:03:34] <Whirl3d> ? .hasAttr
[04:03:39] <bot-t1> Whirl3d, .hasAttr([ element ]) - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 11 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9396
[04:04:05] <Whirl3d> nvm, I didn't mean for that to come up. LOL
[04:04:14] <Whirl3d> try this:
[04:04:30] <Whirl3d> $(".sendButton:disabled").length?
[04:04:55] <Whirl3d> or $(".sendButton").is(":disabled");
[04:04:57] <JTallis> Yeah I just looked and it doesn't exist.. must of been getting mixed up between hasClass and hasAttr
[04:05:17] <Whirl3d> or $(".sendButton").attr("disabled")!==undefined;
[04:05:58] <JTallis> && !$(".sendButton").is(":disabled")) that works. :D
[04:07:20] <Whirl3d> elegos, I'm not sure how the mouse-wheel scroll event is propogated, so I don't know for sure how to stop the flash object from receiveing it.
[04:08:12] <Whirl3d> elegos, maybe you could load the model into an iframe or something?
[04:09:06] <Whirl3d> in fact, I think that might work. Then you would only scroll when moused over (or focused) on the iframe
[04:09:30] <Whirl3d> *scroll, I mean scale the model/affect the model
[04:19:06] <Ricaz> How do I select elements that doesn't contain specific classes?
[04:19:44] <Whirl3d> .not()?
[04:19:53] <Whirl3d> or .filter()?
[04:20:56] <Ricaz> :s
[04:21:09] <Ricaz> so $('.product').not('.otherClass')
[04:21:27] <Whirl3d> will select all products that do not have .otherClass
[04:21:40] <Ricaz> oh
[04:26:22] <Ricaz> doesn't really work
[04:26:50] <Whirl3d> ? demo @ Ricaz
[04:26:51] <bot-t1> Ricaz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:27:14] <Ricaz> I'll try
[04:30:25] <Whirl3d> can I add data to the window data object? $(window).data("lasthash", location.hash);
[04:31:12] <Ricaz> wtf? why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/WxDwk/
[04:31:56] <Whirl3d> did you select jquery framework on the left?
[04:33:22] <Ricaz> oooh
[04:36:55] <Ricaz> Okay here it is http://jsfiddle.net/WxDwk/2/
[04:37:14] <Ricaz> so what I want it to do
[04:37:27] <Ricaz> Is not hide fruits when you click it, if fruits are alreay shown
[04:37:37] <Xotix> are there any problems to expect with ie when doing a cross domain ajax file upload
[04:37:37] <Whirl3d> ricaz, you need to enclose your ids in "
[04:37:51] <Whirl3d> and you need to look at the dev console to find errors.
[04:38:03] <Ricaz> what
[04:38:06] <Ricaz> there are no errors
[04:38:29] <Ricaz> and enclosing them in '' in html makes no difference
[04:38:49] <Whirl3d> then what is the issue if there's no problem?
[04:38:52] <Ricaz> But here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/WxDwk/3/
[04:39:33] <Whirl3d> so, what's the problem?
[04:39:55] <Ricaz> Not hide fruits when you click it, if fruits are alreay shown
[04:40:06] <Ricaz> i want it to~
[04:40:59] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/WxDwk/5/
[04:41:40] <Ricaz> Wow that is exactly what I did before, but without the '.'
[04:41:50] <Ricaz> thank you
[04:42:33] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/WxDwk/6/
[04:43:30] <Whirl3d> np. I wasn't aware that you didn't need quotes around id attributes in html, so thank you. LOL
[04:45:05] <Ricaz> Well it's probably w3c standard to do so
[04:46:26] <nFFF> in html5 you ommit qoutes
[04:46:29] <nFFF> can*
[04:46:44] <mertin> hi, anyone using impromptu?
[04:47:00] <mertin> I tried to call 'prompt' from inside a function, and I get
[04:47:04] <mertin> 'prompt is not a function'
[04:48:05] <mertin> I mean, impromptu works fine, but when I call 'prompt' from inside a function, instead of the global script space, it doesn't work
[04:48:09] <Ricaz> speaking of html5, do you need to define "IM USING HTML5 ON THIS PAGE" anywhere? cus I never did
[04:49:07] <shoky> <!doctype html>
[04:49:54] <Cork> Ricaz: if you don't specify a doctype your getting a compatibility mode
[04:49:58] <Cork> and you don't want that
[04:50:23] <dns-away> hi, i have <span id="1335959313"></span> and function unload to convert span id (timestamp) to correct time in span.text(''), and work correctly,but on append no work :/ How i can solve it ? :-)
[04:50:23] <dns-away> Thanks, Regards
[04:50:39] <dns-away> unload = onLoad*
[04:50:52] <Cork> dns-away: you shouldn't use id for timestamps
[04:50:57] <Cork> use data-time or something
[04:51:10] <jeffsmykil> anyone familiar with the bootstrap popovers?
[04:51:19] <pachet> what Cork said
[04:51:27] <pachet> technically that's an invalid id per html4 spec
[04:51:36] <dns-away> Why Cork, What is the problem when i have timestamp on ID ? :-)
[04:52:01] <Cork> dns-away: 1. its not meant for it, 2. the id is indexed and stored in a database by the browser
[04:52:08] <pachet> dns-away: from the spec : ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z])
[04:52:09] <Cork> so you get a completly uneeded overhead
[04:52:23] <Cork> and ya, just numbers isn't valid in id's
[04:52:35] <shoky> any other attributes indexed automatically?
[04:52:45] <Cork> name on forms
[04:52:45] <dns-away> Uhm.
[04:52:47] <jeffsmykil> im guilty of that one
[04:52:49] <Cork> classes
[04:52:57] <Cork> and a few more
[04:53:28] <shoky> i never thought of the indexing aspect of some attributes. time to research. thanks!
[04:54:02] <dns-away> Okay
[04:54:13] <dns-away> I using already timestamp on span text
[04:55:11] <Cork> dns-away, shoky: and from html5 data-* attributes has been reserved for custom data
[04:55:16] <Cork> so they'r actually meant for it
[04:55:27] <Cork> thats why its a better idea to use that prefix
[04:55:37] <shoky> yeah im sure i haven't been abusing indexed attributes, but still good to be aware of it
[04:56:08] <Cork> shoky: what i meant is, if its not a defined attribute, it should have data- infront of it
[04:56:13] <jeffsmykil> wait so why cant i start id's with  a number?
[04:56:19] <dns-away> i have <span Class="TimeStampToTime">1335959313</span> And onLoad page it work, but when i should to append new span with new timestamp, function for convert not work correctly ? :-) How i can solve it ? :-)
[04:56:24] <shoky> cork what i meant is: im aware :) thanks
[04:56:26] <Cork> jeffsmykil: its invalid according to the spec
[04:56:35] <pachet> *according to the html4 spec, to be clear
[04:56:38] <jeffsmykil> yes but is there a reason for it
[04:56:42] <pachet> it's valid in html5 working draft
[04:57:00] <jeffsmykil> that seems like a dumb reason not to do something unless there is a reason not to
[04:57:55] <Cork> jeffsmykil: my memory is failing be a bit, but i think ie had some wierd document. way to access id's back in the 90's
[04:58:06] <ravenzz> is it possible to animate toggling the height value but avoiding display:none ?
[04:58:17] <jeffsmykil> Cork ah ok
[04:58:21] <Cork> ravenzz: use .animate
[04:58:25] <shoky> you heard it here first: unless there is a reason, its a dumb reason!
[04:58:33] <Cork> :)
[04:58:44] <jeffsmykil> shoky: do you always do things because you are told?
[04:58:52] <shoky> jeffsmykil: never
[04:59:01] <ravenzz> Corey .animate({ height: 'toggle'}, 300) set the elements display property to none when it reaches the 0px
[04:59:03] <ravenzz> Cork ^
[04:59:04] <jeffsmykil> well then you agree with me
[04:59:18] <shoky> i was just making fun of your phrasing, sir
[04:59:37] <shoky> my sincerest apolly-loggies
[04:59:43] <shoky> o brother.
[05:00:20] <jeffsmykil> no worries
[05:00:22] <Cork> ravenzz: i don't think you can use 'toggle'
[05:00:28] <Cork> not sure thought
[05:00:31] * Cork checks
[05:00:57] <pachet> jeffsmykil: there is usually a very good reason for most things in the programming ecosystem
[05:01:00] <jeffsmykil> I have to style an ASP control later today, I am not looking forward to this
[05:01:16] <pachet> i dont know about you, but i dont know of many spec writers who just do things for the hell of it
[05:01:16] <Cork> ravenzz: yup toggle does the same thing as .show/.hide
[05:01:19] <Flo0815> hey, i want to slideDown 3 divs, but not simultaneously. If the first one is done, it should wait one second, then slide Down the next and so one. Any help?
[05:01:20] <jeffsmykil> pachet: but in this case it seems to be that IE 4 doesn't support it
[05:01:24] <seablade_> newcomer question to jQuery and Javascript: I am trying to embed JWPlayer into a website (Drupalgardens) but am having problems getting it to populate the playlist.  I am trying to populate it from an UL on the webpage of links, I have the code to render those links as <audio> tags working, and have been able to embed a jwplayer single player for them, but can't get it to populate a playlist and wanted to see if anyone had
[05:01:24] <seablade_>  any ideas.  The code is located at http://jsfiddle.net/dYXHr/ and I am just running it in a firefox scratchpad for the moment, but will be attached to a div on the page.  The test page I am using is http://seablade.drupalgardens.com/.  You will see the list of audio tracks a bit farther down the page there.  Thanks for any help.
[05:01:34] <pachet> jeffsmykil: that's not entirely true
[05:01:49] <seablade_> I suspect the problem comes from proper formatting of the JQuery for the JWPlayer js to build the playlist, but again am not sure
[05:01:59] <pachet> jeffsmykil: when they were drafting the 4 spec, the browserscape was very 1990's
[05:02:12] <pachet> nevertheless, like today, most major browsers were implemented in c++
[05:02:27] <pachet> in c++, there's a very immediate reason for not prefacing an identifier with a number
[05:02:48] <pachet> because if the following character is a letter, you have a numeric constant with a type
[05:03:00] <ravenzz> Cork yes... how clean is to use an if then? :\
[05:03:00] <pachet> so its basically a way to speed up the lex parsing
[05:03:17] <seablade_> Sadly I don't have direct access to the server in this instance, so have to do everything via javascript/jQuery that I can embed in the page
[05:03:20] <pachet> nowadays, it's not really an issue because the compilation is so abstracted
[05:03:44] <jeffsmykil> pachet: fair enough
[05:03:48] <Cork> ravenzz: use .toggle and animate
[05:04:02] <jeffsmykil> unfortunately xhtml has no data tag, so I'm probably going to keep doing it :/
[05:04:37] <Cork> jeffsmykil: xhtml5 does
[05:05:11] <jeffsmykil> Cork: /me shrugs
[05:05:29] <Cork> xhtml is moved in line with what html5 did, but with the lesser compatibility modes
[05:05:31] <jeffsmykil> Cork ever used the twitter bootstrap popiovers??
[05:05:40] <Cork> nope
[05:05:51] <Cork> never had to interact with twitter as a developer
[05:06:07] <jeffsmykil> yeah this isn't interacting with the service
[05:06:18] <jeffsmykil> this is their open source web dev stuff
[05:06:19] <Cork> ok?
[05:06:23] <Cork> ah
[05:06:30] <Cork> nope never used it
[05:06:38] <jeffsmykil> you should check it out quite useful
[05:06:58] * Cork takes a note
[05:07:00] <jeffsmykil> Cork:  http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[05:07:17] <Cork> thx
[05:07:37] <jeffsmykil> documentation isn't great though imo
[05:07:56] <jeffsmykil> but if you can get it working at least you know it's going to work
[05:08:15] <webguynow> for jQuery if jsonp is used in an ajax call, with no 'callback' but a 'success' fx defined, is that what is used as a callback ?
[05:08:55] <Cork> webguynow: fx?
[05:09:04] <jeffsmykil> function
[05:09:10] <Cork> ah
[05:09:11] <Cork> no
[05:09:29] <Cork> webguynow: the callback function is needed else jquery can't get the data from the jsonp
[05:09:46] <Cork> it needs to get a function from the server to execute to get the data
[05:10:26] <Cork> webguynow: if you don't give one manually jquery will set one it self
[05:10:40] <Cork> a jQuery<number> if i remember correctly
[05:10:49] <webguynow> I've seen that yes ( jQuery supplies it )
[05:11:07] <Cork> the server needs to define that function in the js it returns
[05:11:45] <webguynow> the goofy thing is, on this project I joined, team is using jsonp on same domain that server side app is running -
[05:12:04] <Cork> thats a really bad idea
[05:12:12] * jeffsmykil also thinks that is goofy
[05:12:12] <Cork> unless you need to support cross domain calls
[05:12:14] <webguynow> I'm guessing jsonp is not really needed.  Why they did it that way, I'm not sure
[05:12:19] <ravenzz> Cork I basically need a slideToggle which doesn't hide the element
[05:12:54] <dns-away> Cork, It's My problem, after append, updates not work :/ - http://jsfiddle.net/hydDZ/6/
[05:13:31] <webguynow> so - you nay-sayers that commented ( and I'm in your camp )
[05:13:35] <Cork> ravenzz: ya i get what your after, but the default functions all hide the element
[05:14:05] <Cork> webguynow: well its not really a problem when its from the same domain
[05:14:16] <webguynow> what's the issues with using jsonp on same domain ?  ( I can possibly get them to change direction on this )
[05:14:39] <jeffsmykil> its like using a hovercraft when you only ever drive on land
[05:14:44] <Cork> webguynow: cause if they can insert malicus code in your jsonp they could just have added it in your js files
[05:15:17] <Cork> webguynow: when jsonp becomes a bit scary is when its used cross domain, cause if domain 2 is hacked you will pull and execute it
[05:15:47] <Cork> compared to if it was pure jsonp it wouldn't allow executable code
[05:15:51] <Cork> sorry
[05:15:54] <Cork> pure json
[05:16:34] <Cork> dns-away: you need to use delegated listners if you want to catch elements added after the element
[05:17:40] <Cork> dns-away: http://jsfiddle.net/hydDZ/7/
[05:18:50] <dns-away> Thank You - Cork -)
[05:20:28] <nFFF> jeffsmykil, any experience with the responsive design from bootstrap
[05:20:31] <nFFF> just checked their docs
[05:20:41] <jeffsmykil> nFFF zero, sorry
[05:21:14] <jeffsmykil> nFFF I'm struggling with popover placement and killing ajax requests on mouse out right now
[05:21:55] <nFFF> responsive design has to be the future
[05:22:08] <nFFF> as a base design
[05:25:34] <mertin> impromptu functcion called inside a javascript funcion, is not working.... otherwise works well..... what could be wrong?
[05:25:56] <jeffsmykil> nFFF: honestly i have to read more about the term
[05:27:04] <nFFF> it means your page readjusts the css depending on the viewport of the screen
[05:27:11] <nFFF> so its adaptive to the screen size
[05:27:16] <jeffsmykil> oh ok
[05:27:27] <jeffsmykil> yeah this project im working on could have used that for sure
[05:27:40] <nFFF> it just means it displays the best possible way on large monitors, normal size, tablets and smart phones
[05:27:58] <jeffsmykil> so 1 website multiple styles using meta tags
[05:27:59] <nFFF> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ resize this window all the way down to tiny
[05:28:06] <nFFF> and watch how the content readjusts
[05:28:19] <nFFF> yea basically
[05:28:24] <jeffsmykil> yeah that's super hot
[05:28:47] <jeffsmykil> i have a personal project i should incorporate that into
[05:30:56] <mertin> anyone?
[05:31:10] <jeffsmykil> nFFF: I just started using LESS so much to learn about everything
[05:31:10] <webguynow>  Is there any Really good way (besides SSL) to secure json based web services ?
[05:31:37] <Flo0815> hey is it possible to preload a video using JQ ajax?
[05:33:02] <LukeNukem_> man im pissed ._.
[05:44:29] <nFFF> LESS jeffsmykil?
[05:45:07] <nFFF> Flo0815 I think you can do it with html5
[05:46:18] <u-> hi. is there workaround for setting scrollLeft property for hidden element? regular $.scrollLeft(N) does not work on hidden elements...
[05:47:36] <bittyx-work> hi all. i have some tabular data in my webpage (actual proper use of <table> elements), and i'd like to be able to nicely copy/paste it to work/excel. now, when i select the table contents with my mouse, do CTRL+C, and paste it into word/excel, i just get a single string, instead of a table. however, if i do CTRL+A on my page, and then copy and paste to word/excel, i get the whole page, including the properly formatted table
[05:48:05] <bittyx-work> now what i'd like is some way to add a "copy table to clipboard" button on my page, and when you click it, it would copy the whole html table, so it could be nicely pasted to excel
[05:48:34] <bittyx-work> anyone have any ideas about a jquery plugin for that? ideally, i'd like something like $('table#invoice').copyToClipboard()
[05:49:42] <jeffsmykil> nFFF: yeah you can im just naming other techs i want tolearn
[05:51:42] <bittyx-work> my research shows that actual clipboard manipulation is complicated and has a bunch of potential security issues - if anyone has any better ideas, i'm still open to suggestions
[05:58:48] <dns-away> Cork, can you check it http://jsfiddle.net/hydDZ/10/
[06:01:52] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/hydDZ/12/

[06:02:23] <chaoflow> $('<ul class="foo"/>').html('<li class="bar"/>').find('.foo .bar') -> [] -- am I wrong or jquery?
[06:03:42] <chaoflow> $('<ul class="foo"/>').html('<li class="bar"/>').find('.bar') -> [<li class="bar"></li>] -- this one works
[06:03:54] <Zhy> If I'm not mistaken the find searches in children
[06:04:35] <Zhy> foo class is the element on which you call find, and the find searches the c hildren of said element - but there's only the bar child :)
[06:05:14] <chaoflow> Zhy: $('<ul class="foo"/>').html('<li class="bar"/>').find('.bar:parent(.foo)') - this also returns []
[06:05:15] <Zhy> if you did .parent().find('.foo .bar') it would work, just to exemplify what I mean
[06:05:37] <chaoflow> hmm
[06:05:45] <Zhy> hmm I'm not familiar with appending :parent
[06:06:06] <Zhy> http://api.jquery.com/find/
[06:06:34] <chaoflow> Zhy: $('<ul class="foo"/>').html('<li class="bar"/>').parent().find('.foo .bar') -- also []
[06:06:35] <Zhy> in any case it's searching the descendants, not including itself
[06:06:48] <Zhy> humm
[06:06:58] <chaoflow> ok - well my last example, it probably does not have a parent
[06:07:04] <Zhy> xD
[06:07:13] <Zhy> Well you would need a parent for it to work ;D
[06:07:44] <Zhy> or do closest('.foo').find('.bar')
[06:07:52] <Zhy> closest includes the element on which it is called
[06:08:11] <Zhy> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:08:31] <Zhy> or just closest('.foo .bar'); maybe
[06:08:48] <granden> .map is really nice, but is there any foreach loop in jquery or should I just write normal javascript?
[06:11:49] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm trying to use the .on command to delegate dynamic content to an event. I'm having problems understanding jQuery's documentation on it. Could anybody give me a hand understanding how to accomplish this?
[06:12:35] <elegos> I've loaded the Mousewheel plugin, created an iframe and created a (hidden) div with tabindex 100. I want to prevent the iframe's flash video from catching the mousewheel action when scrolling the body (i.e. outside the iframe). How can I do that? I can biond the mousewheel event on the iframe and preventing the default, but I can't do the same from body to iframe
[06:13:18] <elegos> DeltaHeavy: $("your selector").on("click", fn)
[06:13:32] <elegos> where fn is a generic function
[06:13:42] <elegos> and "click" is the event
[06:15:24] <becom33> looking to do somthing like this http://homepage.mac.com/bradster/iarchitect/images/list2.gif . but should be able to do multiple selections
[06:15:26] <becom33> help please
[06:16:01] <elegos> becom33: SELECT html tag with "multiple" attribute
[06:16:57] <xec> chaoflow: find() will only look at contents (i.e. not look at the top level element)
[06:17:31] <becom33> elegos, I dont get you
[06:17:41] <xec> chaoflow: sorry if you already got an answer, my irc client was scrolled up a bit
[06:17:42] <elegos> you want a multiple selection, right?
[06:19:12] <elegos> becom33: http://jsfiddle.net/buZKf/
[06:19:29] <chaoflow> Zhy, xec: Is there a way to express it as a selector?
[06:21:04] <xec> chaoflow: i'm not sure i follow. are you creating elements or selecting
[06:21:09] <DeltaHeavy> elegos: Thanks, still can't get it to work but I'm going to try at it a bit more
[06:21:17] <elegos> which event is fired when I click anywhere on the web page?
[06:21:33] <elegos> and secondly: can I manually fire it on another event?
[06:22:14] <DeltaHeavy> elegos: Was that directed at me?
[06:22:35] <xec> elegos: um, the click event? bound to root? of course, if could be intercepted, if some click handler prevents bubbling
[06:22:39] <elegos> DeltaHeavy: only when I replied to you 5 minutes ago
[06:23:05] <elegos> xec: I have to click away from a flash video (in an iframe) to prevent interaction with it
[06:23:12] <chaoflow> xec: I inject content which then needs to be initialised, i.e. searching for ".expandable .folder" (.foo .bar) and all .folder that have a .expandable parent need to be processed
[06:23:29] <elegos> xec: and I'd like to do it automatically when I roll out the iframe
[06:23:48] <elegos> xec: I tried to focus on a hidden div, but it won't work
[06:23:54] <chaoflow> and so far I have a markup_trigger ".expandable .folder", I'd like to avoid a two-stage trigger
[06:24:13] <becom33> elegos, well yea but I need a textbox to filter . coz I have huge list of employyes I wanna select
[06:24:16] <xec> ?demo @ chaoflow
[06:24:17] <bot-t> chaoflow, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:24:30] <jeffsmykil> is there a more efficient way to do this?  http://pastebin.com/fNeRPhAw
[06:24:42] <xec> elegos: "roll out"? you could  look at the blur event perhaps
[06:24:46] <mertin> Hi, I'm using impromptu, and I can't call the 'prompt' function from inside a callback function, is that normal?
[06:24:49] <DeltaHeavy> elegos: I'm using that exact syntax. I have a function that draws a bunch of divs depending on ~50 different selections, each drawing up to 9 divs (id=panel0 - panel-8) all belong to a certain class. How can I make a click event for these? Am I just getting something wrong?
[06:25:04] <DeltaHeavy> $('.door_style, .door_style_notb, .door_style_notop').on('click', function() {
[06:25:05] <elegos> becom: $("#myFilter").change(function () { $("#myselector".filter(...) } )
[06:25:35] <chaoflow> xec: https://github.com/cornae/Patterns/blob/master/src/patterns/expandable.js - I want to rewrite this so only folders are passed in, not the .expandable
[06:25:38] <elegos> xec: http://gear-makeup.elegosproject.org/?page=view&set=5ki4Ce9wE7fD42b0Rg6tg3QA1WM42R (js: http://gear-makeup.elegosproject.org/js/model_viewer.js )
[06:25:55] <chaoflow> xec: also: https://github.com/cornae/Patterns/blob/master/src/patterns.js#L57
[06:26:04] <mertin> Hi, I'm using impromptu, and I can't call the 'prompt' function from inside a callback function, is that normal?
[06:26:05] <becom33> elegos, thats confusing . div's name is blah right ?
[06:26:15] <elegos> wait a second
[06:26:23] <becom33> elegos, :) sorry ok ok
[06:26:31] <chaoflow> xec: it works like it is there, but it does not work if a ul.expandable exists and li.folder are injected into it
[06:28:49] <xec> chaoflow: i'm sorry, i don't have time to sift through a lot of code and try to guess what it does, maybe someone else will take a look or you can make a simplified demo (or pseudocode) of what you're trying to do?
[06:30:06] <FF76> hi, can anyone point me to a page describing how the (result) parameter gets passed?
[06:30:26] <xec> FF76: in what context?
[06:30:30] <chaoflow> xec: understandable - let me see
[06:30:57] <FF76> xec: am i allowed to paste URLs here?
[06:31:04] <xec> go for it
[06:31:09] <FF76> xec: http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_ajax_ajax_async
[06:31:11] <mertin> anyone can help me?
[06:31:40] <FF76> xec:  seems like the result parameter takes on the url object, but i can't find any documentation describing this behaviour
[06:32:05] <xec> ?$.ajax @ FF76
[06:32:15] <bot-t> FF76, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:33:12] <xec> FF76: look at the success option, it takes a function which is called when the ajax is completed
[06:33:59] <elegos> becom33: something like this (you have to work around it, it's just a fast logic flow): http://jsfiddle.net/buZKf/1/
[06:34:04] <xec> FF76: that function is sent three params, the first of which is basically the data received from the server
[06:34:11] <chaoflow> xec: http://www.pastie.org/3848758
[06:34:30] <elegos> xec: any idea on how to "click away" from the flash video then?
[06:35:12] <xec> elegos: is the iframe on the same domain as the main page?
[06:35:17] <becom33> umm elegos does text box works fine ?
[06:36:00] <FF76> xec: yes, but where does it say that result is interchangeably used with url?
[06:36:34] <FF76> xec: or is that just common knowledge?
[06:36:36] <xec> FF76: i don't understand that question - result is not a url?
[06:37:14] <chaoflow> xec: and updated a bit: http://pastie.org/3848767
[06:37:15] <FF76> xec: result is a parameter that gets passed to the anonymous function in success:
[06:37:33] <FF76> xec: from the example, it's clear that result takes on the url parameter somehow
[06:38:00] <FF76> xec: i'd like to know where i can find more information about the result parameter, as it has not been previously declared
[06:38:07] <Zhy> ah sorry chaoflow, I was gone for a bit... what's the status, still some issues?
[06:38:30] <elegos> xec: yes, the iframe is on the same domain
[06:39:00] <xec> FF76: it doesn't need to be named "result" you can call it what you want... "data" is commonly used, but it doesn't have anything to do with the url option
[06:39:04] <chaoflow> Zhy: http://pastie.org/3848767 - still this - but currently investigating whether I can use a parent() somewhere in there
[06:39:43] <xec> FF76: the function is executed internally by jQuery and passed three parameters
[06:40:06] <chaoflow> hmm - no - with parent I would scan too muc, beautiful would be a selector in combination with a traversal function
[06:40:33] <elegos> becom33: better (still non-functioning): http://jsfiddle.net/buZKf/3/
[06:40:41] <xec> elegos: i'm not 100% sure about this, but my idea was you might be able to find the iframe's document object and listen to blur on that
[06:41:06] <elegos> xec: embed and object can't handle events
[06:41:56] <xec> elegos: i don't follow
[06:42:20] <xec> elegos: maybe i misunderstood your entire question
[06:42:25] <elegos> xec: you can't blur, focus or unfocus OBJECTs or EMBEDs
[06:42:39] <chaoflow> xec, Zhy: I will introduce a two-stage markup trigger, first searching for parent, 2nd for contained element - I'm still curious, whether there is another way, but will solve like that for now
[06:42:44] <aminal> fun problem. when i call getJSON, i get some kind of error thrown (firebug isn't saying what it is) inside the jquery.ajaxTransport method. the line is xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null ); s.hasContent is defined, but from what i can see s.data is not.
[06:42:47] <xec> elegos: but you have an iframe
[06:42:52] <elegos> indeed
[06:42:53] <xec> right?
[06:42:54] <chaoflow> xec, Zhy: thx a lot for your help!
[06:43:04] <elegos> yes, which contains an src to a local page which loads the object
[06:43:15] <xec> well, can't you listen to blur on the iframe document
[06:44:07] <xec> chaoflow: do you have a sample of your markup? preferably alongside some working code in jsfiddle? :)
[06:44:12] <elegos> xec: not working =\ http://gear-makeup.elegosproject.org/?page=view&set=5ki4Ce9wE7fD42b0Rg6tg3QA1WM42R
[06:44:19] <elegos> (js/model_viewer.js)
[06:44:20] <Zhy> chaoflow you're welcome, there's nothing that comes to my mind right now concerning whether there's another way for what you're doing
[06:44:40] <xec> chaoflow: i'm pretty sure there is a better way to do things, but i'd need to understand what you're trying to do better first
[06:44:55] <mertin> Hi, I'm using impromptu, and I can't call the 'prompt' function from inside a callback function, is that normal?
[06:45:12] <FF76> xec: oh, interesting. very interesting... so any undeclared variable will take on the url: parameter as the filename
[06:45:16] <elegos> xec: as you see in the JS file, I tried to stop the propagation too from the body, but it will be ignored by the flash
[06:45:22] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @mertin
[06:45:22] <bot-t> mertin, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[06:45:26] <johnkpaul> it's hard to tell without an example mertin
[06:45:45] <xec> FF76: i'm not sure what you mean by that
[06:46:04] <mertin> familiar with impromptu?
[06:46:17] <xec> FF76: in the example you linked, the url is pointing to a text file
[06:46:29] <elegos> becom33: this will work: http://jsfiddle.net/buZKf/4/
[06:46:38] <xec> FF76: $.ajax() is then going to make a http request to get the contents of that file
[06:46:50] <mertin> johnkpaul: I mean, there's a prompt which behaves depending on the clicked buttons, calling a callback function
[06:46:52] <xec> FF76: when done, it will be passed to the success function
[06:46:59] <elegos> becom33: now you should set display: default on the others
[06:47:04] <mertin> johnkpaul: inside that callback function I want to call another prompt
[06:47:33] <FF76> xec: as long as there is a url : "path to file", the function(foo) will always get passed the url as the parameter if the parameter is undeclared
[06:47:38] <Whirl3d> elegos, did the iframe help or make things worse?
[06:47:44] <elegos> becom33: http://jsfiddle.net/buZKf/5/
[06:48:09] <elegos> Whirl3d: it changed nothing :( see yourself: http://gear-makeup.elegosproject.org/?page=view&set=5ki4Ce9wE7fD42b0Rg6tg3QA1WM42R and http://gear-makeup.elegosproject.org/js/model_viewer.js
[06:48:22] <xec> FF76: you're still confused i think, the success function does not get passed a url, it gets passed the results of the http request
[06:48:25] <johnkpaul> mertin: no, I, nor probably anyone else, is familiar with impromptu
[06:48:28] <becom33> elegos, hold on bro . lemme check
[06:48:29] <johnkpaul> ?demo @mertin
[06:48:29] <bot-t> mertin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:48:30] <elegos> Whirl3d: it helped me only preventing the web page scrolling when scrolling within the flash
[06:48:46] <`poo> bahh latest update of chrome dev ruined my app
[06:48:57] <elegos> Whirl3d: best would be to do the inverse, too
[06:49:15] <Whirl3d> elegos, and when you click off the iframe, it appears to stop the scrolling on the model
[06:49:17] <mertin> ok will do, thanks
[06:49:20] <becom33> thanks elegos :) Thank you very mch
[06:49:42] <elegos> Whirl3d: yes, but I have to click. I tried to focus another div with no success
[06:49:44] <xec> FF76: there are two things wrong with that example though, unreadable code and async should (pretty much) never be set to false
[06:49:48] <elegos> becom33: yw :)
[06:50:06] <Christe__> is there anyway i can refresh jquerys DOM content? I got a file where i use .load to include a second document - but the elements doesnt work with the script in that case.
[06:50:13] <elegos> Whirl3d: ($("#myhiddendiv").focus())
[06:50:43] <Whirl3d> I'm getting a different response it seems. I used to click on the model viewer and it would scroll both the page and the model. Then we fixed that. But, if I used the mouse wheel to scroll the page, the model would still change. Now, the model doesn't change
[06:50:58] <xec> FF76: also, i assume you haven't changed code on that page, because i can only see the original version ;)
[06:51:13] <elegos> Whirl3d: even if you clicked that before the scroll outside the iframe?
[06:51:36] <FF76> xec: ahhh, and that result is automatically assigned to the first variable that has not been declared previously?
[06:51:45] <FF76> xec: yep, no change
[06:52:36] <xec> FF76: yes, that's essentially correct
[06:52:39] <elegos> Whirl3d: to make it clear: click inside the model viewer, scroll inside, then try scrolling outside
[06:52:55] <elegos> 1. it will move only the model, 2. it will move both the page and the model
[06:53:02] <FF76> xec: i have achieved enlightenment, thanks a lot!
[06:53:04] <elegos> if then you click outside the model, only the page will
[06:53:07] <ziz> Hey guys I use a couple jquery sliders and have noticed that on the fade in/out feature, on some versions of IE, it puts a random black shadowing on images that have transparent gradients, anyone ever see this before and/or know a fix?
[06:53:26] <Whirl3d> elegos. Let's get a baseline here so we can all understand what is going on and what you want to have happen. A) if you click on the model, the mousewheel and the mouse should change the model's appearance (but shouldn't scroll the page). B) if you click off the model, the mousewheel should sccroll the page, but not affect the model.
[06:53:26] <ziz> Do I need to do something to the photos?
[06:54:02] <Whirl3d> how funny you were doing the same thing at the same time.
[06:54:03] <Whirl3d> lol
[06:54:27] <elegos> Whirl3d: this is the actual behavior. I want not to click outside, though achieve the 2nd point when mouse-scrolling outside the iframe
[06:54:33] <Whirl3d> and by SCROLL, you mean mouse-wheeel scroll. right?
[06:54:38] <elegos> right
[06:55:03] <FF76> xec: now i'm wondering... if a second undeclared parameter were passed into a function, would it also take on the result of the httprequest?
[06:55:18] <Whirl3d> Is there any way to make an iframe lose focus?
[06:55:23] <elegos> Whirl3d: with the mousewheel plugin I succeded "locking" the iframe scroll
[06:55:35] <FF76> xec: **into a separate function
[06:56:10] <elegos> Whirl3d: shouldn't focusing another element blur the iframe?
[06:56:17] <elegos> though I tried it without success
[06:56:39] <Whirl3d> the problem is that because you have the iframe focused, it can't talk to the parent window..
[06:56:41] <xec> FF76: i think your usage of the word "undeclared" is off here, and what do you mean by second function?
[06:56:42] <elegos> $("#myIFrame").mouseout(function () { $("#mydiv").focus(); }
[06:57:01] <elegos> Whirl3d: yay I love messing with such things xD
[06:57:15] <elegos> (and I truly hate Flash, if only I could use simple canvas ahahah)
[06:57:18] <Whirl3d> and the parent window can't talk to it. I thought that would hold true for the mouse events
[06:57:36] <Whirl3d> flash 6 converts to canvas/html5 automatically
[06:57:48] <Whirl3d> bah
[06:57:53] <elegos> but flash adds loads of shit
[06:57:55] <xec> FF76: or "separate"
[06:58:05] <FF76> xec: so in the example, 'result' is the variable that takes on the result of the httprequest
[06:58:17] <elegos> and you have no control if you don't have the sources
[06:58:32] <FF76> xec: i guess undefined is a better term to call 'result'
[06:58:41] <xec> FF76: it's a parameter, not a variable, but yes
[06:59:04] <xec> it's not undefined either
[06:59:27] <xec> lets say you create your own normal function
[06:59:39] <dns-away> how i can print with (alert) the error log of javascript/jquery ?
[06:59:52] <FF76> xec: if another undefined parameter is used (e.g. function(foo){} function(foo2){}) would 'foo2' also take on the result of the httprequest?
[07:00:05] <elegos> Whirl3d: I could still hack the website fading to black all elements but the iframe to force the user click away to return navigating
[07:00:09] <Whirl3d> is there any way to "disable" the iframe?
[07:00:19] <elegos> Whirl3d: I dunno
[07:00:53] <xec> FF76: the success option only takes one callback function. inside this you can call whatever other functions you like though
[07:01:15] <elegos> Whirl3d: disabling should avoid any interaction with the user. This is what you want to achieve, right?
[07:01:20] <Whirl3d> what if you forced new content into it (the same content, but it wouldn't know)
[07:01:48] <elegos> Whirl3d: I can't control the starting rotation and zoom of the animation, so I can't make it transparentÂ£"
[07:02:03] <FF76> xec: i see, so the second undeclared variable would be undefined then?
[07:02:17] <Whirl3d> since the iframe can be a target, you could setup your regular document to notice mouseenter and then push the src...but not keep it in its current state.
[07:02:34] <Whirl3d> can you talk to the developer of the modelviewer?
[07:02:41] <Whirl3d> Or hack it ?
[07:02:43] <xec> FF76: the question doesn't make sense, you don't have any "undeclared variable"
[07:03:19] <FF76> xec: sorry, let me define what i think undeclared means (there's probably a term for it)
[07:03:20] <elegos> Whirl3d: I don't think the creator really wants this "hook" on other websites (despite of credits ofc) and I don't have any ability on decompiling SWFs
[07:03:34] <elegos> ... unfortunately
[07:03:44] <FF76> xec: in the example, 'result' is undeclared because there is no result : "value" before it
[07:03:48] <elegos> if only I could make my own model viewer, all the problems would vanish
[07:04:00] <xec> FF76: not correct
[07:04:00] <Whirl3d> i could decompile it for you, but I don't want to violate copyright 8).
[07:04:14] <xec> FF76: do you know what an object literal is?
[07:04:49] <FF76> xec: no, it seems like something basic that i should know
[07:04:55] <Whirl3d> elegos,,,yeah right...that's what I always say...
[07:05:49] <FF76> xec: oh, nevermind, i do know, but i didn't know that was the term associated with it
[07:06:06] <Whirl3d> elegos, what about this: on the document body for the iframe document, check for mouseout
[07:06:29] <elegos> Whirl3d: and make what? I can't interact with the object
[07:07:00] <xec> FF76: well, "url" and "success" and "async" are all options passed to $.ajax()  - written as an object literal
[07:07:19] <elegos> Whirl3d: the only parameter I have access I think is allowscriptaccess
[07:07:32] <elegos> but I should decompile it in order to know what commands it accepts
[07:07:52] <elegos> Use allowscriptaccess to let your Flash application communicate with the HTML page hosting it. This is required because fscommand() and getURL() operations can cause JavaScript to use the permissions of the HTML page, which can be different from the permissions of your Flash application. This has important implications for cross-domain security.
[07:08:56] <Whirl3d>  create a new document with just the flash element in it. Then in the header of the document, handle the mosue event s to detect mouseout on document.body (which will be the iFrame's body") and then you can use mouseout (not mouseleave) to bubble up to the parent document? Maybe?
[07:10:03] <elegos> Whirl3d: OBJECT and EMBED can't handle events
[07:10:11] <elegos> according to jQuery docs
[07:10:38] <elegos> ah you mean... document.body
[07:10:44] <Whirl3d> document.body
[07:10:47] <Whirl3d> yep
[07:10:56] <elegos> bubble up to the parent document = ?

[07:12:32] <james13433> I have done  $('#quick-order tr:gt(0)').each(function(index, el){ and instead there is an i function I want to stop the .each processing if its true, can I do that?
[07:13:26] <johnkpaul> hm, I was going to say throw $break
[07:13:32] <johnkpaul> but that's a prototype thing from far back in my memory
[07:13:47] <johnkpaul> I think that you'll have to add your own check for that james13433
[07:14:13] <FF76> xec: ah i see. thanks xec!
[07:14:28] <johnkpaul> just something like if(shouldNotContinue){ return; } at the top of your each function
[07:15:22] <Agamemnus> hello
[07:15:49] <Agamemnus> what is the equivalent of myobj.getElementsByClassName('myclass') in jquery?
[07:16:05] <james13433>  return false; does the trick that
[07:16:07] <james13433> thanks *
[07:17:49] <Agamemnus> for document it's $('myclass'), but what about for myobj?
[07:17:51] <Agamemnus> anyone?
[07:21:52] <elegos> Whirl3d: http://gear-makeup.elegosproject.org/html/model_viewer.php?race=nightelf&gender=female&displayInfo=5,32872,9,29925,15,50159,17,40371,7,26974,8,26944,6,39513,10,27156,1,25824,3,27023 ?
[07:21:58] <elegos> doesn't seem to work
[07:23:50] <Xotix> is it possible to get binary data from a file input ( the file itself) and use it to send files using xdomainrequest?
[07:27:03] <Agamemnus> Is .css supposed to work in IE8?
[07:27:15] <Agamemnus> I'm getting "invalid procedure call or argument".
[07:27:34] <jeffsmykil> yes
[07:27:42] <jeffsmykil> post the line
[07:27:46] <Agamemnus> here it is: control.style.left = (main.slider_position - parseInt(jQuery(control).css('width'))/2) + 'px'
[07:29:08] <asher^> use attr
[07:30:09] <Agamemnus> I need to get the computed style
[07:30:14] <Agamemnus> not the value
[07:34:39] <jeffsmykil> did you break it up and see what each value is returning
[07:35:36] <kollapse> Hello. Anyone know if throttling/debouncing works with event delegation ?
[07:35:45] <zelrik> hi
[07:36:03] <Whirl3d> elegos are you sure? I think it worked for me
[07:36:20] <Whirl3d> I click ont he model, scrollscroll
[07:36:33] <Whirl3d> then mouseout and try to scroll no movement in model
[07:36:54] <Tomashe> anyone have any experiance with instagram api?
[07:36:55] <zelrik> Can I do something like this.blah = $("#foo"); then somewhere else in the code this.blah.html("test");
[07:38:21] <dns-away> Hello, Anyone can solved me with this
[07:38:22] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/Fwtpj/
[07:38:28] <zelrik> oh
[07:38:30] <zelrik> nvm
[07:39:16] <dns-away> * http://jsfiddle.net/Fwtpj/1/
[07:39:21] <Whirl3d> dns-away, is that even correct javascript. Don't you need and =
[07:43:01] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Fwtpj/2/
[07:44:04] <dns-away> no, but thanks
[07:44:36] <Whirl3d> dns-away what you wrote doesn't make any sense.
[07:44:56] <Whirl3d> var Anchor 'a[href='javascript:test();']';
[07:45:11] <Whirl3d> is not valid
[07:46:15] <LukeNukem> How can i break a line in raw alert()
[07:46:17] <Whirl3d> it's almost like you are trying to select an anchor lement, but there's no = to assign it. And then the quotes are not correct and the attribute selector doesn't make sense...
[07:47:10] <dns-away> LukeNukem, \n
[07:50:55] <LukeNukem> dns-away, it does not alert if i put in \n
[07:51:34] <dns-away> LukeNukem, try alert('Test\nTest\nTest\n');
[07:52:15] <LukeNukem> dns-away, works normally but im doing this inside php
[07:52:46] <dns-away> Can you show your code ?
[07:53:32] <LukeNukem> dns-away, http://notey.it/n/Z28
[07:54:27] <LukeNukem> there is one tiny mistake in it which i corrected
[07:55:21] <dns-away> LukeNukem, use pastebin if is possible
[07:56:09] <LukeNukem> i have a hunch
[07:59:27] <Whirl3d> from bad posture? or is it a diet coke hunch?
[07:59:42] <dns-away> LukeNukem, you can use 	foreach($errors as $value){
[07:59:42] <dns-away> 		echo $value"\n";
[07:59:43] <dns-away> 	}
[07:59:59] <antgel> hi all, i'm reading about the widget factory http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget-factory.  can somebody explain the syntax of wrapping $.widget in (function($) { ... } (jQuery)) ?  don't understand that at all
[08:00:14] <dns-away> LukeNukem, try echo $value."\n";
[08:00:27] <LukeNukem> dns-away, trying
[08:00:48] <Whirl3d> antgel, it's called a closure. It is an automatic function that encapsulates variables at run time that are accessible by the function only.
[08:01:23] <Trisox> http://speakerdeck.com/u/dougneiner/p/jquery-plugins-beginner-to-advanced
[08:01:31] <Trisox> hf ;)
[08:01:56] <LukeNukem> dns-away, btw the alert msg must be in double quotes right
[08:02:49] <antgel> Whirl3d: okay, thanks, got it :)
[08:02:52] <LukeNukem> dns-away, nope does not work
[08:04:12] <dns-away> LukeNukem, moment
[08:05:09] <mertin> anyone using impromptu?
[08:05:35] <johnkpaul> mertin: did you make that example, yet?
[08:06:07] <mertin> I don't understand jsfiddle....
[08:06:25] <mertin> do you just paste the html inside 'html' and the javascript inside 'javascript' and that's it?
[08:06:49] <Xotix> mertin yes
[08:07:05] <mertin> and I put impromptu in the 'Library tag attributes'
[08:07:07] <Xotix> press run afterwards
[08:07:08] <mertin> is that right?
[08:07:26] <mertin> yes I pressed run but nothing happens, I think i'm not calling impromptu properly
[08:07:33] <mertin> does it go there?
[08:07:35] <Xotix> idk what that is but additional ressource can be added somewhere at the left also choose jquery at the left
[08:07:44] <dns-away> LukeNukem,
[08:07:44] <dns-away> 	echo "<script>alert('\"";
[08:07:44] <dns-away> 	foreach($errors as $value){
[08:07:44] <dns-away> 		echo "$value \n";
[08:07:44] <dns-away> 	}
[08:07:45] <dns-away> 	echo "\");</script>";
[08:09:32] <mertin> the thing is that I can't call impromptu remotely with an URL
[08:09:35] <mertin> it has to be downloaded
[08:09:37] <mertin> to be used
[08:09:44] <mertin> my jquery plugin that is
[08:10:13] <mertin> I spoke with its creator and there's no support for that
[08:10:23] <mertin> so I can't do it
[08:11:05] <Setien> I'm trying to disable a forms submit button when it's submitted, but it's having the effect of preventing them form from submitting
[08:11:17] <mertin> johnkpaul: that would mean I can't use jsfiddle?
[08:11:24] <dns-away> Anyone can help me with it ( http://jsfiddle.net/Fwtpj/11/ ), work on previous version of jQuery, Thank You :-)
[08:11:38] <Setien> I tried $( '#mysubmitbutton').click( function() { $(this).attr( 'disabled', 'disabled' ) } )
[08:12:13] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Fwtpj/12/
[08:12:21] <xec> dns-away: i'm not sure exactly what you're doing, but it looks like you got a php loop inside your javascript inside your php inside your html
[08:13:04] <xec> that was a comment to your channel paste btw, not the fiddle
[08:13:09] <dns-away> No
[08:13:09] <Brodingo> dns-away you need +'s if youre concatenating
[08:13:09] <johnkpaul> mertin: no, it does not mean that, if it is meant to runin a browser, it _can_ run in jsfiddle
[08:13:39] <johnkpaul> worst case, you can copy and paste the entire plugin mertin, but don't do that
[08:13:42] <Trisox> wait lol
[08:13:51] <mertin> he
[08:13:56] <johnkpaul> mertin: add this to the resources on the left side - http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/scripts/jquery-impromptu.4.0.min.js
[08:13:56] <mertin> johnkpaul: so....
[08:14:19] <dns-away> Brodingo, uhm i fixed it.
[08:14:23] <mertin> johnkpaul: cool! thanks
[08:14:36] <dns-away> Trisox, it say 'undefined -)
[08:15:01] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/Fwtpj/13/ :-/
[08:15:16] <xec> dns-away: http://jsfiddle.net/Fwtpj/14/
[08:15:51] <mertin> johnkpaul: and others....   it would be something like this http://jsfiddle.net/kBsxy/
[08:16:08] <mertin> but now I get those strange characters before the 'link' url
[08:16:38] <johnkpaul> mertin: you don't need <script> inside the javascript textarea
[08:16:42] <xec> mertin: don't put html in the javascript field
[08:16:48] <dns-away> xec, Yes its work fine, thanks
[08:16:54] <mertin> got it, thanks
[08:17:27] <mertin> johnkpaul: I can't find where to add extra CSS
[08:17:34] <johnkpaul> mertin: add resources
[08:17:39] <mertin> got it
[08:17:40] <johnkpaul> left side
[08:18:50] <mertin> there
[08:18:51] <mertin> http://jsfiddle.net/kBsxy/
[08:18:54] <mertin> now it's got all
[08:18:58] <Trisox> lol didn see the text part lol :D
[08:19:08] <Trisox> i should go home pff
[08:19:10] <mib_mib> if i have a jquery object like var g = $('div.some_class') , then how do i do more selectors on the var g? i.e. g.css('a.active') or something like that, what method do i use instead of 'css' here
[08:19:18] <johnkpaul> mertin: did you click on update?
[08:19:20] <johnkpaul> that's the same as before
[08:19:29] <mertin> sorry :)
[08:19:37] <mertin> http://jsfiddle.net/kBsxy/1/
[08:19:37] <johnkpaul> mib_mib: what do you mean "more selectors"?
[08:19:44] <johnkpaul> perhaps .filter
[08:19:46] <johnkpaul> ?filter @mib_mib
[08:19:46] <bot-t> mib_mib, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[08:19:54] <Trisox>  $('div.some_class , #lol , .classsomething')
[08:19:57] <Trisox> like that?
[08:20:07] <mib_mib> johnkpaul: ok i think thats what i want
[08:20:09] <mertin> johnkpaul: now I need that if the user clicks "Si" on the dialog, then I can pop up another dialog saying "all is fine"
[08:20:28] <mertin> but it doesn't work
[08:20:34] <mib_mib> basically i want to select again, but i need to select just on this jquery object
[08:20:37] <mertin> it works with the old 'alert' function
[08:20:39] <xec> mib_mib: if you want to find descendants, look at .find()
[08:20:40] <mib_mib> johnkpaul: i think that should work
[08:20:49] <mertin> but not with the impromptu prompt function
[08:21:02] <johnkpaul> ok, great mib_mib
[08:21:18] <mib_mib> Trisox: more like if u did var g = $('div.some_class') then g.filter('#lol') would work?
[08:21:29] <mertin> johnkpaul: what do you think?  http://jsfiddle.net/kBsxy/2/
[08:22:01] <xec> mib_mib: that would be equivalent to $("div.some_class#lol")
[08:22:03] <Trisox> uhh dont know what you try to do mib_mib
[08:22:30] <xec> mib_mib: if you want to do $("div.some_class #lol") you need .find() instead of .filter()
[08:22:40] <mib_mib> xec: ok
[08:22:42] <Trisox> no
[08:22:53] <Trisox> $('#lol',g)
[08:22:56] <Trisox> that would work
[08:23:06] <Trisox> no find filter stuff needed
[08:23:16] <xec> well, it is the same, yes
[08:23:22] <xec> only more confusing to read
[08:23:23] <Trisox> no its not this is faster
[08:23:33] <xec> Trisox: i doubt it
[08:24:03] <xec> Trisox: i think it's the other way around, but either way it's not a noticable difference
[08:24:20] <mertin> johnkpaul: there is my 'work in progress' .... I don't know why the 'prompt' inside the function doesn't work
[08:24:24] <mertin> http://jsfiddle.net/kBsxy/2/
[08:25:05] <Trisox> xec: http://speakerdeck.com/u/addyosmani/p/jquery-proven-performance-tips-tricks-2011
[08:25:08] <Trisox> there you go
[08:25:13] <RobOakes> Morning anyone. Would anyone have some time to answer a couple of beginner questions?
[08:25:23] <Trisox> around slide 30
[08:25:34] <RobOakes> I've just started learning jQuery and JavaScript for a couple of personal projects and have run into a problem I can't figure out.
[08:25:37] <Trisox> oh lol your right
[08:25:37] <Trisox> :D
[08:25:52] <Trisox> $parent.find('.child') is faster
[08:25:59] <johnkpaul> mertin: I don't now why either
[08:26:20] <RobOakes> I'm using jQuery to animate several portions of a site and everything works great, until I run an animation which filters and adjusts the positions of the divs on the page.
[08:26:22] <Trisox> xec: :)
[08:26:41] <RobOakes> When I do that, the animations that I first loaded using $(document).ready stop working.
[08:27:09] <RobOakes> Is there an event I can use to reattach the animations after filtering and moving the divs?
[08:27:34] <xec> Trisox: http://jsperf.com/jquery-find-vs-context-sel
[08:27:43] <xec> right
[08:27:47] <RobOakes> The plugin I'm using to do the filtering Quicksand (http://razorjack.net/quicksand/)
[08:27:52] <Trisox> :)
[08:27:52] <Trisox> hehe
[08:28:04] <xec> but it's only slightly
[08:28:16] <Trisox> yea indeed
[08:28:29] <johnkpaul> mertin: setting a timeout in your callback works
[08:28:41] <johnkpaul> I think that this is a bug, or documented incorrected usage of impromptu
[08:28:44] <Trisox> if you didnt read that presentation ;-) its a good one
[08:28:59] <johnkpaul> two impromptus cannot be active at the same tiem, I don't know why
[08:29:09] <xec> yeah i think i've seen it before
[08:29:16] <johnkpaul> perhaps fork and fix, or perhaps reach out to the author, mertin
[08:29:35] <mertin> johnkpaul: thanks a lot
[08:29:52] <Trisox> :) addy has always nice info on his blog and google + presentations
[08:29:55] <johnkpaul> no problem
[08:31:27] <gulli> Is there any particular danger in letting an Ajax call return html?
[08:31:49] <RobOakes> Is there a jQuery event that gets executed after an animation completes?
[08:32:22] <mertin> johnkpaul: but actually if I set a timeout for my prompt, then the user may not be able to click on one of the buttons. Otherwise the behavior is the same. Did you fork my jsfiddle and made it work?
[08:32:33] <Mohsen_Hassani> I'm using $.post() in django to get a list, now I can't iterate over the list items, instead, I get a letter in each loop
[08:33:01] <Trisox> RobOakes: like this http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1856-Using-jQuery-s-Animate-Step-Callback-Function-To-Create-Custom-Animations.htm ?
[08:33:20] <dabear_> Mohsen_Hassani: see ?p
[08:33:21] <bot-t> Mohsen_Hassani, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:33:35] <dabear_> ?demo @ Mohsen_Hassani
[08:33:35] <bot-t> Mohsen_Hassani, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:33:37] <johnkpaul> mertin: I did but I closed it
[08:33:41] <johnkpaul> I set a timeout in your callback
[08:34:02] <mertin> johnkpaul: yes but what benefit does that have
[08:34:07] <johnkpaul> setTimeout(function(){$.prompt("whatever");},0)
[08:34:16] <mertin> johnkpaul: only to have the prompt go after certain time
[08:34:20] <johnkpaul> ?tias @ mertin
[08:34:20] <bot-t> mertin, Try It And See
[08:34:42] <mertin> johnkpaul: I *did* try
[08:34:46] <mertin> but it's the same
[08:35:06] <RobOakes> Thanks Trisox
[08:35:30] <mertin> johnkpaul: maybe I'm setting the timeout for the first prompt and you mean the callback function. How can I set the timeout for the actual callback functyion
[08:35:43] <Trisox> np RobOakes
[08:36:04] <johnkpaul> mertin: http://jsfiddle.net/kBsxy/3/
[08:36:15] <asher^> how can i see if any values in one array match any values in another?
[08:37:30] <mertin> johnkpaul: ohhhh. I didn't know how to do that. Thanks a lot johnkpaul, you're a life saver
[08:45:45] <cat_five> hey thereâ€¦ i think i'm misunderstanding the index() methodâ€¦ how is it supposed to work? http://jsfiddle.net/gBf5L/
[08:46:24] <ziz> Hey guys I use a couple jquery sliders and have noticed that on the fade in/out feature, on some versions of IE, it puts a random black shadowing on images that have transparent gradients, anyone ever see this before and/or know a fix?
[08:46:56] <Agamemnus> ok, it looks like IE8 is giving me undefined for evt.pageX.
[08:47:15] <Agamemnus> I'm using jquery's bind:
[08:47:19] <Agamemnus> jQuery(document).bind ('mousemove', colorslider_mousemove)
[08:47:36] <Agamemnus> Then: function colorslider_mousemove (evt) { var x = evt.pageX ....
[08:47:47] <Agamemnus> Anyone know how to fix this?
[08:49:09] <johnkpaul> cat_five: http://jsfiddle.net/gBf5L/3/
[08:49:31] <johnkpaul> Agamemnus: do you have an example? that is not something very common
[08:50:23] <johnkpaul> cat_five: index, IMHO, is one of the most confusing parts of jquery
[08:50:27] <Agamemnus> using pageX is not common?
[08:50:28] <johnkpaul> I've had to re-read the docs many times
[08:50:37] <johnkpaul> Agamemnus: no, I mean, pageX being undefined is not common
[08:50:39] <cat_five> johnkpaul: thanks, but what about specifying the selector to look within? the docs say it can be done
[08:50:42] <Agamemnus> yeah but it is private...
[08:50:45] <Agamemnus> i will pm you
[08:51:04] <johnkpaul> sure, Agamemnus
[08:51:30] <Agamemnus> thanks
[08:52:29] <brettster> hey guys
[08:53:43] <brettster> i have an h2 element inside of a sidebar div. there is no set height on any of the containings divs or the h2 element, but I need the h2 element to add padding so that it stays to the bottom of the container div - as the container div changes size based on window size.
[08:53:50] <brettster> aka - it's fluid
[08:54:10] <brettster> http://eni.com.s109594.gridserver.com/default.html
[08:54:29] <brettster> so - that phone number needs to be at the bottom of the content area
[08:54:39] <brettster> but if I simply use css to do that
[08:54:44] <brettster> once the browser window changes
[08:54:48] <brettster> it just hides the phone number
[08:55:30] <johnkpaul> brettster: is this a css question?
[08:55:51] <brettster> no jquery
[08:56:03] <brettster> i want to be able to change padding-top based on window size
[08:56:53] <imsky> brettster, add a resize handler to the window and modify the padding-top based on that
[08:57:08] <brettster> idk how to do that
[08:57:14] <johnkpaul> ?resize @brettster
[08:57:15] <bot-t> brettster, .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[08:57:22] <d3str0y> I'm using Jquery Cycle to make a slideshow and for the life of me I cannot figure out how to position the text over the '.nav' area http://pastebin.com/zEcYJWCv
[08:57:31] <johnkpaul> I don't fully understand your issue brettster, but it seems like you could be using media queries for this
[08:57:58] <d3str0y> I'm basically trying to replicate the slideshow on http://mccormickgourmet.com/ but it seems that the cycle plugin wants to automatically add position:relative to the .slide area if I don't specify it
[08:58:21] <asher^> does anyone know how i can set a css property on a class such that all future elements with that class will have this property?
[08:59:21] <cat_five> johnkpaul: looking at the docs again, the only example they have of index taking a selector is not what i thought. Do you have any ideas for how I can get index of element X relative to parent Y?
[08:59:46] <johnkpaul> what do you mean parent Y? each node only has a single parent
[09:00:01] <cat_five> actually, maybe what i want to achieve is "is child of"
[09:00:09] <cat_five> i'll attack it that way
[09:00:26] <johnkpaul> .parents("selector
[09:00:39] <cat_five> (it pertains to content being changed dynamically: determining adds vs edits)
[09:00:41] <johnkpaul> oops, .parents("selector").length , cat_five
[09:00:52] <cat_five> thanks
[09:01:08] <cat_five> as usual, the problem is the solution ;)
[09:01:15] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[09:01:16] <brettster> johnkpaul i'm saying http://eni.com.s109594.gridserver.com/default.html - there is a phone number under the nav
[09:01:31] <brettster> it needs to be at the bottom of the container
[09:01:35] <brettster> which i can do with css
[09:01:40] <brettster> but as I resize the browser window
[09:01:48] <brettster> the phone number get's hidden.
[09:02:05] <cat_five> brettster: position: relative?
[09:02:08] <brettster> I need it to gradually decrease in padding based on window resize
[09:02:20] <brettster> doesnt work
[09:02:23] <cat_five> in that case, position: absolute
[09:02:27] <brettster> doesnt work
[09:02:56] <brettster> cat_five
[09:03:04] <cat_five> where does the number need to be? footer on or the bottom of the white
[09:03:29] <brettster> how do you think adding padding-top 300px and resizing the window
[09:03:35] <brettster> is going to lower the padding
[09:03:41] <brettster> with pos absolute
[09:03:49] <brettster> it nees to be right above the footer.
[09:04:57] <tw2113> bottom: 0;
[09:05:06] <cat_five> i didn't say anything about padding. i see now that the hight of the footer changes on resize
[09:05:09] <tw2113> start actually positioning it within the parent container
[09:05:46] <brettster> http://eni.com.s109594.gridserver.com/default.html
[09:05:54] <brettster> maybe im doing something wrong in my css
[09:05:59] <brettster> but i've done bottom 0 as well
[09:06:03] <brettster> but on window resize
[09:06:13] <brettster> it still gets hidden
[09:06:27] <brettster> dont you guys use firebug or dev tools?
[09:06:42] <cat_five> fwiw brettster, i don't see it on my display at all until i override the padding
[09:06:46] <PrgmrBill> if I'm initializing a plugin like $('#foo').plugin() how do I access $('#foo') ?
[09:06:47] <cat_five> regardless of size
[09:07:49] <tw2113> personally i'd add a wrapper div around header/content/footer, so it's not absolutely positioned to the body overall
[09:07:59] <Agamemnus> jQuery(window).bind('load', initialize_colorslider_set) doesn't work
[09:08:03] <tw2113> and instead the container it's in
[09:08:19] <tw2113> but that's just me upon quick look
[09:08:42] <tw2113> it'd prevent everything from swimming around so much
[09:08:53] <Agamemnus> anyone know why?
[09:08:59] <Agamemnus> it never runs
[09:09:15] <cat_five> or perhaps put the tag in the footer, and then give it negative top margin
[09:09:35] <cat_five> bottom line is that dynamic padding is overkill for simple positioning
[09:09:38] <cat_five> imo
[09:10:25] <Agamemnus> nvm jquery defined later
[09:11:17] <mertin> johnkpaul: or anyone else using jsfiddle.... how long do unsaved fiddles last?
[09:11:23] <mertin> if I just tested and saved the url
[09:12:28] <mertin> didn't find an answer to that in the FAQ
[09:13:44] <johnkpaul> mertin: afaik, indefinitely if it is saved
[09:15:52] <qvarkk> im using jQuery like this jQuery(document).ready(function($) {    : when i open a copy of the page in a popup (window.open)  i get a reference prolbem through $  -can this be because of the parent?
[09:19:00] <lotus> hey, I am running $('.delete').bind('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); alert('a'); }); inside of a call to console.log() -- console says [a.delete #] where # is the href attribute -- all seems good -- but the click just gets passed through with no alert -- any ideas?
[09:19:48] <qvarkk> how can i prevent a jqeury conflict when loading two instances of one page with a popup?
[09:20:43] <lotus> qvarkk: what's the conflict?
[09:21:02] <johnkpaul> ?demo @lotus
[09:21:02] <bot-t> lotus, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:21:05] <asher^> lotus, i dont think you can do click with an <a>
[09:21:11] <qvarkk> the popup has an relationship with its parent, therefor the same js file (with $) doesnt work
[09:21:38] <johnkpaul> asher^: you can
[09:21:47] <asher^> oh my bad, you can too
[09:21:53] <lotus> qvarkk: try jQuery instead of $ as a temporary solution
[09:22:09] <qvarkk> lotus: but it will still be the same in the two files
[09:22:11] <qvarkk> ?
[09:22:40] <lotus> qvarkk: oh...
[09:23:57] <asher^> lotus, earlier i couldnt get it to prevent going to the link, but i got it to get the click using .live
[09:24:07] <sekretskwerl> hey yus guys, i added debunce.js to my app's javascripts, restarted server, and its telling me jQuery does not have function debounce. what could be wrong?
[09:24:47] <cat_five> sekretskwerl: you added the script before jquery, perhaps
[09:25:20] <johnkpaul> cat_five: did you figure out your index problem?
[09:25:41] <cat_five> yep. or rather, reframed the problem ;)
[09:25:48] <cat_five> thanks for straightening me out on index()
[09:26:36] <sekretskwerl> cat_five: actually, now that i look, chrome's dev console isn't even showing it in my list of scripts. it's not getting included for some reason. let me see if i can correct that.
[09:26:51] <cat_five> could be related ;)
[09:27:39] <cat_five> i do wish jquery supported selector.index(element), though
[09:27:58] <sekretskwerl> cat_five: ah, i forgot that i switched git branches, stashed when i had added it into my asset pipeline
[09:27:58] <cat_five> it would be handy for situations where you don't have unique id's everywhere
[09:27:59] <lotus> asher^: johnkpaul: hahaha :)  So, I wrote the code once using html += '....'; and decided to rewrite it using element = $('<...>'); parent.append(element); right? initially, I had to unbind all previous click events and then rebind, globally, the click on the delete button (so it affected all of the delete buttons) -- inspired me to rewrite -- well, after the rewrite, I was using deleteButton.bind('click'...) and at the end of my function I still had ('.delete
[09:28:04] <sekretskwerl> thus, its not even getting loaded.
[09:28:06] <lotus> god bless simple errors
[09:28:23] <johnkpaul> cat_five: no problem, yeah, I agree, but there's a way to achieve the same goal with more code
[09:29:24] <johnkpaul> cat_five: the issue with that though is that your definition of "index within any ancestor" is arbitary
[09:29:27] <johnkpaul> arbitrary*
[09:29:44] <cat_five> i'd assume it would mean direct children
[09:29:45] <cat_five> but yes
[09:30:03] <ajpiano> cat_five: jquery does support $(selector).index(element)
[09:30:14] <cat_five> good luck with that ajpiano ;)
[09:30:25] <ajpiano> ...
[09:30:27] <cat_five> i just battled it because it did not work the way i'd expected
[09:30:34] <cat_five> perhaps you have different expectations
[09:30:56] <cat_five> you are right, it does support that syntax
[09:31:14] <sviatovigt> how can I find the z-index of an element?
[09:31:25] <cat_five> .css('z-index')
[09:31:26] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: it just didn't do what cat_five expected it to do
[09:31:35] <ajpiano> cat_five: the second argument has to be an element, not another selector
[09:31:47] <ck> Hi Guys
[09:31:54] <ck> can anyone help me
[09:32:02] <cat_five> ajpiano: what i assumed, wrongly, was that the selector could be the parent, and the element could be the child
[09:32:11] <ajpiano> oih
[09:32:30] <Guest27704> actually i m looking for something.
[09:32:49] <ajpiano> yea it's setOfThings.index(thingYouWantIndexOf) not setOfThings.magicalImplicitDomTraversal.index(thingyouWantIndexOf) ?
[09:32:50] <ajpiano> :)
[09:33:01] <cat_five> so what i'm saying is WHY DOES IT DO WHAT IT DOES RATHER THAN WHAT I WANT
[09:33:16] <cat_five> eh, it wouldn't be magic
[09:33:29] <ajpiano> sounds like magic to me
[09:33:33] <lotus> qvarkk: I'm not sure I understand the problem.  Can you show me it live?
[09:33:51] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: haha, if only method signatures were that obvious!
[09:34:03] <qvarkk> lotus: i've found the actual problem now. the window.open popup doesn't trigger document.ready
[09:34:22] <cat_five> if passed a selector, find the parent, enumerate the children, return index of this
[09:34:29] <cat_five> unless i'm missing something glaringly obvious
[09:34:41] <cat_five> ah, because it can already take a selector
[09:34:47] <ajpiano> cat_five: index with no args finds the index of an element within its siblings
[09:34:57] <Guest27704> "i want to provide a textbox to user and when he type in that textbox ajax search will be performed after a match he will select that and a selected value will be in text box having cancel option and in same he can add another value :plugin fot that ? any idea"
[09:35:07] <ajpiano> index with a selector arg finds the index of the orginal element within *all* elems that match the selector arg
[09:35:15] <lotus> qvarkk: wow, good to know!  How did you fix?
[09:35:18] <ajpiano> index with an element arg finds the index of the element arg inside of the original selection
[09:35:19] <ajpiano> fin.
[09:36:32] <qvarkk> lotus:  haven't :/
[09:37:57] <sviatovigt> cat_five: even if I didn't previously declared a z-index?
[09:38:13] <cat_five> if you didn't declare one and don't have one in your css, it's 0 by default
[09:39:04] <qvarkk> how can i trigger documen.ready in my popup? current code: http://pastebin.com/20JYzh4s
[09:39:09] <sviatovigt> ok
[09:39:10] <sviatovigt> thank you
[09:39:15] <cat_five> np
[09:43:04] <cat_five> i don't really have the answer, qvarkk, but modals really make working with "pop up" content a lot easier
[09:43:21] <qvarkk> cat_five:  can you provide a function name
[09:43:41] <cat_five> it's not built into query, but there are a lot of easy ways to add it
[09:43:41] <qvarkk> cat_five: the only reason im doing popup is that an iframe inside iframe isn't really good for me
[09:43:51] <qvarkk> cat_five: a function for modal creating that is
[09:44:16] <cat_five> wait, your content is iframed?
[09:45:31] <qvarkk> cat_five: yes
[09:47:18] <qvarkk> cat_five: i'd have to use an iframe with the modal, right?
[09:47:24] <clh> hi all .. I think I'm using $.ajax wrong .. I need to return a true/false from success(), but it doesn't seem to work .. what might I be doing wrong?
[09:47:39] <cat_five> no, modal content is inline
[09:48:53] <qvarkk> cat_five: aha
[09:48:59] <qvarkk> i need a new url to load :(
[10:11:27] <lotus> qvarkk: modals are awesomely created using "Reveal"
[10:21:52] <rakm> i'm upgrading an old project from 1.3.2 to 1.7.2, any pointers on how to do this smoothly?
[10:32:54] <evasivx> I'm hoping someone can help me. Can someone explain why the page isn't animating when it links to it's anchor? (the navgation buttons) the jquery code is at the bottom of the page: projectomni.com/print1/
[10:37:50] <asher^> any of you guys use the ui multiselect widget?
[10:38:24] <Jayflux> rakm http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/03/jquery-16-released/ read the breaking changes bit
[10:39:43] <evasivx> I feel there is something so easy that i'm missing
[10:50:47] <jklmnop> i have multiple instances of jquery on my page. 1.3.x under $ and jQuery and 1.7.x under myobj.$â€¦ i need plugin x to be applied to myobj.$. is there a best way to get that to happen without hacking the plugin's source by wrapping it in (function($){â€¦})(myobj.$)
[10:58:36] <Danielpk> is there any action to bind always when one iframe load some content?
[10:59:08] <Danielpk> i tried with $('iframe').load(function(){ console.log('old'); });
[11:10:09] <Gm3> Hello people
[11:12:21] <jita> Won't dropdown.js work without bootstrap css files ?
[11:14:00] <Gm3> I need help with returning an serialized array from an sortable object
[11:14:01] <Gm3> http://pastebin.com/qhpjZi9A
[11:14:32] <Gm3> If i change the sortable now i see in the #DebugTestBox "[object Object],[object Object]"
[11:14:45] <Gm3> How can i format that to readable text?
[11:15:42] <johnkpaul> Gm3: override toString?
[11:16:14] <brettster> http://eni.com.s109594.gridserver.com/default.html
[11:16:14] <brettster> [14:14:12] <brettster> could anyone tell me why my text is flowing below the footer like that?
[11:16:19] <Gm3> $("#DebugTestBox").text(ser.toString()); ?
[11:16:30] <Mariaa> hi, i am using the cycle plugin but the function doesn't work somehow http://axactsoft.com/test-2/
[11:16:31] <brettster> do i need to use jquery
[11:16:43] <Mariaa> i am not getting any error on console too
[11:17:28] <Gm3> johnkpaul, still returns "[object Object],[object Object]"
[11:18:20] <johnkpaul> ?eval var obj={};obj.toString=function(){return "not [object Object]";};print(obj)
[11:18:23] <bot-t> johnkpaul: {"toString": <function () {return "not [object Object]";}>}
[11:18:39] <johnkpaul> ?eval var obj={};obj.toString=function(){return "not [object Object]";};obj
[11:18:39] <bot-t> johnkpaul: {"toString": <function () {return "not [object Object]";}>}
[11:19:20] <johnkpaul> hm, the bot isn't doing what I'd expect
[11:19:24] <sekretskwerl> anyone familiar with the debounce library?
[11:19:35] <Gm3> hmm
[11:19:37] <johnkpaul> Gm3: add a function to ser called toString(), and inside that fucntion, return a string
[11:19:51] <johnkpaul> that string can be whatever you want, and has access to everything inside ser using "this"
[11:20:01] <johnkpaul> sekretskwerl: what's the question?
[11:20:01] <Gm3> hmm
[11:20:04] <Gm3> im not sure i understand you
[11:20:17] <DeltaHeavy> I'm calling .change events with .change() from a .click event, however it's calling the change event twice. I'm not clicking on 2 classes overlapping on eachother. Anybody ever run into this before or have any ideas to fix this?
[11:21:04] <sekretskwerl> johnkpaul: I customized Typeahead into a library called "Winecomplete". I am trying to use debounce inside of the keyup() function, for when it calls lookup(), so I did $.debounce(this.lookup(), 250) and it did absolutely nothing.
[11:21:49] <johnkpaul> Gm3: what is your end goal? have [object Object] be something more descriptive?
[11:21:58] <DeltaHeavy> http://pastebin.com/6diG4TS6
[11:22:10] <Gm3> Well it's an sortable, and i want to get the order in MySQL
[11:22:12] <Edulix> hi people, how can I get the color of a given coordinate in an svg shown in my webpage?
[11:22:19] <Gm3> MySQL/PHP
[11:22:34] <Gm3> but i'm kinda new to jquery, so it's pretty hard
[11:22:36] <FinalAngel> an1 know how I can get the key name through this.parent()? http://jsfiddle.net/jS5ER/
[11:22:43] <brettster> anyone
[11:22:50] <johnkpaul> sekretskwerl: the first parameter to debounce should be a number and the second should be a function, also remove  your ()
[11:23:29] <Mariaa> hi, i am using the cycle plugin but the function doesn't work somehow http://axactsoft.com/test-2/
[11:23:33] <Mariaa> i am not getting any error on console too
[11:24:08] <sekretskwerl> johnkpaul: that is contrary to the documentation and whats in the source, but i will try.
[11:24:39] <johnkpaul> sekretskwerl: which debounce are you using, the ben_alman one, or something else?
[11:25:04] <johnkpaul> you should use this one http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[11:25:57] <Gm3> johnkpaul?
[11:26:55] <johnkpaul> Gm3: so I don't know the sortable API very well, so I don't know the details, but you're going to need to send an ajax call using $.ajax to your backend with the inforatmion about the sort order every time a sort has taken place
[11:27:05] <johnkpaul> I assume that's in the onStop handler
[11:27:32] <johnkpaul> Gm3: you're using the jquery UI sortables?
[11:27:51] <Gm3> no i don't
[11:28:12] <johnkpaul> what are you using to sort?
[11:28:54] <Gm3> I have seriously no idea, i got it from my designer
[11:28:58] <Gm3> let me show you
[11:29:44] <johnkpaul> Gm3: have you used javascript or jquery before?
[11:29:54] <Gm3> a little little bit
[11:30:07] <sekretskwerl> johnkpaul: wheres the download link/source??
[11:30:19] <johnkpaul> ?learn @Gm3
[11:30:19] <bot-t> Gm3, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:30:27] <sekretskwerl> johnkpaul: also, i'm usingâ€¦this one: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-debounce/
[11:30:31] <johnkpaul> Gm3:  you have some learning to do before you can accomplish this
[11:30:41] <Gm3> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=bjmhhJyM
[11:30:52] <johnkpaul> sekretskwerl: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[11:31:11] <johnkpaul> Gm3: :) I can't read that
[11:31:25] <Gm3> i see
[11:31:36] <Gm3> but could you atleast give me an example of what you said
[11:31:50] <Gm3> since however i try to echo the ser it returns object object
[11:32:39] <johnkpaul> ?g JSON.stringify @ Gm3
[11:32:40] <bot-t> Gm3, JSON in JavaScript - http://www.json.org/js.html
[11:32:58] <johnkpaul> Gm3:I don't see from your page where Sortable comes form
[11:33:01] <johnkpaul> perhaps interface.js
[11:33:24] <johnkpaul> you can use JSON.stringify(obj) to get a serialization
[11:33:27] <johnkpaul> that is not [object Object]
[11:33:35] <Jon47> Gm3 you can't just "echo" a variable and see everything about it in javascript like a var_dump in php, it's a lot more complicated than that..
[11:33:46] <johnkpaul> but that is not available on old IE's
[11:33:57] <johnkpaul> well, for development, you can console.dir Jon47
[11:34:06] <johnkpaul> which is IMHO much more useful that var_dump/export
[11:34:13] <sekretskwerl> johnkpaul: ok, so i swapped out the code. now $.debounce(300, this.lookup) just does nothing.
[11:34:14] <rroelofs> Gm3:  you need a browser with good dev tools like Firefox + firebug or Chrome
[11:34:19] <johnkpaul> Gm3: also, using the latest jquery is dangerous
[11:34:29] <Gm3> why?
[11:34:30] <Gm3> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ngZbPWzR
[11:34:48] <johnkpaul> I mean, that URL is _always_ the latest, you should choose a specific version, or things will just break one day
[11:35:04] <johnkpaul> Gm3: that's interface.js?
[11:35:26] <Gm3> yes
[11:35:29] <johnkpaul> haha
[11:35:34] <johnkpaul> your designer hates you?

[11:41:41] <sekretskwerl> johnkpaul: this fiddle thing is weird. it's a rails project, though, and what i'm doing is reading from around 6+ different queries and javascripts, so I don't think I can reproduce it on this.
[11:42:16] <johnkpaul> Gm3: this is going to be practically impossible without knowing how Sortable works
[11:42:19] <sekretskwerl> this would be really cool, though, for something smaller
[11:42:32] <johnkpaul> sekretskwerl: so make something smaller that explains your issue

[12:06:48] <tejinder> Which is the best plugin for navigation item drop down menu ?
[12:10:15] <Brodingo> tejinder probably css
[12:10:45] <tejinder> Brodingo, why is css preferred ?
[12:12:59] <Brodingo> tejinder because it works even without js and its not hard at all
[12:13:09] <sekretskwerl> im just going to reinvent the computer, using magic and pascal
[12:23:13] <arnpro> how can I attach click event to a disabled field and have it work??
[12:26:36] <ZeuZ> Got a problem, I'm matching with this selector ('[id="^ELIMINAR"]'), however, uppon appending a new one dinamically, it's not calling the designed on 'click', function()
[12:26:55] <arnpro> ZeuZ: I think you need .live() for that
[12:27:07] <arnpro> or .on() or delegate() on a parent element, ZeuZ
[12:27:09] <ZeuZ> arnpro, but .live is deprecated
[12:27:15] <RandalSchwartz> didn't .on() take over ... yeah
[12:27:46] <ZeuZ> arnpro, can't on/delegate on a parent since the whole thing is dynamically created
[12:28:09] <johnkpaul> arnpro: there might be a better way, but this is my first thought http://jsfiddle.net/Wtjj5/
[12:29:09] <johnkpaul> ZeuZ: you can, you just need to use document.body
[12:29:14] <johnkpaul> but, that might not necessarily be the best way
[12:29:27] <johnkpaul> your entire page is built dynamically, ZeuZ?
[12:29:37] <ZeuZ> johnkpaul, I was just just checking your fiddle
[12:29:49] <ZeuZ> not entirely, but the elements that are not matched are
[12:29:51] <johnkpaul> that was for arnpro, ZeuZ
[12:30:03] <arnpro> was for me, but johnkpaul I was thinking something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/2LqYV/1/
[12:30:14] <ZeuZ> johnkpaul, yeah but I thought I might get some idea from that
[12:31:32] <johnkpaul> eh, arnpro, I don't know how to do taht directly, but you could create a .clickDisabledElements on jQuery.fn if you wanted that syntax
[12:32:29] <arnpro> johnkpaul: I'm just trying to get the click element to work on the disabled ones, however it won't. Have tried different selectors, nothing
[12:33:31] <johnkpaul> arnpro: apparently this is not easily addressed in multiple browsers
[12:33:31] <johnkpaul> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3100319/jquery-event-on-a-disabled-input
[12:33:39] <johnkpaul> so don't use what I gave you, because that won't work
[12:33:45] <johnkpaul> you might need to fake being disabled
[12:33:51] <innociv_> Why is parseInt('$2') NaN?
[12:34:20] <ZeuZ> The '$' char is messing that up
[12:34:41] <johnkpaul> innociv_: because that's not an int
[12:34:48] <johnkpaul> and it's not a number
[12:34:55] <ZeuZ> parseInt('$2'.split('$')[1]) might work
[12:34:56] <innociv_> it takes a string
[12:35:07] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn parseInt @ innociv_
[12:35:08] <bot-t> innociv_, parseInt - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[12:35:10] <innociv_> ZeuZ, and if it's $bebab2?
[12:35:33] <ZeuZ> innociv_ well, it's allways up to YOU to filter and remove crap values hehe
[12:35:39] <johnkpaul> ?eval "$bebab2".match(/\d+/)
[12:35:41] <bot-t> johnkpaul: ["2"]
[12:35:56] <johnkpaul> ^^ @innociv_
[12:35:57] <ZeuZ> regexp ftw
[12:36:27] <innociv_> That'll work.
[12:43:07] <ZeuZ> johnkpaul, want to see a live example to see what I'm talking about?
[12:46:53] <johnkpaul> ZeuZ: no, I think I get the idea, why not use .on()?
[12:46:57] <johnkpaul> ?on @ZeuZ
[12:46:58] <bot-t> ZeuZ, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:47:04] <ZeuZ> I'm using it
[12:47:11] <ZeuZ> $(document).on('click','[name="AGREGAR"]',function() {
[12:47:14] <ZeuZ> argh
[12:47:18] <ZeuZ> sorry wrong snippet
[12:47:25] <ZeuZ> $(document).on('click','[name^="ELIMINAR"]', function() {
[12:47:51] <ZeuZ> oh wait
[12:47:55] <ZeuZ> I get where I messed up
[12:48:12] <ZeuZ> This latest element is being added with id^="ELIMINAR"
[12:48:14] <ZeuZ> not name
[12:48:22] <johnkpaul> :)
[12:48:42] <ZeuZ> jeez, took time to recognize that xD sorry
[12:48:52] <ziz> Hey guys I use a couple jquery sliders and have noticed that on the fade in/out feature, on some versions of IE, it puts a random black shadowing on images that have transparent gradients, anyone ever see this before and/or know a fix?
[12:49:07] <jedimind> also the point of .on is to attach the event to the most immediate parent container, generally not document
[12:49:09] <jedimind> but yeah
[12:54:23] <ziz> really no one? I figured this should be a big issue
[12:55:09] <chris_n> is it possible to return an array of  attr values w/o using .each ?
[12:55:46] <johnkpaul> chris_n: without .map too?
[12:56:07] <jedimind> ziz animating opacity of an alpha transparent png causes the black fragmenting around its edges, there's no real way around it
[12:56:35] <ziz> So is it just semi transparent areas?
[12:56:39] <chris_n> johnkpaul: well, I'm trying to reduce the number of times I have to iterate
[13:00:54] <adac> Guys, shouldn't "alert(encodeURI(uri))" envcode me the URL? instead I still get plaintext
[13:07:09] <someprimetime> is it possible that if a mosuedown was detected inside of a chained mouseover/mouseout event, to not execute the chained mouseout event?
[13:07:10] <someprimetime> e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/uT7tZ/
[13:07:21] <someprimetime> mosuedown = mousedown*
[13:14:34] <beffbernard> Seems like there should be a better way this: https://refheap.com/paste/2512
[13:15:02] <someprimetime> that's not js
[13:15:09] <beffbernard> oops
[13:15:11] <beffbernard> :D
[13:15:14] <beffbernard> wrong channel
[13:15:14] <someprimetime> try #clojure
[13:15:17] <beffbernard> sorry
[13:15:20] <someprimetime> but i'm jelly that you know clojure
[13:15:22] <someprimetime> no worries
[13:16:32] <Goopyo> I am changing the img src via jquery. Is there anyway to put a gif there while the image loads?
[13:22:04] <Goopyo> is there a way to ajax load an image so while its loading I can put a gif in place?
[13:23:57] <Eviltwin> It's not actually AJAX
[13:23:59] <johnkpaul-afk> Goopyo: ?load( @Goopyo
[13:24:06] <Eviltwin> It's just using the load event of the image
[13:24:10] <johnkpaul-afk> ?load( @Goopyo
[13:24:12] <bot-t> Goopyo, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:24:33] <johnkpaul-afk> you can put your gif in place, and then add a handler to .load()
[13:24:43] <johnkpaul-afk> that removes your gif and shows the new image
[13:25:21] <Goopyo> so I dont change the src of the img tag?
[13:25:35] <johnkpaul-afk> no
[13:26:18] <Goopyo> wait actually I do, it seems like if I reading correctly its something like:
[13:26:55] <Goopyo> change the img src to the new one > check if loaded > if loaded remove gif ?
[13:27:54] <Goopyo> or I guess I can do a replace
[13:32:41] <johnkpaul-afk> Goopyo: I'd have two image elements not just one
[13:32:53] <Goopyo> I think I got it to work
[13:40:11] <Axsuul> I'm using the endless scroll jquery plugin .. $(window).endlessScroll, is there any way to unbind/cancel that?
[13:41:44] <smykes> Why can't Safari let you search from the URL bar?  Too much to ask?
[13:45:03] <someprimetime> Axsuul: $(window).unbind('scroll') ?
[13:47:39] <rroelofs> smykes: because it's not chrome? :-)
[13:47:40] <djuggler> I've got a dialog box with a form, an okay button , a cancel button and the closing X. I want cancel button and the X to destroy the dialog box naturally. When the OK button is clicked, rather than simply  accepting the values in the form I want to do some validations.  If the validations fail, how do I prevent the dialog from closing because of the press on OK?
[13:49:52] <djuggler> nm. had a typo. Works fine.
[14:04:07] <smsfail> trying to fire a simple alert inside of a $.getJSON, but nothing happens. Line #44 in this paste. anyone take a quick peek? http://dpaste.de/RyUOY/
[14:04:12] <smsfail> the URL is valid
[14:15:05] <blendedbychris> whats a good page "scroller" that adds hash stuff to the url?
[14:15:07] <rroelofs> smsfail: are you using chrome / firefox so that you can see the headers that w3schools is sending back?
[14:16:43] <rroelofs> smsfail:  it is not being served with a content-type so it is being treated as plain text

[14:40:17] <max____> Hey guys, silly question â€” but how do I capture the URL that gets sent when you submit a form?
[14:46:04] <jstout24> i'm being dumbâ€¦ i have a form in a jquery-ui dialog and on submit, i want to close the ui dialogâ€¦ how?
[14:51:33] <freemind> hello, I want to access the selected option of a <select> box and calling a function with onChange().. how to access the object which calls the function? $(this) is not working :(
[14:52:50] <nFFF> $(this+':selected')
[14:53:34] <freemind> thank you nFFF, do I have to pass anything to the function call?
[14:57:09] <arnpro> is it possible to prevent default behavior of a checkbox, while checking a function result? of if result is true, check it, else, leave it unchecked?
[14:58:06] <nFFF> freemind http://jsfiddle.net/372ff/
[14:58:21] <redShadow> jstout24: something like this? $('#myform').submit(function(e){e.preventDefault(); $('#mydialog').dialog('close'); });
[14:58:43] <nFFF> ?preventdefault @ arnpro
[14:58:43] <bot-t> arnpro, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[14:59:04] <jstout24> redShadow, yeah i got it. all my dialogs are custom and can have many dialogs
[14:59:42] <freemind> thankyou nFFF, will this also work when I use onChange="func()" to call it?
[15:00:06] <nFFF> why would you?
[15:00:13] <nFFF> keep html for the markup
[15:00:16] <nFFF> and js for the js
[15:00:22] <freemind> ok nFFF
[15:00:26] <freemind> :)
[15:00:46] <freemind> would it work nFFF?
[15:02:02] <nFFF> ?tiass
[15:02:03] <bot-t> nFFF, Couldn't find "tiass" in jQuery Docs.
[15:02:03] <nFFF> ?tias
[15:02:04] <bot-t> Try It And See
[15:03:35] <freemind> i create these selectboxes dynamically nFFF, would be easier to use onChange but it doesnt work with $(this)
[15:05:17] <james13433> is there anything wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/vGDNaTwK it says that function is not defined
[15:06:40] <nFFF> james13433, what are you trying to do
[15:06:46] <nFFF> theres lots wrong with that :|
[15:07:23] <james13433> nFF I have some code in a js file, and I have just coded it in like,, x.click(){do this this this and this}
[15:07:24] <mirzu> james13433:  where is the initPartFinder function defined?
[15:07:54] <james13433> but I am doing some ajax calls so I want the url to be right all the time, so I need to get the url in the html bit, hence that call
[15:08:55] <freemind> nFFF, please tell me how to use jQuery with onChange :|
[15:09:01] <nFFF> that function is going to be out of scope

[15:14:37] <james13433> nFFF, so to call it from html I will need to stop wrapping with (function($) and use jQuery(...)
[15:14:40] <james13433> ?
[15:14:49] <nFFF> and you have methods trying to call other methods in other scopes
[15:15:04] <nFFF> you don't need jQuery() thats redundant
[15:15:13] <james13433> Well I do when I have prototype
[15:15:17] <nFFF> you don't need (function($)
[15:15:23] <nFFF> sorry copied wrong thing
[15:15:29] <nFFF> you can just use jQuery(selector)
[15:15:36] <james13433> yeah thats what I mean
[15:18:25] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/UzWB5/1/ this is the ideal style

[15:36:57] <_Tristan> Hi. http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/ I'm sure there's a very simple solution to this issue... I've just never been able to figure it out.
[15:36:58] <Goopyo> http://jsfiddle.net/CLTf3/*
[15:37:05] <Goopyo> it works once then it doesnt
[15:37:12] <nFFF> james13433 use jQ or $j whatever floats your boat
[15:37:14] <nFFF> or $$
[15:37:25] <james13433> $$?
[15:37:25] <nFFF> var jQ = jQuery.noConflict();
[15:37:27] <_Tristan> Goopyo: because you have no html or css
[15:37:40] <nFFF> you can assign jQuery to any custom variable
[15:37:49] <Goopyo> _Tristan: I meant on the actual site...
[15:38:02] <Goopyo> wondering if theres anything im doing wrong in the code
[15:38:06] <freemind> please wait a few minutes b4 going 2 sleep nFFF
[15:38:20] <james13433> yeah but then you have to use that thing don't you like (function($){},jQuery); or something like that
[15:38:25] <_Tristan> Goopyo: It'd be easier to figure out if there was some html
[15:38:37] <james13433> and I thought thats my shizzle out of scope?
[15:38:43] <nFFF> james13433 no not at all
[15:38:44] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/HjuxZ/3/
[15:39:12] <james13433> but what If I wanted $ ?
[15:39:34] <nFFF> youll have issues if another library has claimed it
[15:39:34] <djuggler> still stuck.  $("#foo").dialog()   with a cancel and an ok button and an input element.  The behaviors I'm looking for: cancel - closes the dialog no questions asked. ok- uses getJSON or ajax to see if the value in the input exists on the server (which returns { "bar" : "Yes" } or { "bar" : "No" }  If it returns No then the dialog box should stay open. If it returns yes the dialog box should...
[15:39:36] <djuggler> ...close.
[15:39:43] <james13433> ok
[15:39:51] <nFFF> but like shown in fiddle
[15:39:51] <djuggler> Is there a beforeSubmit function? or something similar?
[15:40:01] <nFFF> you can asssignt he jquery namespace to any custom character
[15:40:50] <nFFF> '$$' beats typing 'jQuery' everyimte :D
[15:40:57] <_Tristan> would it be unseemly of me to quote my previous question?
[15:41:30] <nFFF> _Tristan what was it?
[15:41:47] <_Tristan> well, ok. "Hi. http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/ I'm sure there's a very simple solution to this issue... I've just never been able to figure it out."
[15:42:49] <nFFF> _Tristan simple solution to do what
[15:42:58] <nFFF> wait 1 second before fading out?
[15:43:00] <freemind> nFFF, looks like $(this) means the whole <form> object? I get all selected fields with this call $(this+':selected').text()
[15:43:04] <_Tristan> the second message should stay for ten seconds instead of one
[15:43:39] <nFFF> second message? :S
[15:43:43] <nFFF> theres only one line of code
[15:44:07] <_Tristan> oh, that's weird, my link pointed to the wrong thing
[15:44:18] <_Tristan> http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/14146/
[15:44:22] <nFFF> freemind, just do it how I showed you the first first time
[15:46:19] <freemind> nFFF, I would.. but I need to use onChange mate
[15:46:44] <MistuhKurtz> _Tristan, I always have trouble with delay()
[15:46:52] <freemind> can you please have a look nFFF?
[15:47:02] <MistuhKurtz> I don't think it does exactly what you think it does.
[15:47:31] <freemind> nFFF, please just change "accomodation"
[15:49:37] <Goopyo> _Tristan: http://jsfiddle.net/75Fwh/
[15:49:49] <Goopyo> note that if you change that gif to something that doesnt exitst it works fine
[15:52:27] <nFFF> _Tristan, it's becuase your calling fadein on the parent element
[15:52:32] <nFFF> fadeout sorry
[15:53:03] <nFFF> your first function call after 10 seconds will hide the parent element
[15:53:13] <MistuhKurtz> the stop() method is stopping the fx queue, and delay() works by pausing the effects queue
[15:53:31] <MistuhKurtz> also, you're calling fadein and fadeout at the same time on the same element
[15:54:08] <MistuhKurtz> comment out the line with stop(), and it will work, but you will see it fade out then fade in again...but it will still wait the 10seconds before fading out the 2nd message
[15:54:18] <james13433> nFFF how would I call addNewRow on click like this http://pastebin.com/NESkpALC
[15:54:30] <james13433> do i not near the ready function bit?
[15:54:42] <MistuhKurtz> The whole way it's written needs to be fixed up
[15:55:10] <MistuhKurtz> but anyways, 99% of the time I prefer to use setTimeout(), unless it very explicitly has to do with the effects queue.
[15:55:54] <nFFF> james13433 thats fine
[15:55:57] <_Tristan> wow, delay is really useless
[15:56:00] <james13433> its not :(
[15:56:04] <nFFF> but you dont need to wrap your bottom have in jQuery( .. .)
[15:56:23] <nFFF> what is that jQuery(function(){ ?
[15:56:31] <_Tristan> yeah, this thing was based off of one of jsfiddle's examples and it came with that
[15:56:32] <nFFF> remvoe it
[15:56:33] <james13433> addNewRow is not defined
[15:56:49] <_Tristan> $(function(){}) is $(document).ready(function(){}) shorthand
[15:56:55] <MistuhKurtz> delay isn't useless. It's just misunderstood
[15:57:09] <james13433> $(function() { the ready handler this
[15:57:12] <MistuhKurtz> I thought it was like setTimeout, but made to work with jQuery chaining, when I first used it
[15:57:24] <nFFF> sorry my bad not used to ready it 'jQuery(
[15:57:25] <MistuhKurtz> and I was wrong, which led to bugs and disappointment :P
[15:57:45] <nFFF> james13433 your code looks fine
[15:57:51] <nFFF> I have to sleep gl though
[15:57:57] <james13433> Ok thanks
[15:58:22] <nFFF> make sure you dont have scoping issues
[15:58:25] <MistuhKurtz> Something that worked like setTimeout except it chained jQuery methods would be cool
[15:58:32] <nFFF> and that addNewRow isn't in a function
[15:58:46] <james13433> how so?
[15:59:13] <james13433> oh sorry I thought that was a statement,
[15:59:20] <james13433> nFF it is a function :/
[15:59:29] <nFFF> that it isnt wrapped in a jQuery(function() of its own

[16:00:29] <freemind> nFFF, please take a look
[16:01:15] <james13433> whats the problem with it?
[16:01:16] <adamSs> steveoliver: confirmed
[16:01:18] <nFFF> freemind, sorry too tired to trawl through your site right now
[16:01:24] <nFFF> hopeuflly someone elsse can help

[16:01:34] <steveoliver> adamSs: weird?
[16:01:56] <james13433> Thanks fine for me in firefox
[16:02:00] <james13433> thats*
[16:02:20] <steveoliver> Currently everything is enabled I need for javascript, but I've tested all the way down to NO js loaded on the page at all, and still it happens
[16:02:35] <steveoliver> freakin' weird
[16:03:44] <steveoliver> no Console errors, no problems in other browsers....
[16:03:52] <steveoliver> drivin' me nuts :)
[16:04:23] <james13433> I wanna see the problem now, it when you hover your mouse over Make right?
[16:04:27] <adamSs> yea works fine in IE
[16:04:40] <steveoliver> when you hover your mouse over Makes list
[16:04:45] <steveoliver> Make: list
[16:06:09] <steveoliver> so question 1: anyone know how to fix this (and of course what the heck the bug even IS)?  and question 2: since i'm posting this in #jquery, any approach anyone would take even to hack at this behavior? (not preferred, of course)
[16:07:21] <hacks> how do I animate back to the css stylesheet's width and height of an element?
[16:09:52] <steveoliver> hacks: you'd have to save the width of the element as rendered originally, before your implied first transition.
[16:10:44] <steveoliver> And by "save" I don't know exactly how, I'm sure some experienced jquery/js person could probably give a little direction
[16:10:56] <steveoliver> (that's my initial thought)
[16:12:17] <Innocentus> hi
[16:16:27] <james13433>  well steveoliver its a css problem

[16:18:18] * steveoliver inspects <select> and <option> element Computed style in Firefox....
[16:18:44] <james13433> more specifically
[16:19:26] <james13433> nclg.wizard.css content:"*" I think
[16:20:06] <steveoliver> james13433: u are right -- u da man .  thanks
[16:20:11] <james13433> removing that fixes the problem anyways, but not sure what that code did in the first place so.
[16:20:45] <james13433> haha got my laptop out especially for that, I love a challenge ha
[16:21:00] <steveoliver> it added the red asterisk
[16:21:12] <steveoliver> thanks again :)
[16:22:19] <james13433> whats red asterisk, its not the one next to the label
[16:24:24] <Innocentus> I found it out: substract the offset of container from offset of child: child.offset().left - parent.offset().left
[16:24:32] <Innocentus> this will compensate any scrollOffset
[16:24:34] <steveoliver> you're also right about that -- that code was possibly going to replace the one rendered now
[16:25:04] <Innocentus> (of course the parent also needs to be scrolled together with its children)
[16:26:09] <james13433> Innocentus, did you even ask a question?
[16:36:35] <vacho> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-form
[16:36:49] <vacho> how come I don't find the actual form submission in that example? I want to know how I would go about submitting a modal form
[16:36:55] <ZeuZ> I'm trying to change the name of a dynamically added button, but using .attr('name','new name'); isn't working (although it isn't erroring either)
[16:37:12] <ZeuZ> Ideas?
[16:41:48] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/cmeWB6ghttp://pastebin.com/cmeWB6g2
[16:42:03] <vacho> can someone take a look there and tell me why my form is not submiting?
[16:43:40] <vacho> does a form have to have a submit button?
[16:44:08] <beancurd> how else would you submit a form?
[16:45:12] <alexr2> beancurd, through javascript?
[16:45:23] <alexr2> form.submit()
[16:45:23] <ZeuZ> I'm trying to change the name of a dynamically added button, but using .attr('name','new name'); isn't working (although it isn't erroring either).. Ideas?
[16:47:57] <vacho> ajpiano: ! :)
[16:51:17] <vacho> any gurus here? need help  http://pastebin.com/cmeWB6g2 .. form is not triggering the submit.
[16:51:54] <alexr2> vacho, that's really more of a #jquery-ui issue than a jquery issue
[16:52:14] <hacks> How can I trigger the dropout event within the drop event on a droppable ui element?
[16:52:39] <vacho> alexr2: are you kidding?
[16:52:41] <hacks> drop: function(ev, ui) { $(this).trigger('dropout'); ... }, ... no worky
[16:52:59] <alexr2> vacho... why would i be kidding?
[16:53:03] <vacho> alexr2: ppl put difference in that?
[16:53:07] <alexr2> it's a jquery ui plugin that you're using
[16:53:10] <alexr2> jquery != jquery-ui
[16:53:23] <alexr2> jquery ui is like any other set of plugins
[16:53:29] <vacho> it's made by the jquery team
[16:53:42] <alexr2> most people in this channel that help out aren't part of the jquery team
[16:53:52] <alexr2> we don't all know jquery-ui
[16:54:07] <alexr2> people in jquery-ui are much more likely to know the ins and outs of dialog than the people here
[16:54:12] <vacho> ofc..
[16:54:37] <vacho> but this channel has >300 users .. while jquery-ui has like 5 ... where do you think I will get my question answered?
[16:54:41] <vacho> jquery ui = jquery
[16:54:48] <vacho> any other plugin != jquery
[16:54:49] <alexr2> #jqueryui != #jquery-ui
[16:55:10] <alexr2> vacho... okay, don't bother listening... keep on asking here to people who aren't answering you
[16:55:46] <vacho> alexr2: I am listening.
[16:56:08] <vacho> alexr2: I understand what you are saying, I just don't agree with that jquery channel does not support jquery-ui
[16:56:38] <vacho> besides, my question has to do with ajax and live functions, which is jquery core.
[16:56:47] <alexr2> that's like going to the linux channel instead of the ubuntu channel for an ubuntu question
[16:57:01] <alexr2> yes, they probably know something about ubuntu, but you're much more likely to get a direct answer in the ubuntu channel
[16:57:03] <vacho> alexr2: exacly.. it is.
[16:57:35] <vacho> alexr2: it's like having a question about core linux command as a ubuntu user and asking in #linux .. im sure ppl will happily answer
[16:57:44] <vacho> alexr2: true!!
[16:57:55] <vacho> alexr2: but jquery-ui is a dead channel..there is no activity.
[16:57:59] <xp_prg> how do I know if I am in a hidden jquery ui tab?
[16:58:08] <hacks> does $ele.trigger('dropout') work for jquery ui's droppable events?
[16:58:09] <vacho> xp_prg: :)
[16:58:21] <xp_prg> can I use .closest?
[16:58:23] <vacho> alexr2: see, two ppl just asked UI related questions.
[16:58:42] <alexr2> vacho, have they gotten answers?
[16:58:45] <vacho> alexr2: in addition, I just asked in jquery-ui and no answer.
[16:59:05] <vacho> alexr2: dude, get back to work or something ..

[17:11:58] <krazyj> any thoughts on how i'd select an input with a specific 'name' attribute?

[17:13:51] <krazyj> no need for input[name...?
[17:19:01] <xp_prg> I am inside of a call fnServerData in jquery DataTables and I want to know if I am inside of a hiddent jquery ui tab, any ideas how I can do that?
[17:19:05] <xp_prg> can I use this or something?
[17:20:16] <coldhead> if ($(this).closest('.whateverClassTabsGet').is(':hidden'))
[17:20:22] <coldhead> ?closest
[17:20:22] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[17:20:46] <coldhead> that's dependent on `this` being something sensible
[17:20:49] <shoky> Goopyo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/75Fwh/1/
[17:22:17] <ZeuZ> krazyj, nope, you can refer to it like that, sorry ,I was away
[17:22:24] <krazyj> ZeuZ: thanks :)
[17:23:08] <xp_prg> coldhead I am inside of the callback fnServerData and I try this:  alert('closest div id: ' + $(this).closest('div').id);
[17:23:12] <xp_prg> it says undefined
[17:23:20] <xp_prg> I am confused by this
[17:23:26] <xp_prg> it is definitely inside of a div
[17:23:32] <coldhead> i am confused by your using alert
[17:23:41] <xp_prg> instead of console.log?
[17:23:53] <coldhead> try console.log(this, $(this), $(this).closest('etc'))
[17:24:01] <coldhead> and you'll see exactly what's what
[17:24:07] <xp_prg> coldhead ok
[17:24:18] <krazyj> is this considered a 'unique' ID/element, if i have multiple of them on the page, but within different parents? .name-and-price-container#2
[17:24:19] <ZeuZ> shouldn't he use attr('id')¿?
[17:24:29] <coldhead> ZeuZ: probably
[17:24:49] <shoky> Goopyo or even better: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/75Fwh/2/
[17:24:56] <krazyj> .name-and-price-container#1, .name-and-price-container#2, .name-and-price-container#3â€¦ but within different parents
[17:24:57] <shoky> preload the 'loading' gif
[17:24:59] <ZeuZ> krazyj, in that case, I would .find() them inside the different parents for them to be sent
[17:25:13] <krazyj> ZeuZ: ok. but that's an OK naming scheme/architecture?
[17:25:19] <krazyj> i know IDs aren't supposed to be duplicated on the page, i thought
[17:25:35] <ZeuZ> It's damn right :)
[17:25:42] <ZeuZ> ID's shouldn't duplicate
[17:25:56] <ZeuZ> and it's a good scheme.
[17:25:59] <krazyj> well, i might have 2x '.name-and-price-container#2'
[17:26:02] <krazyj> is tha tok?
[17:26:12] <ZeuZ> A precept of algebra says that no order is a bad order
[17:26:19] <coldhead> you can't start IDs with a number
[17:26:25] <ZeuZ> (meaning any order is good)
[17:26:28] <coldhead> so its not okay on several levels
[17:26:29] <krazyj> coldhead: oh really?
[17:26:54] <krazyj> coldhead: so it wouldn't be OK to have 2x .name-and-price-container#2 but within different parents?
[17:27:07] <krazyj> er, .name-and-price-container#e2
[17:27:21] <coldhead> you'd be off the team if you tried that on my project
[17:27:48] <coldhead> just make your IDs unique and valid
[17:27:51] <coldhead> and everything will be fine
[17:27:52] <Goopyo> shoky: I keep getting a syntax error on it and cant find it
[17:27:55] <Goopyo> can you confirm?
[17:28:10] <coldhead> ?g jshint @ Goopyo
[17:28:11] <bot-t> Goopyo, JSHint, A JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://jshint.com/
[17:28:18] <krazyj> coldhead: ok.. any thought on how to name elements on a page that are in different categories, and duplicated many times within those categories
[17:28:30] <coldhead> use classes
[17:28:32] <coldhead> not IDs
[17:28:44] <krazyj> i.e. i'll have Coffee: Drip, French Press / Beer: IPA, Lager
[17:28:46] <shoky> Goopyo: i'm not getting any error
[17:29:03] <krazyj> coldhead: coffee/beer are categories. drip, french press, ipa, lager are items.
[17:29:09] <krazyj> but i need to uniquely identify all of them
[17:29:51] <Goopyo> shoky: hmm that jshint thing is showing it, on line 15 unexpected ;
[17:29:55] <Goopyo> last line
[17:29:57] <krazyj> any thoughts?
[17:30:20] <shoky> Goopyo: fuck jshint ?
[17:30:27] <shoky> jslint?
[17:30:30] <Goopyo> lol chrome wont load it, http://www.jshint.com/reports/488001
[17:30:50] <shoky> what?
[17:30:54] <xp_prg> ok coldhead I figured it out, I was in a function(json) callback on $.post, if I am outside of that I can see I am not visible, is there a way to pass a variable to $.post besides using the window.globa_var approach?
[17:31:33] <coldhead> make it a local variable in a containing function
[17:31:47] <coldhead> and it should be available within code within .post()
[17:32:00] <coldhead> krazyj: i'll do you a demo
[17:32:02] <coldhead> please hold
[17:32:11] <xp_prg> ok thanks coldhead
[17:32:14] <xp_prg> I will try it :>

[17:40:19] <bkeating> is it possible to load/insert html into a document via jQuery? namely an iframeâ€¦. I don't want to load it unless a user requests it.

[17:41:03] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[17:42:08] <bkeating> w00t. thanks coldhead, learned two new things.
[17:42:25] <krazyj> coldhead: the only prob is, in my app, i don't have unique categories. its a user-modifiable property
[17:42:36] <krazyj> so i'm building this attribute hierarchy with generic names
[17:42:38] <ragnok> feeding bots...tss
[17:42:43] <krazyj> and categories and items are defined by the user
[17:44:11] <coldhead> krazyj: in that case i would generate unique classnames for them
[17:44:17] <coldhead> .type79 or whatever
[17:44:26] <coldhead> and the user would never need to see them
[17:44:33] <krazyj> coldhead: why that, instead of id names?
[17:45:01] <coldhead> because i'm not sure you have a good enough grip of IDs
[17:45:09] <coldhead> classes are safer
[17:45:19] <krazyj> eh i do.. just not chaining them ;)
[17:45:28] <coldhead> if this stuff is getting stored in a db, you can just use the IDs
[17:45:36] <coldhead> with a prefix so they don't start with a number
[17:45:42] <coldhead> #id_777
[17:45:45] <coldhead> or w/e
[17:45:49] <coldhead> then you don't gotta chain
[17:46:23] <krazyj> cool
[17:46:26] <krazyj> thanks coldhead :)
[17:46:34] <coldhead> good luck buddy!
[17:46:56] <hacks> $('[title]'); is that slow?
[17:47:12] <coldhead> yes
[17:47:31] <coldhead> it has to selec EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT first and then check whether they have a title
[17:47:59] <coldhead> a[title] is somewhat faster
[17:48:02] <coldhead> if you can manage that
[17:50:23] <bkeating> does .load() only accept local files?
[17:51:03] <coldhead> the file has to be on the same domain
[17:51:21] <coldhead> if you want to load content from another domain you have to use jsonp
[17:51:30] <coldhead> assuming they provide that

[18:29:19] <MrBar> how to get in (ui-draggable event) handle that in use
[18:29:30] <jamthyme> hello. i'm a little confused about how jQuery.data() works. if i make a call to data() and store the return value in a var, can i just change the var and the data will change too? or do i need to explicitly set data() again? i'm looking at the source but i just can't figure it out
[18:32:13] <MrBar> jamthyme: that depend on value
[18:34:10] <jamthyme> i'm just using an object literal
[18:35:09] <MrBar> wtf object literal?
[18:35:17] <jamthyme> or rather, $(elment).data( "myplugin", {...}) sorry
[18:36:08] <jamthyme> if i then do var data = $(element).data("myplugin") can i just change data and have it reflect in the next call to $(element).data("myplugin")?
[18:36:27] <MrBar> if value is object u can modify it in place
[18:36:43] <jamthyme> great thanks :)
[18:38:32] <MrBar> but if u set later  data = some;  this not set data()
[18:39:26] <jamthyme> you mean outside of the function data is declared in?
[18:40:07] <MrBar> no, inside

[20:03:18] <beancurd> I LIKE BERKS!
[20:03:26] <beancurd> <_^
[20:11:46] <luvmyh0nda> so, it has come to my attention that there is no menubar in m7
[20:12:02] <ManxPower> I tried using $('selector').each() to .show() each row in a 2,000 row table.  This is rather slow.  Does anyone have ideas for doing it faster without shrinking the size of the table?
[20:13:53] <luvmyh0nda> $('#parent').find('tr').show();
[20:14:45] <luvmyh0nda> er
[20:14:59] <luvmyh0nda> $('#parent tr').show();
[20:15:26] <ManxPower> I just tried that, it is also slow. 8-(
[20:15:35] <luvmyh0nda> try
[20:15:51] <ManxPower> I did.  I realized that was something I could do after I posted the question.
[20:15:54] <danzik171> ManxPower: try this:   $( "selector" ).detach().show().appendTo( yourcontainer )
[20:16:06] <luvmyh0nda> $('#'+tableid).find('tr').each(function(){$(this).show()});
[20:17:24] <ManxPower> danzik171: What would "my container" be?  I'm a bit of a n00b still.
[20:17:49] <danzik171> ManxPower: if these are table rows, then the container is your tbody or table depending on your markup
[20:18:21] <ManxPower> danzik171: and my selector would be a selector for the rows, correct?
[20:18:29] <danzik171> ManxPower: correct
[20:19:22] <luvmyh0nda> how can I tell why an event is not firing?
[20:20:25] <ManxPower> both my each method and luvmyh0nda's method took about 7 seconds.  danzik171's method takes about 1 second.
[20:20:34] <ManxPower> luvmyh0nda's original method
[20:21:34] <luvmyh0nda> my method worked?
[20:21:38] <danzik171> luvmyh0nda: you'd need to provide some example code - thats a bit too broad of a question
[20:22:07] <ManxPower> luvmyh0nda: both of your methods worked, both took about 7 seconds.
[20:22:33] <ManxPower> danzik171: do you have a moment to explain your method?  I don't understand it at all.
[20:22:52] <ManxPower> It works, which is great, but I'd like understand it.
[20:23:27] <danzik171> ManxPower: it's pretty simple - internally, .show() is just an .each look that's modifying each element individually.  that causes 2000 page reflows which is why it was so slow
[20:23:43] <ManxPower> danzik171:  *nod*
[20:23:57] <danzik171> ManxPower: using my method, you're modifying the elements' styles when they are not in the DOM, therefore there are 0 reflows.  there's only 1 reflow when you re-attach the fragment
[20:24:35] <ManxPower> danzik171: The appendTo reattaches?
[20:25:28] <danzik171> ManxPower: yup.  or append does, or prepend, or any of the other manipulation methods
[20:25:33] <ManxPower> It is generally a good idea to detatch elements if you are modifying a large number of them if it might cause a page reflow?
[20:25:51] <luvmyh0nda> http://jsfiddle.net/m5Ayc/
[20:26:18] <danzik171> ManxPower: yes - it's almost always a good idea unless detaching the elements would somehow detract from the user experience, but in that case you probably need to re-think your design anyway
[20:27:00] <ManxPower> danzik171: *nod*  I would normally keep the number of rows manageable and filter on the server side, but it seemed silly for my specific need in this case.
[20:27:12] <ManxPower> danzik171: thanks for your help.
[20:27:18] <ManxPower> luvmyh0nda: thanks for your help as well.
[20:27:45] <luvmyh0nda> no prob, thanks to danzik171 as well
[20:28:23] <danzik171> luvmyh0nda: there's an error in that code since your menubar plugin isn't included, but don't use inline handlers like onclick
[20:28:45] <danzik171> use jQuery events to handle those
[20:29:43] <luvmyh0nda> the menu is built dynamically
[20:30:04] <systemfault> Then use event delegation...
[20:30:45] <tash> I'm not really sure if this is a jq question, but can someone point me in the right direction?  I've got 3 date columns in a table that I want to be sortable by clicking on the <th>, in this case Start, Complete, Finished.
[20:31:15] <danzik171> luvmyh0nda: pretty much what systemfault said.  see ?on
[20:31:15] <bot-t> luvmyh0nda, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:31:53] <systemfault> Adding event delegation to .on was a bad idea :/
[20:31:59] <systemfault> It confuses people...
[20:32:18] <danzik171> systemfault: +1 .  i suggest it since it's "preferred" but tbh i still use delegate....like the name and syntax better.
[20:33:07] <systemfault> danzik171: I use .on but can't help but think that .delegate was the best name (.live sucked)
[20:35:36] <nitesh> Hi
[20:35:51] <nitesh> I have problem with jquery mobile dialog
[20:36:01] <nitesh> similar to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5932145/how-to-get-return-value-from-jquerymobile-dialog
[21:26:22] <nights> how can i reliably communicate a variable across different jquery requests?
[21:26:26] <nights> im using session variables now, and it doesnt work always
[21:29:15] <Cork> nights: well if the page is reloaded, you have no choice
[21:29:29] <Cork> nights: if its ajax, just store the value in js and set it as a param
[21:30:12] <dns-away> Hello, anyone can help me with it, http://jsfiddle.net/nYKp2/
[21:34:53] <Cork> dns-away: what are you trying to do?
[21:35:17] <kakarlus|bz> hi gusys
[21:35:19] <kakarlus|bz> need guidance
[21:35:30] <kakarlus|bz> doesnt work -- $('#draggable').css('left', lastItem.x+'px');
[21:35:32] <systemfault> Go left!
[21:35:44] <kakarlus|bz> but this works -- $('#draggable').css('left', '100px');
[21:35:53] <kakarlus|bz> why?
[21:36:00] <Cork> kakarlus|bz: and lastItem.x is 100 ?
[21:36:09] <kakarlus|bz> Cork: yes
[21:36:24] <Cork> it should work then
[21:36:35] <kakarlus|bz> i also tried var leftStr = lastItem.x+'px';
[21:36:42] <kakarlus|bz> and put leftStr in the css()
[21:36:45] <kakarlus|bz> doesnt work
[21:36:47] <kakarlus|bz> :s
[21:36:49] <kakarlus|bz> so strange
[21:37:06] <Cork> sounds like your getting something else from that concat
[21:37:34] <kakarlus|bz> by any chance, does css not accept decimal values?
[21:37:47] <kakarlus|bz> coz sometimes lastItem.x has a decimal value
[21:40:07] <Wildbat> [Q], can anyone help me with validate? i am trying to learn it but i can't seem to get it to work.... http://pastebin.com/n7y4uNZ6
[21:41:17] <Cork> kakarlus|bz: not sure, it doesn't make sence with sub pixels thought
[21:41:33] <dns-away> Cork, i have html with <div class="number">HERE_UNIX_TIMESTAMP</div> and function timeststampToTime() worked with with set interval for liveUpdates, and it work, but on inserBefore or Append it no work
[21:41:34] <Cork> kakarlus|bz: do a Math.floor or .round before you assign it
[21:43:07] <dns-away> function setInterval with function timeststampToTime() no work on Append/InsertBefore
[21:43:42] <Cork> dns-away: ya, but what is it your trying to do
[21:43:58] <Cork> dns-away: update each field by one every 3 sec?
[21:44:09] <dns-away> live time updates Example (5 seconds ago), on new comment
[21:44:09] <Cork> or combine them or what?
[21:44:25] <Cork> ok so each one on there own
[21:45:05] <dns-away> yes,
[21:45:41] <kakarlus|bz> i traced typeof(lastItem.x);
[21:45:43] <kakarlus|bz> its a string
[21:47:42] <Cork> dns-away: http://jsfiddle.net/nYKp2/1/
[21:47:56] <Cork> hmm actually
[21:48:17] <Cork> make it http://jsfiddle.net/nYKp2/2/
[21:48:18] <dns-away> Ok,i'll try with it :>
[21:54:09] <Cork> kakarlus|bz: checked around a bit, and yes fractions is valid even on px
[21:54:28] <Cork> kakarlus|bz: the number parser doesn't make any difference between px and any other format
[21:55:00] <Cork> some browsers will ignore it though, but thats another matter
[21:58:19] <kakarlus|bz> Cork solved already thanks - lastItem.x was a string and 'px' was in it already
[21:58:30] <kakarlus|bz> overlooked the px -_-
[21:58:31] <Cork> ah
[21:58:50] <Cork> ya, pxpx isn't a valid css value ;P
[21:59:10] <kakarlus|bz> haha took me 30mins lol
[22:02:38] <Wildbat> can anyone help me with validate? i am trying to learn it but i can't seem to get it to work.... http://jsfiddle.net/UtD8p/
[22:03:37] <Cork> Wildbat: 1. just use <!doctype html> no need for that long doctype
[22:03:55] <Cork> 2. jsfiddle takes the body html in the html block, not the entire html page
[22:06:06] <Wildbat> sorry i was copy form my html. but why the validation isn't working?
[22:11:57] <Cork> Wildbat: donno, from the documentation it looks like what your doing should work
[22:26:28] <iateadonut> if i'd like to bind a function to an element
[22:26:34] <iateadonut> bind('click', function() { ... something like this
[22:26:48] <iateadonut> but, i want to call a function defined outside?  can i do that?
[22:27:12] <iateadonut> like bind('click', functionName(var1, var2))
[22:27:15] <iateadonut> something like that?
[22:27:49] <Cork> Wildbat: your html is invalid
[22:27:59] <Cork> Wildbat: thats why the validator fails
[22:28:58] <Cork> Wildbat: http://jsfiddle.net/UtD8p/2/
[22:29:59] <Cork> iateadonut: bind('click', functionName)
[22:30:19] <Cork> if you want to pass extra parameters you need the anonymus function
[22:30:28] <Cork> (or the data section)
[22:32:10] <iateadonut> i see.  thanks.
[22:34:50] <Wildbat> Cork oh ! thanks Cork
[22:37:12] <Cork> Wildbat: so basically, change your doctype and run it through w3c's validator
[22:39:10] <Wildbat> Cork, thanks for the tip ^^
[22:53:59] <krazyj> hi allâ€¦ i have a submit button ID that i'm removing then simultaneously readding (via .after/.append) in its own .click() method. the readded button doesn't trigger .click() after thatâ€¦ any ideas?
[22:55:41] <Cork> krazyj: click binds on the element
[22:55:53] <Cork> krazyj: if you remove the element you remove the event listner
[22:56:07] <Cork> krazyj: you need to use a delegated event listner
[22:56:10] <Cork> ?.on
[22:56:11] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:56:19] <Cork> krazyj: check the delegate section on that page
[22:56:31] <krazyj> Cork: are you saying i need to delegate the click action to another function, entirely?
[22:56:39] <krazyj> since i can't remove it, inside of the click function
[22:57:11] <krazyj> â€¦.or readd the event listener at the end of .click()?
[22:57:30] <UberNinDude> hi
[22:58:09] <Cork> krazyj: you need to do one of two things, 1. bind the event listner as a delegated event listner on a parent that you don't remove (see link), or 2. rebind the listner
[22:58:23] <Cork> krazyj: or 3. use display: none instead of removing the element
[22:58:37] <krazyj> Cork: it's an ID elementâ€¦ 1 instance
[22:58:56] <Cork> krazyj: the id is just to let you select it
[22:59:07] <Cork> if you remove the element its gone
[22:59:23] <krazyj> sure, if i display:none, then the ID is in the DOM twice, right?
[22:59:36] <Cork> no
[22:59:44] <Cork> if you append the same element its just moved
[23:00:59] <krazyj> so doing display:none on one instance of an ID, then append the same element in some other element with the same ID doesn't cause problems? why?
[23:03:26] <Cork> krazyj: append to another element with the same id?
[23:03:47] <krazyj> yeah
[23:03:56] <krazyj> after setting display:none on the existing instance
[23:04:13] <krazyj> how does that work? there'd be two instance of the same ID in the DOM, no?
[23:04:30] <Cork> krazyj: your cloning the element?
[23:04:42] <krazyj> removing one instance -> appending it somewhere else
[23:04:52] <krazyj> on .click()
[23:05:11] <krazyj> hence, the desire to .remove() in .click() and keep it calling .click(), afterwards
[23:07:28] <krazyj> Cork:
[23:08:41] <krazyj> Cork: perhaps you could suggest how to rebind the new instance of that ID to the same function that's responding to .click()? i'm new here :)
[23:11:01] <Cork> ?p @ krazyj
[23:11:01] <bot-t> krazyj, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:11:16] <rwoverdijk> I'm trying to loop through a set of matched elements (example: $('.selector')) and then unset this element from the returned, matched elements. How would I do this? It's not an array so I can't use pop or shift.
[23:11:51] <Brodingo> ?not
[23:11:52] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[23:12:45] <krazyj> Cork: it's simpleâ€¦ https://gist.github.com/75371781f11bf8781a3a
[23:13:12] <rwoverdijk> Brodingo: not(:first) ?
[23:13:17] <krazyj> then, after .click() executes, i want #add-item-button - *the newly appended instance* - to respond with the same handler function
[23:13:33] <rwoverdijk> .not(':first')*
[23:15:25] <rwoverdijk> Ah, I think I need slice()
[23:16:09] <Whirl3d> .gt(0)
[23:20:26] <Cork> krazyj: i don't understand why you remove the old button
[23:20:44] <krazyj> Cork: it's a design decision
[23:20:49] <Cork> krazyj: just do $("#some-other-div").append($("#add-item-button"));
[23:20:59] <Cork> and it will work fine
[23:21:31] <Cork> krazyj: remember your working with dom, and not html
[23:21:31] <krazyj> Cork: any suggestions on other methods to do that? we have string-based partials driving this
[23:21:41] <krazyj> it's kinda hard to do that
[23:21:56] <krazyj> you mentioned rebiding?
[23:22:16] <Cork> krazyj: simplest and best solution would be to use delegated event listner
[23:22:29] <Cork> by far the most efficient solution
[23:22:37] <krazyj> Cork: what did you mention about having a different parent?
[23:22:58] <Cork> krazyj: you know about event bubbling?
[23:23:07] <krazyj> noâ€¦
[23:23:10] <krazyj> do i need to
[23:23:24] <Cork> ok, in dom events propagate from child to parent
[23:23:43] <Cork> so a parent gets all the events that happens on a child
[23:24:02] <Cork> krazyj: so you need to pick a parent to your button thats never replaced
[23:24:13] <Cork> and bind the delegated event listner on that one
[23:24:24] <Cork> and it will just work
[23:26:53] <FinalAngel> http://jsfiddle.net/jS5ER/2/ anyone an idea how to achieve this?
[23:28:31] <Cork> FinalAngel: the key eat?
[23:28:44] <FinalAngel> yay
[23:28:48] <Cork> ah, you mean the key valid from the test object?
[23:28:50] <FinalAngel> ah sry
[23:29:10] <FinalAngel> http://jsfiddle.net/jS5ER/3/ thats correct :p
[23:29:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/jS5ER/5/
[23:30:17] <Cork> ah sorry
[23:30:18] <Cork> one sec
[23:31:03] <FinalAngel> yay what happens if I create end: function() {} and call eat within, I'll get start instead of end
[23:31:07] <Cork> FinalAngel: and you want to always get the calling function?
[23:31:14] <FinalAngel> yep
[23:31:39] <Cork> you know callee is depricated in future js right?
[23:31:49] <FinalAngel> http://jsfiddle.net/jS5ER/6/
[23:31:53] <Cork> and thereby theres no way to do what you want
[23:32:09] <FinalAngel> yeah, but thats okay for now
[23:34:17] <raj> would e.preventDefault stop $('.myform').fileupload('send', {'url':'/submission'}) ?
[23:34:38] <coldhead> depends on how fileupload works
[23:34:47] <Cork> FinalAngel: and callee points to the called function
[23:34:52] <Cork> FinalAngel: not the calling one
[23:34:59] <raj> hmm
[23:35:12] <raj> cuz if I don't have that, it goes to /submission
[23:35:14] <FinalAngel> I know, thats why I don't know how I could achieve this
[23:35:23] <raj> even though the form has POST
[23:35:52] <Cork> FinalAngel: the calling function is caller, though its even more depricated then callee
[23:36:18] <Cork> ?mdc arguments.caller
[23:36:22] <bot-t> Cork, caller - MDN - Specifies the function that invoked the currently executing function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments/caller
[23:37:50] <Cork> FinalAngel: hmm actually this looks farly ok http://jsfiddle.net/jS5ER/7/
[23:39:20] <iateadonut> if i've got some html, and then a json_encoded string coming back from ajax, how do i get that json_encoded string to show up as a variable?
[23:39:34] <iateadonut> (i was trying to use split to split the two strings)
[23:39:42] <iateadonut> (which come back as one string with a delimiter
[23:41:05] <Cork> iateadonut: you would have to grab just the json string and then parse it
[23:42:40] <iateadonut> ah!
[23:42:41] <iateadonut> parsing it.
[23:42:47] <iateadonut> totally forgot.  thanks.
[23:42:50] <iateadonut> ummm...
[23:43:01] <iateadonut> like $.parseJSON, i think.
[23:43:05] <iateadonut> i'll look it up.  thanks.
[23:43:12] <Cork> or JSON.parse() ya
[23:44:24] <zion> Hey guys, I am having an issue using the jQuery UI. Specifically the tabs. For some reason it seems to select the last tab when it loads.
[23:45:05] <zion> Any ideas?
[23:45:33] <zion> $('#content').tabs('select', 'tabs-1');
[23:48:56] <iateadonut> i'm alerting the JSON string before it's parsed: it should look like this, right: [[0,117],[1,132],[2,142],[3,132],[4,139],[5,156],[6,92]]
[23:49:36] <coldhead> ?g jsonlint
[23:49:37] <bot-t> coldhead, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[23:49:51] <coldhead> it isn't json unless that site says its json
[23:50:55] <iateadonut> it says valid JSON - the thing is after i parseJSON, and alert the value, this shows up: 0,117,1,132,2,142,3,132, instead of Object()
[23:51:16] <chnopsies> I'm trying to position (using the 'top' css property) a position:fixed element before showing it with .fadeIn(), but it seems like setting 'top' has no effect on an invisible element when it is made visible with fadeIn() later. I've tried making the element visible with show() and setting 'opacity' to 0 to position the element before fadeIn() makes it visible, but explicitly setting opacity:0 seems to make fadeIn() not work at all (i
[23:51:16] <chnopsies> t'll just stay invisible)
[23:51:55] <Whirl3d> when firing a callback created by attaching an event to a deferred's promise, is the context of the callback changed so that "this" is the item resolved with deferred.resolveWith(itm) or do you have to have a paramter in your callback which itm is applied to like promise.then(function (el) {do something}, function (el) {fail at soething})?
[23:51:56] <chnopsies> is there some other way of doing this? (this == vertically centering a modal popup before fading it in)
[23:52:16] <Whirl3d> *attaching a handler not an event
[23:52:40] <iateadonut> alert( $.parseJSON(data2[1]) );  is what i'm doing... alert(data2[1]) show up: [[0,117],[1,132],[2,142],[3,132]]... alert($.parseJSON(data2[1])); shows up: 0,117,1,132,2,142,3,132, when i think it should show up as "object()"
[23:52:46] <krazyj> weirdâ€¦ i'm binding two different sets of IDs to 'keyup' in a .click() and, for some reason, the first binding rebinds to the second binding, if i don't type in the first binding before the second binding
[23:55:09] <krazyj> any thoughts?
[23:55:27] <coldhead> ?p @ krazyj
[23:55:27] <bot-t> krazyj, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:55:37] <krazyj> way too much code to pasteâ€¦ no ideas? :D
[23:55:37] <coldhead> you're almost certainly doing it weirdly
[23:55:54] <coldhead> one idea might be to write cleaner code :D
[23:56:19] <Whirl3d> krazyj, do you have any ideas about how my recursive loader could work better?
[23:56:33] <krazyj> Whirl3d: nope, i'm new here
[23:56:49] <krazyj> coldhead: if you insist....
[23:56:50] <Whirl3d> nope, becuase you have no idea what my code looks like. Get the picture

[23:57:17] <krazyj> i click #add-item-button twice
[23:57:34] <chnopsies> I figed my problem by just making the whole thing visible real quick, setting position, the immediately hiding again, before finally calling fadeIn(), a bit hacky, but seems to work
[23:57:36] <chnopsies> fixed*
[23:57:43] <krazyj> item-name-input-2-1 binds to item-2-1
[23:57:47] <krazyj> hit #add-item-button again
[23:57:55] <krazyj> item-name-input-3-1 binds to item-3-1
[23:58:09] <krazyj> however, if i go back and type in item-name-input-2-1, it modifies item-3-1, not item-2-1
[23:59:26] <coldhead> krazyj: you don't seem to be using var variable_name;
[23:59:32] <coldhead> so these vars would be global
[23:59:37] <Whirl3d> krazyj, you really need to take Cork's advice.
[23:59:38] <krazyj> correct
[23:59:39] <coldhead> and shared everywhere
[23:59:50] <coldhead> wait, Cork gave advice?
[23:59:55] <coldhead> i'm wasting my time
[23:59:58] <coldhead> do whatever Cork says
