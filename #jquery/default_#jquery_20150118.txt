[00:53:44] <Redeemer> hi!
[00:57:22] <Redeemer> (function($){})(jQuery)
[01:37:33] <k_89> well, shameless plug : http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2sti4f/mapmyp_you_havent_really_been_there_unless_you/
[03:38:35] <brutzelspeck> hello
[03:38:41] <arthurvr> hi!
[03:40:01] <brutzelspeck> is there a way to select elements by attribute name in safari? $(someElementFromVariable).find('[data-group="1"]'); does not work
[03:42:58] <arthurvr> brutzelspeck: jsfiddle would be handy, but yes that normally works
[03:56:07] <smart_ptr> hi
[03:56:16] <smart_ptr> why doesn't this work at youtube.com? http://pastie.org/9838159
[03:56:29] <smart_ptr> i use chrome; did they explicitly block any jquery modification?
[03:57:02] <smart_ptr> so player-api returns a valid jquery object, yet i cannot modify the width :O
[03:58:14] <smart_ptr> https://www.dropbox.com/s/55v7zn25siovaef/Screenshot%202015-01-18%2012.58.17.png?dl=0
[04:01:04] <smart_ptr> do you have any idea what's going on there?
[04:04:12] <bacobart> i don't think youtube is using jquery
[04:06:09] <bacobart> console.log($("#player-api").jquery)
[04:06:12] <bacobart> returns undefined
[04:06:24] <bacobart> it should return the jquery version if they were actually using that
[04:06:24] <smart_ptr> oh, oh! I thought the fact that [1] printed something okay was already "proof" of it using jquery
[04:06:29] <bacobart> no:P
[04:06:34] <smart_ptr> yep, you're right ;D
[04:17:51] <arthurvr> smart_ptr: bacobart: the thing is that $ is as well an alias for document.getElementById, as of the command line API
[04:18:38] <arthurvr> see https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Command_Line_API
[04:18:53] <arthurvr> so jQuery normally overwrites that
[04:18:58] <arthurvr> $ is a global on every page
[04:39:30] <smart_ptr> arthurvr: ok!
[05:01:01] <new_> hello people
[05:01:14] <arthurvr> hello new_ !
[05:01:14] <new_> how do I make sure the $.get() function gets called automatically?
[05:01:37] <arthurvr> what do you mean with ‚Äùgets called automatically‚Äù?
[05:01:43] <arthurvr> maybe jsfiddle to make it clear
[05:01:56] <new_> Like without clicking on a button
[05:02:17] <arthurvr> just execute it‚Ä¶
[05:02:25] <arthurvr> just call it I mean
[05:02:32] <new_> $.get( "/getUsername", function( data ) {             $( "#welcomeUsername" ).append( data );             alert( "Load was performed with data: "+data );         });
[05:02:36] <new_> i put it like this
[05:02:47] <arthurvr> yeah
[05:02:48] <new_> but it doesn't fire off :(
[05:03:08] <arthurvr> well than that‚Äôs a problem with /getUsername
[05:03:21] <new_> ohh I see...
[05:03:29] <new_> so you mean my backend isn't configured well?
[05:03:36] <arthurvr> probably yees
[05:03:55] <arthurvr> the callback fires when the server resp ends
[05:04:34] <new_> oh okay
[05:05:03] <arthurvr> new_: is it throwing anything in the console?
[05:05:05] <new_> app.get('/getUsername', function(req, res){ res.send(username); }
[05:05:10] <new_> this is my backend
[05:05:24] <arthurvr> but no res.end() ?
[05:05:27] <new_> yeah nothing prints on the console
[05:05:41] <arthurvr> app.get('/getUsername', function(req, res){ res.end(username); }
[05:05:57] <arthurvr> the response is never ending this way
[05:06:10] <new_> well I did put a console.message("hfeaw"); just to see if it even reaches here.... but it doesn't.
[05:06:27] <arthurvr> console.message? you must mean console.log?
[05:06:37] <new_> oh yea sorry
[05:07:01] <arthurvr> yeah but as long as the response doesn‚Äôt end, the callback doesn‚Äôt get executed
[05:07:02] <new_> okay I tried the res.end it's not working either
[05:07:17] <new_> no I mean I put the console.log in the backend
[05:07:33] <new_> app.get('/getUsername', function(req, res){  console.log("HELLO"); res.end(username); }
[05:07:35] <arthurvr> oh but I mean the browser console
[05:07:49] <arthurvr> yeah then it‚Äôs a problem with your frontend
[05:07:55] <arthurvr> jsfiddle man
[05:07:56] <new_> yeah exactly
[05:08:23] <new_> I maybe wrong but does $get() function fire off without any submit button?
[05:08:50] <arthurvr> $.get just makes a get request when it gets called
[05:09:19] <new_> okay
[05:10:02] <new_> well it doesn't seem to be working...
[05:10:15] <new_> what do you suggest I do?
[05:10:35] <arthurvr> jsfiddle, really hard to figure stuff like this out. Might be a backend problem as well
[05:11:59] <new_> Ohhhh okay
[05:12:48] <new_> http://jsfiddle.net/kfmow0ee/
[05:13:14] <new_> this is the first time I've done it I hope it's right
[05:13:43] <arthurvr> yah but this isn‚Äôt a reduced testcase
[05:13:52] <arthurvr> jsfiddle has no /getUsername :)
[05:14:36] <arthurvr> but the code looks okay, so is a backend problem
[05:14:55] <new_> wait what did you mean by "jsfiddle has no /getusername"?
[05:15:17] <arthurvr> that that code will never work on jsfiddle
[05:15:28] <new_> oh right
[05:15:34] <arthurvr> because jsfiddle just returns 404 on /getUsername
[05:15:39] <new_> btw /getUsername doesn't have to be an html page right?
[05:15:55] <arthurvr> no
[05:15:57] <arthurvr> can be anything
[05:16:04] <arthurvr> json is most used format
[05:16:04] <new_> I'm using it as a way of identifying what kind of request client is asking for. Is that a right way to do things?
[05:16:42] <arthurvr> what do you mean with ‚Äùa way of identifying what kind of request client‚Äù?
[05:17:05] <new_> Like in this case the client is asking for a username
[05:17:25] <new_> so I will identify the specific code in my backend that provides the username and deliver it
[05:17:30] <arthurvr> oh that way you mean, yes that‚Äôs the way to use it
[05:17:45] <new_> okaay
[05:18:21] <new_> can I find a JSON tutorial of doing this?
[05:18:38] <arthurvr> it‚Äôs as easy as letting your server return json
[05:18:45] <arthurvr> and parsing it using jQuery.parseJSON
[05:18:46] <new_> if so, what do I search for? XD
[05:19:02] <arthurvr> `api getJSON
[05:19:03] <b-ot> arthurvr: No matches.
[05:19:14] <new_> ohhkay
[05:19:25] <arthurvr> `api $.getJSON
[05:19:25] <b-ot> arthurvr: No matches.
[05:19:27] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[05:19:48] <new_> thanks!
[05:20:32] <arthurvr> and in general this might be handy on your backend then: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[05:22:24] <new_> okay
[05:22:28] <new_> OH BTW
[05:22:31] <new_> ARTHUR
[05:22:35] <new_> I figured it out
[05:22:43] <new_> I've been stuck at this for the past 2 hours
[05:22:52] <arthurvr> new_: good to hear that :)
[05:23:08] <new_> Guess what was wrong? I forgot to include the jquery CDN thingy lol
[05:23:22] <arthurvr> really?
[05:23:24] <arthurvr> oh man
[05:23:36] <arthurvr> quite an important thing, haha
[05:23:36] <new_> yeah I'm probably the biggest noob developer
[05:23:48] <arthurvr> new_: you‚Äôre welcome!
[05:23:57] <new_> yeah
[05:24:01] <new_> bye :)
[05:24:12] <arthurvr> new_: use good boilerplate tooling, so you don‚Äôt forget this kind of things :√†
[05:24:15] <arthurvr> :)
[05:24:22] <new_> ooo okay
[05:24:32] <new_> I learnt a lot
[05:31:09] <libracious> okkk

[06:46:52] <printForever> looking for some help with breaking HTML code into two parts
[06:46:52] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/fY83bsuY
[06:47:16] <printForever> you have to see the link to understand what I'm trying to do
[06:50:08] <MeiR-> printForever, how do you plan to determine where to break the code?
[06:51:01] <MeiR-> you should have some indication inside the div content
[06:51:09] <printForever> the div contains HMTL with multiple DIV's inside of him
[06:51:16] <printForever> so I know where to break
[06:51:33] <MeiR-> that's not what you showed in your pastebin
[06:51:37] <printForever> I just need to know how
[06:51:45] <printForever> I wrote HTMLHTMLHTMLHTMLHTMLHTML
[06:52:13] <printForever> I'm looking for a principle, not a copy/paste example
[06:52:27] <printForever> *copy/paste solution, that is
[06:52:34] <MeiR-> maybe you can use .insertAfter
[06:52:36] <MeiR-> http://api.jquery.com/insertafter/
[06:52:48] <printForever> no, I cant, because I need to split the div, not insert after
[06:53:20] <MeiR-> you got me confused
[06:53:35] <MeiR-> you said the div content has multiple divs
[06:53:40] <printForever> yes
[06:53:56] <MeiR-> and you should insert the "injection" between them somewhere
[06:53:59] <MeiR-> is that right?
[06:54:14] <printForever> and multiple inner divs will help me to determine the injection location
[06:54:26] <printForever> but still I have to SPLIT the wrapper div
[06:54:35] <printForever> its basically
[06:54:37] <MeiR-> do these divs have unique id or class?
[06:54:41] <printForever> yes
[06:55:16] <printForever> MeiR- I want to break 960px DIV and split it in two 960px DIV's, and add in between one 1 100% width DIV
[06:55:21] <printForever> do you get it now?
[06:56:41] <MeiR-> then store the $(".wrapper").html() in some variable
[06:56:52] <printForever> I tried appending </div> before my new content and <div> after my new content, in hope that it will SPLIT the DIV in two
[06:56:54] <MeiR-> then manipulate the splitting
[06:56:55] <printForever> but it did nothing
[06:57:06] <printForever> ok, cool
[06:57:09] <MeiR-> and then remove the original ".wrapper"
[06:57:20] <MeiR-> and append the created ones
[06:57:29] <printForever> short example?
[06:59:40] <MeiR-> you'll have to wait a bit for that
[07:00:52] <printForever> ok
[07:06:21] <printForever> MeiR- not to press you or anything, but could you let me know a possible ETA?
[07:06:50] <MeiR-> i'm in a phone call
[07:06:59] <printForever> lol, ok
[07:07:01] <MeiR-> can take 5 more minutes
[07:07:09] <printForever> no problem
[07:14:33] <MeiR-> ok printForever, i'm with u
[07:14:38] <MeiR-> let me create a fiddle
[07:14:47] <printForever> k, tnx
[07:48:32] <printForever> anything?
[08:01:24] <aro> when a form submit is caught using $.on('submit') - is there a way to catch what button was pressed to submit it?
[08:02:27] <printForever> MeiR- dude?
[08:07:40] <printForever> what an a$$ of a man...
[09:22:33] <mty> can someone help-me?
[09:25:28] <Harry> I was wondering if there was anyway to send values like %20 into JSON without it encoding it as a space
[09:25:37] <Harry> I just want to send %20 as plain text
[09:28:33] <Ilhami> :P
[10:11:50] <Azrael_-> hi
[10:12:14] <Azrael_-> how can i replace the content of a table cell with jquery?
[10:12:49] <tectonic> Azrael_- $('td.class').html('new content')
[10:13:14] <Azrael_-> thanks
[10:25:00] <ThoMe> hiho
[10:25:11] <ThoMe> when i use if (event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault();
[10:25:15] <ThoMe> no problem
[10:25:29] <ThoMe> when i use preventDefault and then example alert() then submit my form.
[10:25:32] <ThoMe> how i can disable this?
[10:31:10] <Azrael_-> i add 2 links to a table cell. how can i put a space in between them with jquery? (currently: .append($('<td>').append($('<a>')...).append($('<a>')...)); )
[10:31:43] <Azrael_-> just adding a .text in between them doesn't work
[10:36:35] <tectonic> Azrael_- With CSS
[10:36:48] <tectonic> Or with a &nbsp;
[10:56:13] <Azrael_-> tectonic: yes, but if i try this: .append($('<td>').append($('<a>')...).append($('&nbsp;')).append($('<a>')...)); i get a syntax error
[10:56:35] <tectonic> you can build larger structures at once
[10:57:02] <tectonic> .append($("<td><a href='foo'>hello</a> <a href='bar'>world</a></td>")
[11:05:40] <sshine> hi. I'm trying to determine if a given <option/> is selected. I'm currently looping with $("#some_select option").each(function() { var option = $(this); ... }); but I just can't figure it out.
[11:06:10] <arthurvr> You can use is(‚Äò:checked‚Äô)
[11:06:11] <sshine> I know that I can use a CSS selector, but doing so (actually, avoiding the ones that are selected, using ":not(:checked)" gives me insane running speeds for a dropdown of ~1000 elements)
[11:06:15] <sshine> ahh. thanks.
[11:06:37] <sshine> I'll try and see if that works (the selector was previously placed in the .each query)
[11:07:26] <sshine> this is crazy!
[11:08:41] <Azrael_-> tectonic: hmmm, ok, thanks
[11:13:39] <cjohnson> sshine: using the selector in the each isn't the right way
[11:13:55] <cjohnson> $theSelect.find('option:checked') would be how you do it
[11:17:22] <sshine> cjohnson, thanks. otherwise I'm searching the entire document, right? that's sort of silly.
[11:17:47] <cjohnson> I'm not sure exactly, but if you're using .each to find the selected element that's definitely wrong
[11:18:00] <cjohnson> you aren't necessarily searching the entire document but you're running a lot of code per-option that doesn't need to be run
[11:18:20] <cjohnson> takes 3ms to find the right option in my quick test using my method
[11:43:36] <mty> can someone help-me?
[11:44:29] <aceofspades19> mty: with what
[12:16:04] <Robdgreat> aceofspades19: you mean with-what
[13:46:23] <dropdrive> Are there recommended plugins for capturing and reacting to the part of the URL after the #?  Ben Allman has some plugins, but they are all from around 2009.
[13:51:21] <Ilhami> I don't know what you mean.
[14:02:13] <BlueProtoman> How can I convert a character to a key code, or vice versa?  (Not just letters, so adding the ASCII value of 'a' won't cut it)
[14:07:35] <Ilhami> Hahahahahahaha

[14:08:04] <Ilhami> what a trick play
[14:26:14] <_pudding> hey all -- i'm trying to figure out how to pass a javascript object to a sinatra route handler, but something seems to be breaking without giving me an error...
[14:26:20] <_pudding> this seems to work fine: https://gist.github.com/hieronymusbosch/4d718cb88a034c70648c
[14:27:09] <_pudding> how do I include a js object previously created and still send the $(this).serialize() parameter?
[14:27:42] <_pudding> (if there's anything obvious i'm overlooking, let me know if i should go read something on the topic)
[14:30:58] <aceofspades19> _pudding: maybe I misunderstanding you, but you could construct a formdata object
[14:31:13] <shoky> _pudding you can use .serializeArray() and add stuff to that array
[14:31:54] <_pudding> hm, so i already constructed a form in a .erb file which has been working nicely so far
[14:32:20] <_pudding> i thought i could somehow just post my form and somehow package my javascript in with it
[14:32:38] <_pudding> or actually, is it possible to add my javascript to a form input before posting?
[14:33:11] <_pudding> maybe then it would just get shipped off to the route handler and included with i call "$(this).serialize()" in the post request
[14:33:32] <aceofspades19> _pudding: in the submit handler you can do anything you want really
[14:36:25] <BlueProtoman> When I press the comma key "," and print the resulting JQuery event, the event.which is 188 ("º") when it should be 44 (",").  I'm on Ubuntu 14.10, using the latest version of Chromium.  What gives?
[14:40:52] <_pudding> aceofspades19, i think this is making more sense now
[14:41:17] <_pudding> i'm adding the javascript object as a data-attribute to the form
[14:41:26] <_pudding> and then posting
[14:41:39] <aceofspades19> _pudding: there is an easier way
[14:42:28] <aceofspades19> instead of $(this).serialize(), do { form:$(this).serialize(), jsobject: object }
[14:42:32] <aceofspades19> at least I think thats easier
[14:43:02] <_pudding> hm, trying it out now
[14:44:59] <_pudding> aceofspades19, for some reason my erb template fails to show when i switch to that
[14:45:01] <_pudding> any idea why?
[14:45:23] <_pudding> i'm also not totally sure i know how to access the jsobject on the backend either after i do that
[14:45:23] <aceofspades19> _pudding: probably because you have to access the form differently if you do it that way
[14:45:51] <aceofspades19> _pudding: I don't know ruby so I can't help you with the server side code
[14:46:10] <_pudding> cool cool, i'm gonna toy around a bit more
[14:46:17] <_pudding> i really appreciate the help!
[14:47:07] <aceofspades19> _pudding: no problem
[15:35:40] <Primero> I can't found a working sample of change label width with jquery. I got several examples with google, but nothing works, just said that, but dont...
[15:36:21] <Primero> somebody know how change the width of label in textbox
[15:36:37] <tables> http://paste2.org/V2Gkgnf1  <-- how do i make this work on load (which it is right now) and also work when i click a <a> link?
[15:43:08] <BillCriswell> tables: Put it in a function and call the function on load and click.
[15:45:02] <BillCriswell> tables: function getInbox() { /* Everything you have in loads callback */ } $(window).load(getInbox); $('a').on('click', getInbox);
[15:45:33] <BillCriswell> Primero: labels are display inline so you can set a width on them.
[15:45:48] <BillCriswell> You have to change the display to block or inline-block to allow that.
[15:46:52] <Primero> yes, O read int samples that, but dont works http://jsfiddle.net/challenger/upcZJ/ the sample dont works
[15:47:19] <BillCriswell> What?
[15:48:11] <Primero> I read it in samples, i found it this sample, i add css, but dont works
[15:49:04] <Primero> http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/justify-elements-using-jquery-and-css/ said that, but dont works whan i copy, the label change top the textbox
[15:49:47] <Primero> im join both samples and still dont work
[15:50:09] <Primero> you can said me one link to one working sample, please
[15:53:49] <BillCriswell> Primero: You didn't add the right css.
[15:54:29] <Primero> http://paste2.org/Mcg38Kv4
[15:56:33] <BillCriswell> You're still missing some.
[15:57:28] <Primero> what im missing? is display: block;
[15:57:53] <BillCriswell> float: left;
[15:58:05] <Primero> let me add
[16:01:12] <Primero> nice, i found three errors more, and works, thanks !
[16:01:37] <Primero> thanks a lot billcriswell
[16:01:49] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[16:34:33] <Primero> BillCriswell, when I put 2 fields, side to side, both label are in left and both textbox in the rigth, i want label left each textbox
[16:35:08] <BillCriswell> Primero: These are #css questions. You should ask in there.
[16:35:17] <Primero> thanks
[16:36:09] <Duvdevan> BillCriswell, he might move them with jquery though :P
[16:38:10] <BillCriswell> True, true.
[16:43:46] <Primero> BillCriswell, come to #css and help me please, :D
[16:44:08] <BillCriswell> Primero: I'm working on my own puzzle currently haha
[16:44:20] <Primero> ok,  :D
[16:44:31] <Primero> can I help you?
[16:46:44] <BillCriswell> I like to figure things out on my own, but thank you!
[17:14:55] <Primero> Im creating a modal, and adding elements with js. works fine, but how can I resize modal to fit the size of content?
[17:18:05] <Duvdevan> Primero using bootstrap?
[17:21:26] <Ilhami> it's unsafe to do session management with js right?
[17:21:43] <Ilhami> I mean you will have to use php for that right?
[17:21:52] <Ilhami> or some other server side language?
[17:22:50] <systemfault> Session management is a server-side thing.
[17:23:09] <Ilhami> yeah.
[17:36:46] <BillCriswell> Hm, actually tried something and it worked out lol
[17:37:31] <oste> anyone know of a good front end contenteditable javascript?
[17:39:07] <BillCriswell> systemfault: http://jsbin.com/jocodexiya/1/edit?js,output can you think of a way to write this more intelligently? Feel like I'm missing something obvious.
[17:39:25] <systemfault> Looking
[17:43:50] <systemfault> BillCriswell: No, sorry, I can't find a nicer way to do it.
[17:45:04] <BillCriswell> Ok I geuss that's good then.
[17:50:54] <BillCriswell> Thanks for taking a look.
[18:28:54] <Jayden> How can I make a banner(bunch of text) in one page, and it have it display across all pages? My website is 100+ pages and I want a quick way to add a banner notifcation to each page
[18:32:49] <shoky> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/tunujateso/2/edit?js,output   thanks for the challenge ;D
[18:34:12] <shoky> (it's not nicer code but works much better. actually checking which edge you intersected from before entering to after)
[18:36:05] <BillCriswell> shoky: Welcome! Not sure I'm following the second thing you said though.
[18:37:01] <shoky> BillCriswell: your code is very easy to fool into getting the wrong direction, if you move your mouse quickly
[18:37:22] <BillCriswell> Ah, there we go.
[18:37:47] <shoky> especially if you move it quickly over a corner
[18:38:00] <shoky> or just enter near a corner
[18:39:03] <BillCriswell> I got ya, nice.
[18:40:49] <shoky> thought that's what you were asking for, as otherwise your code is already neat and intelligent ;p
[18:41:02] <shoky> anyways, gnight
[18:41:19] <BillCriswell> shoky: Have a good night!
