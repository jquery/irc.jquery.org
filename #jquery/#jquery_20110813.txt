[00:02:47] <_wired> anyone? just less than 6 hours of your time. 100 bucks.
[00:04:19] <chjj> whats that now?
[00:05:06] <_wired> haha, i have a really quick small prototype needing building. looking for someone who's good at jq and a little bit of PHP
[00:05:22] <_wired> i have the source codes for most of the functions already. just need putting stuff together
[00:06:32] <_wired> 1) http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77055/1.png <-- u start off with a few elements and a "background canvas", 2) http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77055/2.png <-- you drag and drop em to the canvas area, 3) http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77055/3.png <-- you're able to resize, rotate, etc, 4) what you've done becomes a real image (via PHP/GD)
[00:12:54] <coldhead> anyone for cyber?
[00:17:51] <thomedy> does ajax count if i am using jquery to run it for help in this room
[00:17:58] <thomedy> the ajax room blows
[00:19:14] <coldhead> try us
[00:19:22] <coldhead> there's not much else going on anyway
[00:19:24] <thomedy> crossing y fingers
[00:19:34] <thomedy> okay im running a simple ajax call
[00:19:44] <thomedy> $.post('file.php');
[00:19:49] <thomedy> but its not doing anything
[00:20:01] <coldhead> you're not telling it to do anything
[00:20:10] <thomedy> i thought that was what the file.php did
[00:20:20] <coldhead> you're just saying :make a POST request to this file with no data and do nothing with the output:
[00:20:23] <thomedy> i thought that was why it was necessary according to the docs
[00:20:36] <coldhead> what do you want it to do?
[00:20:47] <thomedy> basically im eventually building a autocomplete
[00:20:59] <thomedy> but im doing it one step at a time
[00:21:18] <thomedy> i was able to access my database
[00:21:35] <thomedy> which by the way was super exciting because it is im new to database
[00:21:42] <coldhead> a post call usually goes $.post('somefile.php', {foo: 7, bar: 'pants'}, function (data) {alert("HI MOM I GOT " + data);});
[00:22:04] <thomedy> okay so i need all that....
[00:22:17] <coldhead> well it's not much
[00:22:23] <coldhead> and you don't NEED it all
[00:22:29] <thomedy> i ran a successful ajax before but i was sending a file to the php file
[00:22:33] <coldhead> but that illustrates sending and receiving data
[00:22:34] <thomedy> for saving and opening
[00:22:34] <mathi> this doesn't alert "TEST", what's wrong ?
[00:22:40] <mathi> $(html).find("#paramId").attr('name', 'TEST'); alert($(html).find("#paramId").attr('name'));
[00:22:40] <thomedy> that must be the thin you meant
[00:23:12] <mathi> (it prints "id" which is the original value)
[00:23:21] <thomedy> okay your amazing let e think of how i can use your awesome help to make ajax happen
[00:23:36] <coldhead> mathi: what is 'html'?
[00:23:40] <thomedy> ill start with jquery.com
[00:23:51] <coldhead> ?post @ thomedy
[00:23:56] <coldhead> oh the bot is dead
[00:24:08] <mathi> coldhead, it's a string :  var html = '<applet...><param...
[00:24:13] <coldhead> thomedy: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[00:24:19] <coldhead> check the examples
[00:24:22] <thomedy> yeah thats where i was headed thank you again
[00:24:28] <mathi> coldhead, jquery can find the elements, but can't change it
[00:24:33] <coldhead> mathi: let me try that in a page for you
[00:24:55] <coldhead> mathi: it might not work if html isn't attached anywhere
[00:25:13] <coldhead> you might need $html = $(html); then do your operations on $html
[00:25:16] <coldhead> instead of $(html)
[00:25:28] <mathi> coldhead, what will be the difference ?
[00:25:50] <coldhead> because otherweise it's like this $('<foo id="lol">').attr('id', 'pants');
[00:25:56] <coldhead> and then
[00:26:08] <coldhead> $('<foo id="lol">').attr('id');
[00:26:17] <coldhead> you're creating a new thing each time
[00:26:34] <coldhead> so your change is being made and then discarded
[00:26:45] <coldhead> because $(html) the second time creates a fresh thingy
[00:26:48] <coldhead> with the old ID
[00:26:52] <xover> Hmm. Wasn't there a naming guideline for jQuery UI plugins somewhere? Should the arg to the widget factory be "ui.widgetname" or just "widgetname"?
[00:27:42] <coldhead> xover: there's http://jqueryui.com/docs/Developer_Guide but i haven't read it
[00:27:42] <mathi> coldhead, i will try give me a sec)
[00:27:46] <Taggnostr2> how can I check if an element exists? i.e. I have a selector that gives me the element I want, but it might not be there
[00:28:11] <xover> coldhead: Thanks. That's what I thought, but it doesn't seem to touch on naming.
[00:29:48] <coldhead> mathi: http://jsfiddle.net/2hJ9Y/
[00:30:11] <coldhead> xover: i think the UI nerds are mostly sleeping if you want ask later...
[00:30:48] <coldhead> Taggnostr2:  if ( $('.someselector').length > 0 ) {etc..}
[00:30:57] <Taggnostr2> thanks coldhead
[00:31:19] <xover> There was something about filenames and possibly that an "ui." prefix was for jQuery UI core widgets, so third party plugins should not use a ui. prefix. I think I'll go with that assumption for now.
[00:31:51] <coldhead> xover: that's fine by me :)
[00:32:45] <xover> (trying to update Christian Yates' ColumnView plugin to use the widget factory and ThemeRoller themes)
[00:33:17] <djQuery1> xover: it should not be ui.widgetname it should be your names space.widgetname
[00:33:34] <djQuery1> like djQuery.coolwidget
[00:33:44] <coldhead> djQuery++
[00:34:00] <xover> Ok, so it should have a prefix to give a faux namespace?
[00:34:15] <xover> Just not ui. because that's reserved for etc.?
[00:34:20] <djQuery> well after you do it it wont be faux anymore
[00:34:57] <djQuery> xover: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide22
[00:35:15] * xover was making the distinction between a naming convention and a language-native namespeace qua namespace, but… :-)
[00:35:25] <coldhead> the next best thing to having aj around is having someone who knows where to find his stuff
[00:35:37] <coldhead> lol qua
[00:35:37] <xover> heh heh
[00:35:49] <coldhead> if i had a dollar for everytime someone said that in here i'd have $1
[00:35:57] <iman> how can I get event source of clicking of whole of page ?
[00:36:16] <coldhead> event.target, iman ?
[00:36:26] <coldhead> if that's um... body?
[00:36:30] <xover> djQuery: In any case, thank you very much; my Google-fu was utterly failing me on this question.
[00:36:47] <iman> coldhead: I have a problem in javascript - but I can't login in #javascript
[00:36:51] <mathi> coldhead, working great :) now the only problem left is to display $html, I tried using $html.html(), but it displays only the content, and not the top element
[00:37:15] <iman> coldhead: I want to get source of click in anywhere of web-page
[00:37:20] <coldhead> mathi: you have to wrap it in something and do .html() on that
[00:37:33] <mathi> oh right :)
[00:37:40] <iman> coldhead: it means this click happen on which element
[00:37:59] <coldhead> iman: $(document).bind('click', function (e) {alert('something somewhere was clicked');});
[00:38:19] <coldhead> then e.target will tell you what was actually clicked
[00:39:37] <iman> coldhead: I don't have jquery library
[00:39:56] <coldhead> ah
[00:40:15] <coldhead> you should get it
[00:40:19] <coldhead> it's free
[00:40:59] <iman> coldhead: i know, i use jquery in other project, but this prject doesn't have jquery
[00:41:19] <coldhead> you should ask in #javascript then
[00:41:26] <coldhead> or read jQuery's source
[00:41:36] <coldhead> this channel is for jQuery
[00:41:45] <coldhead> we really like jQuery here
[00:41:58] <iman> coldhead: I have a problem in javascript - but I can't login in #javascript
[00:42:16] <coldhead> iman: ask in #freenode about how to register
[00:42:21] <coldhead> they will help you
[00:43:53] <coldhead> mathi: great success?
[00:44:20] <mathi> coldhead, yes everything's fine now thx for your help! :)
[00:44:43] <coldhead> a pleasure! happy hacking
[00:46:02] <mathi> i've always wrapped objects with $(), and didn't encounter that issue yet
[00:46:19] <mathi> i'm a little bit confused:)
[00:46:28] <coldhead> objects are fine, strings are different
[00:46:44] <coldhead> $(somelement) uses a reference to that element
[00:46:55] <coldhead> but $('sometext') creates a new element
[00:47:07] <coldhead> and it's just hanging around, unattached
[00:47:15] <coldhead> so you need to reuse it or attach it to the dom
[00:47:47] <thomedy> okay i just read the docs really slowly
[00:47:51] <thomedy> i have a question
[00:47:59] <thomedy> on a (i think) call back
[00:48:36] <mathi> si if I do, in the cas above,  $html = $(html), it's attaching it to the DOM ? does that mean that an applet will be launched as soon as $html = $(html) ?
[00:48:38] <thomedy> function there is the parameter data... does the jquery remember whats going on and fill data from the backend php file
[00:48:57] <coldhead> no mathi! that will be unattached
[00:49:13] <coldhead> you need to do like $(html).appendTo('#something')
[00:49:23] <coldhead> or something similar
[00:49:59] <coldhead> thomedy: what jQuery gets back from the server will be available by whatever name you give to the callback's argument
[00:50:14] <mathi> so $html will not be in DOM as long as I don't integrate it soewhere on the page
[00:50:24] <coldhead> so $.post('lol.php', function (boobies) {alert(boobies)})
[00:50:31] <coldhead> will show what it got
[00:50:40] <coldhead> that's right, mathi
[00:50:46] <thomedy> good choice by the way
[00:50:52] <thomedy> so boobies comes from lol.php
[00:50:56] <coldhead> but only when you are creating a new element by passing a string to $()
[00:51:17] <coldhead> if you do $('#someselector') that will find something that's already in the DOM for you
[00:51:27] <coldhead> it's already attached
[00:51:29] <thomedy> i should just try a bit of it and see whats going on...im in college for computer science
[00:51:29] <coldhead> thomedy: yes
[00:51:40] <thomedy> but they don't teach us web stuff
[00:51:48] <thomedy> its all strong languages and calculus
[00:51:50] <coldhead> thomedy: do you have firebug or the google chrome web inspector?
[00:51:50] <thomedy> and what not
[00:51:53] <thomedy> yeah i do
[00:52:02] <thomedy> i was reading how to use that
[00:52:03] <coldhead> you can see exactly what's coming and going in the network tab there
[00:52:03] <thomedy> too
[00:52:10] <coldhead> highly educational
[00:52:17] <thomedy> i would have to find the page.. that showd me how to use it
[00:52:25] <coldhead> college's are about a decade behind what people are actually using in practice
[00:52:27] <thomedy> but i rmember it a bit
[00:52:34] <thomedy> depends on which region
[00:52:34] <coldhead> colleges*
[00:52:46] <thomedy> i spent the first half of my college learning c++
[00:52:48] <coldhead> well yes, it might be more
[00:52:54] <thomedy> im moving to illinois and there ill be learning java
[00:52:57] <thomedy> so thats good
[00:53:16] <thomedy> im actually excited about java cuz i only did one semester of it
[00:53:28] <thomedy> and filling out what im missing will be usefull
[00:53:32] <coldhead> java is much nicer than c++
[00:53:35] <thomedy> i want to use it more for the web
[00:53:45] <coldhead> but you should learn a lot of languages :)
[00:53:48] <thomedy> i actually really like c_++ cuz of the power
[00:54:11] <coldhead> power yes but at what cose to your soul...
[00:54:18] <coldhead> no they both have their place
[00:54:21] <thomedy> i enjoyed it
[00:54:28] <thomedy> im not worried about it though
[00:54:37] <thomedy> whatever pays for my sons college
[00:54:52] <bbrandon> coldhear: you're a jquery pro
[00:54:54] <thomedy> i would like to build webstuff way more though
[00:55:23] <bbrandon> coldhead: would you mind telling me what $("<div/>") is about?
[00:55:43] <coldhead> bbrandon: that creates a new div element for you and wraps it in jQuery goodness
[00:55:58] <bbrandon> can you link to me it in the docs?
[00:56:03] <bbrandon> can't find it for the life of me
[00:56:23] <bbrandon> pleeeeeaaasee =)
[00:56:36] <coldhead> it's better explained in textbooks and tutorials
[00:56:40] <coldhead> but i'll find the official link
[00:56:43] <bbrandon> thnx
[00:57:35] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[00:57:54] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[00:58:10] <bbrandon> amazing. thank you
[00:58:17] <eragon77> Hi
[00:58:26] <eragon77> i have problem please
[00:58:41] <eragon77> how activate this script : http://pastebin.com/FVMBBKda
[00:59:01] <eragon77> <div id="conteneur"></div> and <script>?</script>
[00:59:49] <SoulRaven>  is it posibile to change the default text for the webkit-validation-bubble
[00:59:54] <SoulRaven> i mean with js or something else?
[00:59:54] <SoulRaven> ?
[01:00:37] <coldhead> eragon77: yes, that should work
[01:00:45] <coldhead> you also need to include jQuery in the page
[01:04:31] <eragon77> coldhead
[01:04:37] <eragon77> yes i know
[01:05:04] <eragon77> need <script>??????</script>
[01:06:27] <eragon77> <script>var _succes_nb = "10", _succes_str = "Hello"</script> ?
[01:06:38] <eragon77> coldhead ?
[01:06:38] <Lampoon> coldhead  is great
[01:09:01] <eragon77> Lampoon, you can help me ?
[01:09:39] <coldhead> put it inside <script> tags
[01:09:39] <coldhead> yes
[01:09:44] <coldhead> like you already said
[01:10:02] <coldhead> and jQuery stuff should go inside ready()
[01:10:41] <coldhead> <script>$(document).ready(function () { DUMP YOUR STUFF HERE });</script>
[01:12:22] <coldhead> eragon77: here is a tidier version of your code http://jsfiddle.net/KMwpm/
[01:24:26] <thomedy> i read that the jquery version of ajax doesn't work on ie 6and lower
[01:24:29] <thomedy> is that correct
[01:25:33] <thomedy> i think i just got it the php file on the backend has to return something
[01:25:43] <thomedy> and it looks to be formated in the backend
[01:25:59] <coldhead> that is not correct, thomedy
[01:26:02] <dr0id> well
[01:26:03] <coldhead> it works in ie6
[01:26:09] <dr0id> you really wanna support ie6 ?
[01:26:10] <coldhead> and older IEs are irrelevant
[01:26:13] <dr0id> and yeah, it works in ie6
[01:26:35] <dr0id> yo coldhead
[01:26:48] <coldhead> but yes, the backend has to format and echo something so jQuery can access it
[01:26:54] <coldhead> heya dr0id
[01:27:10] <dr0id> howz the day bro ?
[01:28:05] <coldhead> pretty satisfying
[01:28:10] <coldhead> howz yourz?
[01:28:23] <dr0id> just fine, doing some hard work today :P
[01:29:46] <thomedy> i thought it was the goal to make it as visible to everyone
[01:30:22] <eragon77> coldhead
[01:30:24] <eragon77> yes and ?
[01:30:45] <eragon77> i want active this script
[01:32:06] <eragon77> g = e("<p/>").append(_succes_nb + "G - " + _succes_str),
[01:32:19] <eragon77> i need <script> for this ?
[01:32:47] <coldhead> if you want something written in javascript to run in your browser it needs to be in <script> tags
[01:32:57] <dr0id> LOL
[01:33:04] <coldhead> otherwise the browser will think you want to show it on the page
[01:33:35] <coldhead> you might have to read some basics on how all this web stuff works, eragon77, or this is going to be a very long day for both of us
[01:34:11] <eragon77> or you can help me
[01:35:16] <coldhead> i am helping
[01:35:22] <coldhead> helping you to help yourself
[01:35:36] <coldhead> i'm kind of like jesus in that and other important respects
[01:35:40] <coldhead> (stigmata)
[01:35:55] <coldhead> but this is a support channel, not #handholding
[01:36:02] <eragon77> i have to go, thx for help (joke)
[01:36:02] <coldhead> amirite snover
[01:36:06] <eragon77> bye
[01:36:15] <coldhead> you horrible little shit
[01:39:11] <dr0id> Heh
[01:39:38] <SoulRaven>  is it posibile to change the default text for the webkit-validation-bubble
[01:39:41] <SoulRaven> i mean with js or something else?
[01:40:13] * xover is suddenly very glad he doesn't understand French…
[01:42:21] <coldhead> he said "I
[01:42:21] <coldhead>      would like to take a slam on the disease that irritates the anus winter, a
[01:42:21] <coldhead>      sick of the cold-called gastroenteritis, next time, I
[01:42:24] <coldhead>      put my bonnetttttt!
[01:42:38] <coldhead> "
[01:42:46] <coldhead> which is pretty awesome, really
[01:49:10] <xover> SoulRaven: Seems the answer is no, except Firefox has a vendor-specific attribute to allow it. Just Googling the pseudo-class name gives a lot of good hits that bear on this.
[01:53:06] <xover> Grr. Dear Git(hub), Why do your diffs not ignore whitespace by default? Sincerely, me.
[01:53:44] <dr0id> Haha
[01:56:32] <thomedy> what does it mean if when i look at the net tab of firebug and see there is no requests
[01:57:02] <thomedy> im trying to do jquery ajax
[02:25:42] <coldhead> thomedy: try right clicking on the console and Enable XHR Logging or similar
[02:53:43] <lastinosva> bonjour

[04:29:32] <na3r> how can i get offset of an element in chrome?
[04:30:02] <magcius> intellilogic, if (this.name == foo)
[04:30:16] <magcius> na3r, same way as any other browser: $("#thing").offset()
[04:30:51] <na3r> magcius, but it doesn't work
[04:31:01] <magcius> na3r, what do you mean?

[04:32:58] <ciss> na3r: disable the console.log line and try again
[04:33:07] <noobie25> is it best practice to keep my element "hidden" on document load and make it visible on click?
[04:33:15] <ciss> er, console.dir
[04:33:43] <na3r> ciss, i don't think the problem was that
[04:33:54] <magcius> na3r, no harm in not trying!

[04:48:28] <motaka2> I mean it doest work in IE
[05:01:24] <intellilogic> I can't figure out how to make this run in jsfiddle, lol, but that's not my issue, my issue is trying to incriment the proper field - http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/fu9AX/4/
[05:06:41] <motaka2> no one there?
[05:06:59] <intellilogic> apaerntly not :(
[05:08:00] <motaka2> intellilogic: Can you help me
[05:08:02] <motaka2> ?
[05:08:11] <motaka2> I think my question is simple
[05:08:19] <intellilogic> Im noobie, probably more than you
[05:08:37] <intellilogic> blind leading the blind ;)~
[05:08:57] <motaka2> intellilogic: the change event does not fire in IE for select option tags
[05:09:12] <motaka2> do you have any idea
[05:10:09] <Woet> motaka2: and what did you do to debug your issue?
[05:10:51] <motaka2> Woet:  I searched in stack flow notrhing remarkable i found
[05:11:00] <Woet> motaka2: alerts? console.log?
[05:11:28] <motaka2> Woet: it works very fine in Firefox but it doesnt work in IE
[05:11:51] <Woet> motaka2: yes, and how have you determined with absolute certainty it's the .change callback
[05:11:57] <Woet> maybe it's your function you call within it?
[05:12:05] <motaka2> http://pastebin.com/QVBQZ11g
[05:12:16] <Woet> yes, i saw that
[05:12:19] <Woet> [14:11:51] <Woet> motaka2: yes, and how have you determined with absolute certainty it's the .change callback
[05:12:28] <Woet> [14:11:56] <Woet> maybe it's your function you call within it?
[05:12:33] <motaka2> I put an alert inside it doesnt fireup in IE
[05:14:13] <motaka2> Woet:   http://pastebin.com/A0m598Fi
[05:14:50] <Woet> motaka2: http://jsfiddle.net/V3LJ9/ - works fine for me on IE
[05:16:51] <motaka2> so whats the problem with mine?
[05:17:08] <motaka2> Woet: So whats the problem with mine ?
[05:17:16] <Woet> motaka2: you not debugging it properly.
[05:17:28] * Woet hugs bot-t
[05:17:28] * bot-t hugs Woet back
[05:17:35] <Woet> motaka2: put the script + relevant html/css on www.jsfiddle.net
[05:17:54] <intellilogic> I can't figure out how to make this run in jsfiddle, lol, but that's not my issue, my issue is trying to incriment the proper field - http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/fu9AX/4/
[05:18:00] <intellilogic> <3 Woet
[05:18:08] <Woet> i was already looking
[05:18:43] <intellilogic> :)
[05:18:49] <intellilogic> IDK why it doesn
[05:18:56] <intellilogic> 't work on JSfiddle (first time with JS fiddle)
[05:19:06] <intellilogic> but it works adding the row in FF (live)
[05:22:24] <Woet> intellilogic: change ondomready to no wrap (body)
[05:22:28] <Woet> on jsfiddle left top
[05:22:29] <Woet> then it works
[05:22:35] <Woet> i don't understand your actual issue
[05:28:36] <motaka2> Woet:   http://jsfiddle.net/donkarlo/jbh9p/
[05:28:54] <Woet> i said relevant css and html, motaka2...
[05:29:10] <Woet> and just pasting PHP code into your javascript is not helping eith
[05:29:11] <Woet> er
[05:29:29] <motaka2> Woet: what php ?
[05:29:47] <Woet> motaka2: the eight <?php tags ?
[05:29:52] <Woet>             $("#years").html('<img src="<?php echo Reg::get("url")."web/images/system/interface/ajax-loader.gif"; ?>"/>');
[05:29:54] <Woet> for example.
[05:30:13] <huglester> guys, how would I do: smth silimar? $('div.errors', $(this)).html('test'); I want to access div.errors which is insite $(this) object
[05:30:16] <motaka2> Woet: ok I will update it now
[05:30:19] <Woet> brb
[05:33:21] <motaka2> Woet:  Here you are: updated:   http://jsfiddle.net/donkarlo/jbh9p/1/
[05:33:27] <sylow> Hi, I'm looking for an example where if you click a link, some value is submitted with jquery to an ajax call (that saves some data in a database). Anyone knows a good example for that?
[05:33:52] <sylow> a bit like when you would submit a form with jquery
[05:35:08] <sylow> would I do that with a css selector or an onClick event ?
[05:36:58] <sylow> actually , it's for some taglist I have.. I want to click a word and then it should be saved in a blacklist without refreshing the whole page
[05:38:52] <JKarsrud> sylow: I'd do a $('taglistlink').click(function(e) { $.ajax(); e.preventDefault() });
[05:38:53] <JKarsrud> :)
[05:40:37] <sylow> JKarsrud: alright. Then it's still a puzzle to me to retrieve the data between the <a>data</a> tags. But it's not like onclick="do_stuff(myword, 123);" which looked like another option to me ?
[05:42:41] <JKarsrud> nah, inline JS is a bad thing
[05:43:35] <JKarsrud> But what if you do something like <a data-tagid="123" data-tag="myword" href="#">myword</a>
[05:44:02] <JKarsrud> and then inside the click handler, you do $(this).data('tagid') and $(this).data('tag') ?
[05:44:32] <sylow> right.. thanks. I've seen such code , what should i be googling for to learn more about that?
[05:44:49] <sylow> jquery is so *huge that it's not always easy to know where to start
[05:45:06] <sylow> should read a book about it or so, sorry for my noob questions;)
[05:45:08] <JKarsrud> idk, just continue to ask in here? Great source of knowledge :)
[05:45:16] <sylow> that's true, thanks :)
[05:45:30] <JKarsrud> sec and I'll hook up an example for you :)
[05:45:44] <sylow> that would be great!
[05:49:00] <JKarsrud> http://jsfiddle.net/dF6Ux/
[05:49:21] <JKarsrud> not the whole ajax part, but I bet you understand how that is done if you see ?ajax
[05:49:21] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:49:58] <sylow> JKarsrud: awesome, exactly what I was looking for, thank you very much :)
[05:50:56] <JKarsrud> No problemo, not like I have anything better to do anyway :D
[05:52:59] <JKarsrud> sylow: If you have any more issues, just hollar, I'll be online for a couple more hours today, so :)
[05:53:47] <sylow> thanks :)
[05:55:09] <sylow> JKarsrud if you have some time left, don't you have a blog or something with tuts ?
[05:56:41] <JKarsrud> hmm, not really. I usually google or read the docs :P
[05:56:51] <JKarsrud> Or ask in here
[05:57:42] <sylow> JKarsrud: yeah, but i mean don't you write your own articles?
[05:59:45] <JKarsrud> Hah, right
[05:59:46] <JKarsrud> nope
[06:00:03] <JKarsrud> don't have the time to get a site up and running, takes too much time :P
[06:02:28] <sylow> JKarsrud: yeah, but you can you wordpress and some template
[06:02:45] <intellilogic> I have comments in the JS / jQuery where I need help - http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/fu9AX
[06:03:02] <sylow> been building my own frameworks too, but there goes much time in that indeed
[06:03:30] <intellilogic> errr:  http://jsfiddle.net/fu9AX/9/
[06:04:41] <JKarsrud> sylow: yeah, I know, but it's having the time to write that's the problemt
[06:04:43] <JKarsrud> -t
[06:05:18] <Lochlan> JKarsrud, you sound like me
[06:05:26] <sylow> given the time you came up with my example you seem very fast
[06:05:37] <Lochlan> i make so many people's websites.. dont even have my own real one
[06:06:11] <sylow> Lochlan: you're a freelancer ?
[06:06:27] <Lochlan> intellilogic, save the val line as a variable
[06:06:33] <Lochlan> yea sylow
[06:06:45] <Lochlan> plus ive worked for companies
[06:07:11] <sylow> I hope to become one.. but I guess is that you'll need a way to promote yourself a bit
[06:07:29] <Lochlan> you'll be amazed how well word of mouth works
[06:07:33] <Lochlan> everyone needs a website
[06:07:58] <Lochlan> i've been fortunate to have a designer friend
[06:08:09] <Lochlan> who just knows so many people
[06:08:13] <Lochlan> he gets all the work we do
[06:08:26] <Lochlan> im usually working fulltime and do that on the side
[06:08:31] <sylow> ah.. nice, you know I'm pretty good with backends, but frontend is what people see.. it's hard to be a pro on all levels, at least for me
[06:08:40] <Lochlan> ah
[06:08:44] <Lochlan> i'm all front end
[06:08:55] <sylow> my designs are so amateurish, can't sell that ;)
[06:08:57] <Lochlan> im not even that interested in back end.. but feel like i need to get into it more
[06:09:01] <Lochlan> ha my designs are terrible
[06:09:07] <Lochlan> i just do what works
[06:09:30] <Lochlan> if i could design
[06:09:37] <Lochlan> i'd just do everything then
[06:10:08] <JKarsrud> sylow: well, you need to explain stuff too, and working full time leaves you kind of gutted at the end of a 10 hour day
[06:10:26] <Lochlan> JKarsrud, exactly!
[06:10:38] <JKarsrud> but I plan to get a site up anyway tho, just for the lulz
[06:10:46] <Lochlan> i wish i had started a blog 3 years ago, and recorded everything good i did
[06:11:02] <sylow> yeah, after a whole day of work.. just want to watch some zero intellect youtube or so
[06:11:21] <Lochlan> i started it yesterday, configured wordpress with some standard template, paste in one post of jquery
[06:11:29] <sylow> cool
[06:11:36] <Lochlan> tried to do a second and i realised i couldnt be bothered explaining it
[06:11:40] <intellilogic> Lochlan:  http://jsfiddle.net/fu9AX/10/  But it still doesn't identify the "db_value" appropriate input to apply the effect
[06:12:16] <sylow> Lochlan: sometimes people only need the code, I think if you paste some stuff each day that after a year you get lot's of traffic ;)
[06:13:14] <Lochlan> sylow: yeah, I'll do that. I started saving a notepad doc of code, some of it needs css and html to go with it.. effort
[06:13:31] <Lochlan> i spose i can always update if someone made a comment asking about it
[06:13:42] <sylow> sure
[06:14:03] <Lochlan> fuck yea Im gonna do it
[06:14:10] <sylow> :D
[06:14:10] <JKarsrud> thinking of just setting up some posterous stuff or something
[06:16:48] <Foxandxss> hello, I have a question: If I have a <ul> and every <li> have the same class. I want to bind the hover event on the li. Is there a way to detect what li are you hovering? with $('.myLi') the event will be triggered on every li item
[06:18:37] <JKarsrud> $(this) inside the hover handler :)
[06:19:03] <JKarsrud> "this" is the current elemet
[06:19:05] <JKarsrud> element*
[06:20:07] <Foxandxss> currently Im changing the display of a child div to block (was invisible)
[06:20:10] <Foxandxss> I will try that

[06:26:21] <dr0id> paul_irish: He's back :D
[06:26:27] <Foxandxss> uh, thanks god
[06:26:35] <Foxandxss> or paul_irish
[06:26:35] <Will-k> lynx___: Could you please stop? No good will come of spamming, and you're wasting your time more than ours.
[06:26:35] <Foxandxss> :P
[06:26:42] <mrmist> I +qd it for now
[06:27:00] <dr0id> thanks mrmist :)
[06:27:22] <Foxandxss> Will-k, some people have nothing to do and spamming seems to be a good way to waste time
[06:27:55] <Will-k> Yes, but you'd be surprised how much logical chat does :)
[06:28:31] <Will-k> Rational chat
[06:28:46] <Foxandxss> anyway, is weird to see that kind of garbage on freenode
[06:30:49] <Will-k> Not really
[06:30:52] <Will-k> Pretty common
[06:31:13] <Foxandxss> maybe here, Im on freenode since 2004 and rational people so far
[06:31:41] <Will-k> We need like a channel for spammers. I'd take my hat off to anyone that registered #staythefuckofffreenodeorwellkickyourasses
[06:32:07] <Foxandxss> yeha, but is not fun
[06:35:09] <JKarsrud> Foxandxss: did you manage to fix your problem? :)
[06:35:15] <Foxandxss> yep
[06:35:24] <JKarsrud> cool, good :)
[06:36:01] <Foxandxss> Im desktop developer and web dev is driving me mad, managing html, javascript / jquery, css... somethings yoyu don't know where to look to resolve a concrete problem
[06:36:10] <Foxandxss> you*
[06:38:05] <JKarsrud> yeah, that's true
[06:38:59] <JKarsrud> I've always been a web dev, so I'm having the same issues when playing around with desktop developing
[06:39:13] <JKarsrud> not that I do it that much, tho
[06:39:27] <Foxandxss> today web development is the way
[06:39:59] <Foxandxss> but desktop apps are much easier, you play around with few things, just the language of your choice + UI
[06:40:13] <Foxandxss> but you know, is all about practice
[06:40:43] <Xenefungus> Foxandxss: i have to agree, its a bigger stack to learn at first
[06:40:54] <Xenefungus> but i think it pays off
[06:41:12] <Xenefungus> especially where everyone is talking about cross platform
[06:41:17] <Xenefungus> java didnt handle it
[06:41:17] <Foxandxss> If I want to implement one thing, I have to think if that is done with CSS, html, jquery or some plugin of 10000 out there :P
[06:41:19] <Xenefungus> web apps do
[06:41:20] <Xenefungus> :)
[06:41:24] <Foxandxss> yup yup
[06:42:02] <JKarsrud> Foxandxss: yeah, but if you've done it smart from the beginning, it shouldn't be that hard really
[06:42:08] <Foxandxss> What I see good is that jquery/html/css is really cross platform and you can use what you want in server side
[06:42:20] <Foxandxss> JKarsrud, how is smart for you?
[06:43:05] <JKarsrud> like.. If you've built a nice HTML/CSS framework for instance. You know that new component will consist of this and that. .Say inputs and checkboxes
[06:43:22] <JKarsrud> Then you hook a class onto it, and then the CSS will take care of the rest
[06:43:53] <Shi> yop
[06:44:09] <damian004> hey guys
[06:44:32] <damian004> could you tell me how i can build a live chat in ajax?
[06:44:36] <JKarsrud> I made a small framework for our ecommerce backend design, with different classes to hook onto elements that defined fixed/fluent width etc
[06:45:01] <Shi> could you give me some "keywords" or "url" to find a way to protect an input field ( user needs to click on locker before writes in the field)
[06:45:29] <Foxandxss> JKarsrud, I agree, with the right tools is just filling up gaps with code
[06:45:58] <JKarsrud> damian004: not a small task, but you could look at some long polling stuff, or maybe even websockets
[06:45:58] <Foxandxss> my app have a heavy "client", I mean, more javascript code than server code
[06:46:33] <JKarsrud> yeah
[06:46:39] <damian004> so, better use flash or java?
[06:46:51] <JKarsrud> nah, use JS =)
[06:47:12] <damian004> how? without ajax?
[06:47:17] <Foxandxss> with
[06:47:23] <JKarsrud> damian004: with
[06:47:28] <Xenefungus> WAH he said flash :p
[06:47:31] <JKarsrud> check out this node.js demo; http://chat.nodejs.org/
[06:48:07] <JKarsrud> uses sockets
[06:49:17] <Foxandxss> JKarsrud, AFAIK, websockets is not supported on some major browsers, right?
[06:49:32] <Foxandxss> FF4 doesn't support it at least
[06:50:49] <damian004> interested
[06:50:53] <damian004> thx
[06:51:11] <Foxandxss> JKarsrud, are you familiarized with opacitymask concept?
[06:55:12] <JKarsrud> Foxandxss: well, ff5 is the shit now, so :P
[06:55:20] <JKarsrud> hmm, no
[06:55:46] <JKarsrud> depends on what you're talking about Foxandxss
[06:56:10] <Foxandxss> its a way to have an icon p.e. with the color you want
[06:56:28] <Foxandxss> you put in on top of a rectangle and if the rectangle is red, the icon will be red
[06:56:35] <Foxandxss> would be good to do that on a webpage
[06:57:26] <JKarsrud> ahh, right
[06:57:44] <JKarsrud> Yeah, I know that concept. Don't think i've seen it done on the web yet tho
[06:57:55] <Foxandxss> I want to put some icons on a div, but that div can be any color
[06:58:03] <Foxandxss> so if your icon is red and the div is red, fun fun
[06:58:18] <JKarsrud> but if the icon is blue
[06:58:21] <JKarsrud> not so friday
[06:58:32] <Foxandxss> yeah, blue icon and blue div? :P
[06:58:54] <JKarsrud> yeah, but if the icon is blue and the div is red
[06:58:59] <JKarsrud> :P
[06:59:08] <Foxandxss> I will limitate the user :P
[06:59:39] <Foxandxss> anyway, as a workaround I created a "floated" div with that icons when you mouseover the div
[06:59:43] <Foxandxss> meh, kinda ugly
[07:00:35] <Foxandxss> the floated div will have one color, so no problem with the icons
[07:06:32] <Foxandxss> JKarsrud, you as a long web dev. You find context menus as annoying?
[07:07:36] <Foxandxss> without the last "as" :P
[07:14:04] <motaka2> no  one there ?
[07:14:26] <Foxandxss> 765+you
[07:14:51] <Foxandxss> right click is not an option, doesnt work on ipad
[07:14:59] <motaka2> Woet:  have you seen my cod3ee?
[07:15:22] <Woet> motaka2: last thing I said is that you only have to paste relevant code
[07:15:24] <Woet> without PHP.
[07:15:43] <motaka2> Woet:    http://jsfiddle.net/donkarlo/jbh9p/1/
[07:17:42] <Xenefungus> Foxandxss: i personally like circle-menus on a touch display
[07:17:57] <Xenefungus> like, hold the finger on something for a moment, then a circle arund it appears with options
[07:17:58] <Foxandxss> Xenefungus, never heard about that thing
[07:18:14] <motaka2> Woet: Have you seen it ?
[07:18:27] <Xenefungus> i never coded it as well Foxandxss
[07:18:39] <Woet> motaka2: relevant html only....
[07:18:39] <Xenefungus> but used it on a touch-table in university
[07:18:39] <Foxandxss> but never saw it, any example?
[07:18:41] <Xenefungus> great feeling
[07:19:14] <motaka2> Woet:  but I have pasted js too
[07:19:21] <Xenefungus> i dont know where to find it. but its basically just an overlay that displays on a longer touch
[07:19:29] <Woet> motaka2: stop nick alerting me - .change works great in IE
[07:19:34] <Woet> motaka2: i've told you how to paste, i've told you how to debug
[07:19:44] <Woet> motaka2: now bring them to practice and ask this channel instead of me specifically.
[07:19:49] <Foxandxss> Xenefungus, sounds good, but I don't want to mess that much, Im newbie
[07:20:06] <motaka2> Woet:  Ok
[07:20:11] <Xenefungus> Foxandxss: ah ok. yeah, i guess thats definetely more advanced
[07:20:30] <Foxandxss> yup yup, but thanks, I will remember that
[07:20:53] <Xenefungus> Foxandxss: np, keep coding!
[07:21:46] <Xenefungus> (Foxandxss: if you've played it: now that i think of it its much like the suite-menu from crysis;-))
[07:21:50] <Foxandxss> so far so good, but I had to use alternatives, I guess I will change that on a future :P
[07:22:09] <Foxandxss> yeah, that was the first thing that came to my mind
[07:23:03] <Xenefungus> :D
[07:23:37] <Xenefungus> yap, it was basically the same, like touch, circle appeard, you move finger to one option, release
[07:23:48] <Xenefungus> and then that option would be selected
[07:24:13] <motaka2> Woet:  I have pasted allbut any way I am going to solve it myself
[07:25:21] <Foxandxss> Xenefungus, but if you release the finger and you don't hear something like "maximum power activated" I don't want it
[07:25:47] <Xenefungus> Foxandxss++ i totally see your point :)
[07:31:41] <grid_> heya
[07:33:18] <hichs> can any one tell how i give link on icon
[07:33:27] <hichs> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/BubbleNavigation/
[07:35:15] <Xenefungus> is anyone else of the opinion that the english skills in #jquery are generally…low these days? or is it just me?
[07:36:07] <grid_> 'generally…low' ?
[07:36:51] <Woet> Xenefungus is racist against foreign people!
[07:37:12] <Foxandxss> Xenefungus, if I need my jq, javascript, html, css and english skills to be high, that's difficult :P
[07:37:32] <Foxandxss> but I agree with him that sometimes is hard to understand what people says
[07:39:34] <Engin> img.load(func); img.load(function(){func();});
[07:39:42] <Engin> first ones $(this) is an img, latter one is window.
[07:39:53] <Xenefungus> Woet: yeah, totally :p
[07:39:56] <Engin> makes sense ?
[07:40:52] <Engin> how can i make the second call's this also the real source ?
[07:45:43] <motaka2> Can any one tell me why the change firesup in firefox but not IE ?   http://jsfiddle.net/donkarlo/jbh9p/2/
[07:50:17] <Bower^> Can someone please explain to me in basic terms why I can't assign the value of something (say a JSON object) to a global variable and have its value permit throughout the page's life? Something http://jsfiddle.net/e62Wt/ demonstrates my confusion
[07:50:17] <Krinkle> motaka2: please isolate the test to a simple html file. There is too much going on on this page. either send the real link to the website or a jsfiddle that doesn't contain anything but a replication of the bug.
[07:50:30] <Woet> Krinkle: i already told him that three times by now
[07:50:45] <Woet> [16:18:39] <Woet> motaka2: relevant html only....
[07:50:50] <Woet> it's not helping unfortunately
[07:51:13] <motaka2> Woet: Krinkle when I simplfy it works , in IE too
[07:51:30] <Krinkle> Bower^: Asynchronous
[07:51:35] <Woet> motaka2: so keep debugging the issue until you reproduced it on jsfiddle.
[07:51:36] <Foxandxss> so see what's the difference between the working code and the not working one
[07:51:47] <Bower^> What exactly does that mean?
[07:51:50] <Foxandxss> sometimes is just a typo
[07:51:51] <Woet> motaka2: I'll assume you have looked into the IE javascript console too?
[07:52:42] <motaka2> Woet: no I cant install it
[07:52:50] * Woet sighs deeply
[07:53:01] <Woet> motaka2: Firebug: http://www.getfirebug.com/ or Firebug Lite (for non-firefox browsers): http://www.getfirebug.com/lite.html plus Debug: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
[07:53:09] <Engin> any idea about my question ?
[07:53:48] <Woet> motaka2: and I've told you countless times now (Krinkle too), RELEVANT. HTML. ONLY.
[07:54:00] <Bower^> Krinkle, is it simply not possible to have an object persist like that?
[07:54:00] <Woet> motaka2: so keep debugging until you have a minimal jsfiddle while still having the bug.
[07:54:11] <Krinkle> Bower^: http://jsfiddle.net/e62Wt/1/
[07:54:15] <Krinkle> Bower^: It does perist
[07:54:16] <Bower^> something only lives for as long as its function call?
[07:54:22] <Engin> img.load(func); img.load(function(){func();}); // first one makes func's $(this) and image, latter one makes it Window. is it to be expected ? and how can I fix it.
[07:54:23] <Bower^> Sorry but I just find it terribly strange
[07:54:24] <Krinkle> Bower^: You're looking for it before it exists
[07:54:30] <Bower^> Oh
[07:54:53] <Krinkle> getJSON is asynchronous. That means the code continues before getJSON is ready
[07:54:56] <Krinkle> hence callbacks
[07:55:05] <Bower^> I-see!
[07:55:07] <Krinkle> otherwise the page would have to wait for getJSON to finish,
[07:55:27] <Krinkle> so where do you move "displayAlbumData()" in document.ready to, to fix it ?
[07:55:27] <Bower^> That's so helpful
[07:56:55] <Bower^> Well it makes sense to put the call to that function inside the callback function
[07:57:11] <Krinkle> Exactly
[07:57:21] <Krinkle> btw. use .text() instead of .html() otherwise there is a security leak
[07:57:22] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/e62Wt/2/
[07:57:22] <Bower^> Krinkle, you're star. thanks man
[07:57:38] <Bower^> you're a*
[07:57:48] <Bower^> ok cheers, i'll keep that in mind
[07:57:59] <Krinkle> you're welcome
[07:58:52] <Krinkle> Bower^: If you moved it to the callback, please click Update on top and send me the new link :)
[08:00:08] <Bower^> I didn't edit the fiddle, bit too cramped
[08:03:24] <Bower^> wesbos, is your name from something quite well known? I'm sure I know it from somewhere
[08:03:44] <wesbos> Bower^ HRM
[08:03:51] <wesbos> where are you from
[08:04:03] <Bower^> England
[08:04:49] <Bower^> I feel it's either from the OCUK forum or counterstrike
[08:04:56] <Bower^> probably just someone with the same name :)
[08:05:34] <wesbos> ohh hah no i dont play games
[08:05:38] <wesbos> and im from Canada
[08:05:52] <Woet> Bower keeps kidnapping peach, but he removed one of his initials to avoid being recognized.
[08:06:20] <Bower^> ? :D
[08:06:21] <bot-t1> http://i.imgur.com/HNXTm.jpg
[08:06:26] <wesbos> WERE ONTO YOU
[08:07:28] <csdco> Is it appropriate to ask a support question here?
[08:07:38] <wesbos> yes sir
[08:07:56] <csdco> I have a function that runs on a fieldset click as well as a radio button inside the fieldset.
[08:08:09] <csdco> In IE6+7 (and only those browsers) both functions are running when I click the radio button.
[08:08:17] <csdco> How can I stop the fieldset click from running?
[08:08:25] <csdco> Sorry, I meant to say I have 2 functions.
[08:08:26] <Woet> IE6 has a bug?!
[08:08:28] <csdco> :)
[08:08:34] <Bower^> lol woet :D
[08:08:43] <Woet> csdco: the best solution is a huge banner telling people not to use ancient browsers
[08:08:47] <csdco> so fieldset.click() and radio.click()
[08:08:49] <Woet> but i'll assume that's not an option?
[08:08:53] <csdco> Woet: i could not agree more, brother.
[08:09:06] <Xenefungus> yeah, just dont support old IE enymore
[08:09:06] <csdco> This project apparently *has* to support back that far. Can't understand why.
[08:09:11] <Xenefungus> best way definetely
[08:09:19] <Bower^> indeed. I wish every popular site would just stop serving up content to old browsers
[08:09:21] <Xenefungus> :(
[08:09:31] <csdco> Yea wouldn't that be a dream? Then enterprise would be forced to upgrade.
[08:09:54] <Woet> csdco: doesn't onclick just on the radio button fire on both the radio + fieldset?
[08:09:58] <csdco> So I have those 2 click events, and if I click the radio, the firldset.click also fires.
[08:10:42] <csdco> Woet: It does indeed fire both fieldset and radio functions. Altho everywhere else, only the radio function fires (desired behavior)
[08:13:15] <csdco> Or perhaps the first function just finished quickly in everything else, so the 2nd function doesn't run.
[08:14:04] <motaka2> Woet: the problem was a trailing , after an element of an object
[08:14:26] <Woet> motaka2: no way! you mean the kind of error you would see instantly with a javascript debugger or jslint?
[08:14:28] <csdco> Ohh targets! Cool.
[08:15:09] <motaka2> Woet:  but it was working with all browsers except IE
[08:15:23] <Woet> motaka2: yes, because IE doesn't accept it
[08:15:56] <motaka2> Woet:  but now the ajax request doesnt work in IE, Why IE is so strange?
[08:16:04] <Woet> motaka2: because your code is so strange.
[08:16:22] <motaka2> Woet:  what part is strange?
[08:16:47] <Woet> motaka2: line 1 till line 500
[08:17:51] <Woet> motaka2: now, start properly debugging like i've told you a million times now
[08:18:09] <Woet> motaka2: instead of wasting everyones time for hours because of an error you would have seen in the console instantly.
[08:18:44] <motaka2> woet i can instal jslite
[08:29:35] <csdco> :)
[08:35:00] <VictorCL> look anyone knows a plugin that can do this = http://www.outstock.es/  <--- when it loads the image on the left .. it applies an effect ...
[08:35:17] <VictorCL> cant find any plugin that would do something like that or similar

[09:18:53] <DerNalia> but.. what if I don't want the first item?
[09:18:54] <ajpiano> [0] returns a dom element not a jQuery object with a .text() method
[09:18:57] <DerNalia> what if I want the 6th?
[09:19:02] <DerNalia> oh
[09:19:02] <ajpiano> use .eq() instead of array notation
[09:19:05] <ajpiano> .eq(5)
[09:19:09] <DerNalia> okie

[09:28:52] <SEToChan> what is wrong with such construction var tmpl = $('#tplUserPermissions').template('template'); ?
[09:29:04] <SEToChan> $('#tplUserPermissions') is correct selector
[09:29:25] <SEToChan> but code after this string somewhy does not executed
[09:29:30] <wookiehangover> you want tmpl()
[09:29:31] <wookiehangover> ?tmpl
[09:29:33] <bot-t1> wookiehangover, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[09:32:54] <djQuery> SEToChan: userperm = {select: true, insert: false, delete: false, update: false}  var t $('$tmpUserPermisions').tmp(userperm);
[09:33:14] <djQuery> forgot the = sign there
[09:33:40] <djQuery> and that was supposed to be .tmpl(userperm);
[09:33:46] * djQuery gets more cafine
[09:35:41] <SEToChan> manual page shows following for me
[09:35:46] <SEToChan> $.tmpl($('#tplUserPermissions').template(), data).appendTo('#user_permissions')
[09:36:38] <SEToChan> this code do not throw any error but script stops after it

[10:03:58] <Germanaz0> hello everyone, someone know about datepicker ?
[10:04:11] <Germanaz0> I'm getting trubbles in the event, onbeforeshowday
[10:04:26] <Germanaz0> beforeShowDay
[10:04:36] <paul_irish> mrmist: thx for your help earlier
[10:04:51] <Germanaz0> it return me the error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[10:05:03] <Germanaz0> when I use the event
[10:10:18] <motaka2> in this code http://pastebin.com/A4QbUx0p alert works when it is in line three but doesnt work when i move it to line 10, this is the success part of an ajax call, does any one has any idea?
[10:11:25] <motaka2> Woet:  odfcourse it works in Firefox but not in IE
[10:11:36] <Woet> motaka2
[10:11:41] <Germanaz0> someone knows why the beforeShowDay on the jquery datepicker, don't work ? it throw me an error
[10:11:42] <Woet> i'm going to tell you this a final time
[10:11:47] <Woet> DEBUG. YOUR. JAVASCRIPT.
[10:12:17] <motaka2> Woet: I am debugging it using firebug lite, i dont see anything strange with it
[10:12:28] <Woet> motaka2: firebug lite doesn't show you javascript errors
[10:12:50] <motaka2> Woet: so using what should I debug it?
[10:13:07] <Woet> the internet explorer javascript debugger
[10:13:10] <Woet> as I've told you three times by now
[10:13:28] <Woet> google: "internet explorer javascript debugger" - About 16,500,000 results (0.32 seconds)
[10:13:29] <Woet> good luck
[10:13:48] <dshap> hey all quick question if you don't mind...does jQuery have a feature that allows you to execute code / call a function AFTER a greasemonkey script or browser extension has executed?
[10:13:51] <motaka2> how can I install that, i have office 2007 installed but i cant see it in internet explorer ? view menu items
[10:14:03] <Woet> this is #jquery motaka2, not #howtouseyourdesktop
[10:14:39] <motaka2> Woet:  I am sorry  but i am totally a newbie
[10:15:02] <Woet> motaka2: there is a huge difference between new to jquery but accepting advice and doing as you're told
[10:15:03] <dshap> what im trying to do is set some hidden element in the page with the version number of the greasemonkey script / browser extension, and then alert the user if their extension is not up to date by detecting that in my main page's javascript/jquery
[10:15:18] <Woet> motaka2: and being new to jquery, completely ignoring all replies, not doing any effort yourself and keep asking the same question for hours
[10:15:25] <Woet> you fall in the last category.
[10:16:00] <dshap> actually you know what im an idiot, thinking about this all wrong, please disregard my question.  thanks!
[10:16:24] <motaka2> Woet: believe me i cant get debugger to work, I dont know why , it says if you have office installed you can see it in the view menu of IE , I cant see it believe me
[10:16:59] <Woet> motaka2: then keep googling and searching until you got it to work.
[10:19:15] <motaka2> Woet: I cant see script debugger in view of internet explorer or elese i am belind!!!
[10:21:31] <Woet> [19:16:59] <Woet> motaka2: then keep googling and searching until you got it to work.
[10:21:35] <Woet> [19:14:03] <Woet> this is #jquery motaka2, not #howtouseyourdesktop
[10:32:52] <motaka2> Woet:  At last I ave it installed now how can I use it ? it works like firebug ?
[10:33:28] <Woet> [19:21:30] <Woet> [19:16:59] <Woet> motaka2: then keep googling and searching until you got it to work.
[10:33:29] <Woet> [19:21:34] <Woet> [19:14:03] <Woet> this is #jquery motaka2, not #howtouseyourdesktop
[10:33:49] <motaka2> Woet:  :D
[10:36:56] <orl> Hi!
[10:37:21] <orl> How can I change a :after content with jQuery? I thought I could do it with .css(), but looks like it's not possible.
[10:38:01] <motaka2> Woet: I know something for sure I hate microsoft I hate IE
[10:38:02] <orl> for information, I've used something like:  $(dt.:after').css('color', 'red')
[10:38:14] <orl> sorry
[10:38:17] <orl> for information, I've used something like:  $(dt:after').css('color', 'red')
[10:42:39] <mercury_> hello. im using .ajax request on some .php file with post method. when success i put the content .html to some xy div with id. in remote content i have some function which is called when the content is loaded. the problem is that function exectution loops and i dont know why. any idea. hope you understand :)
[10:43:09] <Xenefungus> mercury_: i heard that php-users are not helped here
[10:44:00] <mercury_> i dont understand. why would someone not help some specific programmers ?
[10:44:20] <Xenefungus> because no  one likes php
[10:44:22] <mercury_> what if i would use .asp, .net,... ?
[10:44:33] <Xenefungus> not sure either
[10:44:43] <mercury_> what do you mean "no one likes php" ?
[10:44:53] <mercury_> what kind of a stupid fact is that ?
[10:45:25] <bot-t1> Did you mean sarcasm?  - (noun) A form of humor that is marked by mocking with irony, sometimes conveyed in speech with vocal over-emphasis. Insincerely saying something which is the opposite of one's intended meaning, often to emphasize how unbelievable or unlikely it sounds if taken literally, thereby illustrating the obvious nature of one's intended meaning.
[10:45:58] <mercury_> if you want to use jquery you need some server side processor dont you ? and what do you personaly use ?
[10:46:58] <badabim> I don't think that there is a bais against php here. I think Xenefungus may just be chumming the waters.
[10:47:06] <badabim> s/bais/bias/
[10:47:10] <Xenefungus> ;-)
[10:47:11] <JKarsrud> mercury_: you don't need server side to use jquery, but to use ajax you'd generally need something on the server =)
[10:47:42] <mercury_> wow, this is really usefull jquery help channel i must say...
[10:47:44] <JKarsrud> is it the php function that loops, or the jquery callback that loops, btw? :)
[10:48:10] <mercury_> when i get callback it starts looping...
[10:48:15] <badabim> sounds like the jQuery function. how is it called?
[10:48:29] <tprice> hey all can someone give a hand. https://gist.github.com/0935445db7b0768804ea on line 35 i keep getting "ReferenceError"
[10:48:36] <tprice> what the hell is wrong with it
[10:48:44] <tprice> something i dont know
[10:49:53] <JKarsrud> mercury_: do you have some code? :)
[10:49:59] <mercury_> somethink eles... in this remote function is again jqeury ajax function
[10:50:12] <tprice> and this is what the test run looks like https://gist.github.com/f07577821b76bb2974b6
[10:50:43] <mercury_> so in eeg. test.html i call remote.html and in remote.html is another ajax function to remote_2.html
[10:51:15] <mercury_> in remote.html start looping remote_2.html
[10:51:46] <JKarsrud> are you including scripts etc in remote_2.html too? Shouldn't it just return the HTML you need?
[10:52:13] <mercury_> yes, in remote_2.html is script too.
[10:52:56] <mercury_> sorry!
[10:52:58] <mercury_> no, no
[10:53:04] <mercury_> in remote_2.html is nothnik
[10:53:09] <mercury_> just pure hhtml
[10:53:11] <mercury_> html
[10:54:42] <mercury_> its like that remote.html call function to remote_1.html is lopping

[11:08:45] <b1lly> im using jquery sortable and i'm trying to create 2 elements that are not sortable.
[11:08:52] <b1lly> this works for one element ----            items: "li:not(.orders_header)",
[11:09:01] <b1lly> but how do i make that work for 2 elements
[11:30:36] <intellilogic> if (this.name == Increment) {   I also want to check if this.name is a number, how to?
[11:31:09] <raiun> so im using $.makeArray on a javascript object, but its just making a 1 item array with the whole object
[11:31:17] <paul_irish> intellilogic: typeof ?
[11:31:20] <raiun> as one value
[11:32:12] <intellilogic> The real paul irish?  I was watching your 10 things you learned about jquery source... :)

[12:30:03] <bot-t> (67 hours 30 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn lurkmoar on freenoad lol
[12:30:25] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky i got gators to host
[12:30:26] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[12:30:55] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky also wiggle
[12:30:55] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[12:31:31] <abjorn> I learned this week that all of our tools at work use jquery (they're all web based)
[12:31:34] <abjorn> so thats cool
[12:32:03] <abjorn> I also learned that perl programmers dont know how to write good javascript
[12:38:48] <yogurt_truck> paul_irish: D:
[12:39:56] <yogurt_truck> abjorn: perl programmers don't know how to write good perl
[12:40:43] <abjorn> roflmao
[12:40:52] <abjorn> yeah probably why our tools are so fucking broken
[12:41:06] <abjorn> thankfully all our public facing stuff is at least PHP
[12:41:14] <abjorn> and mostly-not-broken
[12:42:53] <yogurt_truck> i've just spent two hours breaking stuff on a production server because i couldn't figure out why some new code didn't seem to be doing anything
[12:43:35] <yogurt_truck> and then my dev partner asked me if i noticed the site was faster, because he installed APC... "last night"
[12:45:06] <yogurt_truck> we're like the three stooges, in this startup

[13:07:28] <scharc> i am trying to clone a selection
[13:07:44] <scharc> but it wont clone the users selection
[13:07:52] <scharc> just the default one
[13:08:06] <scharc> same with a textarea
[13:08:59] <b1lly> is there a way to break out of a .each() loop?
[13:09:41] <scharc> b1lly: look at the api
[13:09:53] <scharc> if your callback method returns false
[13:30:51] <k_89> hey... whats the  best rich text editor out there??
[13:31:40] <k_89> anyone
[13:31:41] <bateman> not sure if it work for your project, but the trend is to use markdown if it's enough
[13:31:42] <k_89> ??
[13:33:12] <k_89> bateman, thanks, can i see a demo somewhere??
[13:33:38] <bateman> http://www.elated.com/articles/textile-markdown-nice-alternatives-to-wysiwyg-editors/
[13:35:08] <b1lly> is there a way to start a .each loop at a certain element?
[13:36:07] <tbranyen> b1lly: $("selector").slice(start, end).each
[13:36:20] <tbranyen> might be best to do something like $("div").slice(5).each(function() { });
[13:36:24] <b1lly> start,end would be the index?
[13:36:32] <tbranyen> well you can omit end
[13:36:38] <tbranyen> if you just want to start at a specific indx
[13:36:48] <tbranyen> ?slice
[13:36:49] <bot-t> .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[13:36:50] <b1lly> ok and how would i return an index of a specific element
[13:36:54] <b1lly> within the loops
[13:37:04] <b1lly> err list of elements*
[13:37:20] <tbranyen> use map instead of each?
[13:37:26] <tbranyen> and return all the elements you want in the array?
[13:37:31] <Foxandxss> each have a parameter that is the index, nO?
[13:37:34] <tbranyen> ?map @ b1lly
[13:37:34] <bot-t> b1lly, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[13:37:43] <b1lly> well for example
[13:37:43] <Foxandxss> each(function(index, item) or something like that
[13:37:53] <b1lly> the .each.slice is what i want
[13:38:03] <Germanaz0> hey what's the best way to convert a date to timestamp in JS
[13:38:05] <Foxandxss> .slice.each*
[13:38:16] <Germanaz0> bcs the math.round(date.getTime() / 1000 )
[13:38:17] <Germanaz0> sucks
[13:38:21] <tbranyen> Germanaz0: you already have the date?
[13:38:25] <k_89> billy, $('selector') returns an array of selected elements, let the array be arr, if you want to dod jquery stuff on 5th selected thing, fo this: $(arr[4]).functionToDoWhatever()
[13:38:25] <tbranyen> is it an object?
[13:38:31] <Germanaz0> yes tbranyen
[13:38:39] <tbranyen> Germanaz0: just coerce it with +
[13:38:49] <tbranyen> var myDate = new Date(); var timestamp = +myDate;
[13:38:51] <b1lly> lets say i have 5 elements with the class "hi"... the 4th one has an id of "yo"... is it possible to return the index of the "yo" within the list of 5 elements
[13:39:06] <b1lly> i basically want the each loop to start at the "yo"
[13:39:18] <b1lly> but loop through the "hi" class elements
[13:39:40] <Germanaz0> not work tbranyen
[13:40:08] <k_89> billy ,wait for a min or 2
[13:40:32] <tbranyen> Germanaz0: then its not a date object
[13:40:51] <Germanaz0> yes it is
[13:40:56] <Germanaz0> I do console log of the date tbranyen
[13:40:58] <tbranyen> http://sharefilewith.me/u/0fba40.png
[13:40:59] <Germanaz0> Mon Aug 01 2011 17:39:19 GMT-0300 (ART)
[13:41:07] <Germanaz0> when I do the console log of the timestamp
[13:41:14] <Germanaz0> 4841312231159
[13:41:17] <tbranyen> yeah
[13:41:19] <Germanaz0> its not the same date
[13:41:20] <tbranyen> thats a timestamp...
[13:41:25] <tbranyen> yes it is :)
[13:41:54] <Germanaz0> the date of that timestamp is Fri, 28 Jan 155385 09:05:59 GMT
[13:41:55] <tbranyen> you can convert it back with new Date(timestamp) and you'll see, it is in fact, the same date
[13:42:35] <tbranyen> wait what... you're doing something messed up
[13:42:37] <tbranyen> jsfiddle it
[13:43:30] <Bower^> um, how do you link js and css from the html when you fiddle it? say i have my js and css in the directories js and css? sorry for the newb question :D
[13:43:56] <Bower^> i've pasted it into the respective windows but it can't "see it"
[13:44:20] <b1lly> is it possible to include 2 elements within a .each loop
[13:44:39] <b1lly> like ('.class1, .class2').each
[13:45:28] <systemfault> I would try it ;)
[13:46:03] <tbranyen> Germanaz0: http://jsfiddle.net/tbranyen/3RFaH/
[13:46:06] <tbranyen> check your console
[13:46:20] <AndroUser2> ?eval !!1
[13:46:21] <bot-t> AndroUser2: true
[13:46:24] <k_89> billy, http://pastebin.com/kQVjVmtJ , most probably this will work
[13:46:47] <k_89> also, billy, $('.class1, .class2').each works
[13:47:00] <Germanaz0> ah tbranyen
[13:47:06] <Germanaz0> if I would like to process on php
[13:47:07] <Bower^> http://jsfiddle.net/v5wxf/ - why doesn't the JS work here? I don't mean for my specific problem but it only works if I paste the javascript into a <script> element within the html
[13:47:10] <Germanaz0> I have to divide by 1000
[13:47:17] <Germanaz0> timestamp/1000
[13:47:26] <tbranyen> right on
[13:47:27] <tbranyen> yea
[13:47:37] <k_89> billy, but my code is the most efficient code i could think of
[13:49:33] <Bower^> Sorry perhaps I'm not being clear. In regards to pasting code into jsfiddle.net, why can't it see the script I've pasted into the javascript window but it can see the CSS fine? - http://jsfiddle.net/v5wxf/
[13:49:42] <Bower^> I'm pretty new with fiddle
[14:17:14] <Bower^> http://jsfiddle.net/v5wxf/1/ - I'm very new to javascript/jquery and I would really appreciate an explanation on that code I've wirrten. I would expect the global variable artistDiscography to still be alive when it is accessed by the function called when the user clicks the text it is associated with but it is null at that point. Now I could write the mbid of the albums when I write the initial list of album names to some hidden text but that seems really ha
[14:17:14] <Bower^> cky.
[14:18:08] <Bower^> Does that make any sense? hehe
[14:19:53] <Bower^> Oh, the fiddle won't work as it makes use of a web API
[14:20:03] <Bower^> The code is pretty simple though
[14:21:30] <scorphus> how do I define the onClick to be a common method?
[14:21:59] <scorphus> $('div').click(class.method);
[14:22:07] <scorphus> that does't work
[14:25:57] <systemfault> scorphus: Wrap it in a closure or use $.proxy
[14:26:39] <systemfault> indirect calls on a "class" function(if you call it as such) lose their "this"
[14:33:13] <scorphus> systemfault: a brief look into that didn't help, the deadline is in sight, so the only option I have is duplicate the same function body for every element's click()
[14:33:21] <scorphus> but thanks anyway
[14:35:02] <scorphus> systemfault: here is the code, btw: http://pastebin.com/ntLsY5ua
[14:35:05] <scorphus> line 34
[14:35:28] <scorphus> this.CheckAll is on line 68
[14:36:38] <piyushmishra> is there any not select for attributes?
[14:37:12] <piyushmishra> I see [name != "value"] is there any [!name]
[14:37:41] <systemfault> No, but there's a :not() selector...
[14:37:49] <scorphus> piyushmishra: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[14:38:09] <systemfault> scorphus: .click(function() { this.CheckAll(); });
[14:38:29] <scorphus> systemfault: I didn't think of that, let me see
[14:38:57] <systemfault> ?eval $.proxy(console.log, console)("Hello");
[14:38:58] <bot-t> systemfault: "Hello"
[14:39:19] <systemfault> .click($.proxy(this.CheckAll,  this)); should also work
[14:39:51] <systemfault> Ahhh it won't work.
[14:40:15] <systemfault> Because the "this" in the .each isn't the same "this" as your object
[14:41:31] <systemfault> So just after: this.Build = function(data) {, write "var that = this;" then you can use any of the two preceding solution replacing "this" with "that" :P
[14:44:37] <scorphus> systemfault: exactly that, but I did    var myObj = this;    instead =/
[14:44:45] <systemfault> :)
[14:44:45] <scorphus> kinda ugly IMO
[14:45:01] <systemfault> blame jQuery.
[14:45:09] <scorphus> =)
[14:45:30] <scorphus> thank you for looking into that, systemfault :)
[14:45:36] <systemfault> You're welcome
[15:19:36] <Camer0n> how do i say or in jquery??
[15:23:03] <grid_> i'm using a very simple cookie script, it will store a cookie, that actually works too, now i want to store it in a var, it must show an alert after that, there it goes wrong, this would return the cookie value: $.cookie('the_cookie'); here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/bf4gr/
[15:34:03] <Swannie> Hello jQuery peoples.
[15:34:59] <grid_> yoo
[15:35:06] <systemfault> Haha
[15:36:38] <Swannie> I'm loading jQuery UI with jquery.getScript, which I understand to be async. and then go off and make a bunch of ajax requests. Is there a nice way to block on jQueryUI being loaded, before I start using it in my ajax callbacks?
[15:37:37] <systemfault> Then don't use getScript?
[15:38:46] <paul_irish> Swannie: getScript has a callback
[15:38:55] <paul_irish> you want to start up your XHRs from that callback
[15:38:59] <Swannie> but then I'd have to block on jQueryUI before firing off my ajax requests. jqueryUI /usually/ loads before my ajax returns.
[15:39:52] <paul_irish> Swannie: that's the easiest approach ^ but you could also parallelize all these if you want to make it more complicated for yoruself
[15:42:53] <Swannie> paul_irish: I'm thinking the more complicated approach :-) I was considering a "function tryUI (callback) { if ( ! $.ui ) { setTimeout(tryUI(),100); } else { callback(); }"
[15:43:10] <systemfault> That's just awful :'(
[15:43:17] <paul_irish> its actually not that bad
[15:43:17] <Swannie> that's what I though :D
[15:43:27] <paul_irish> you get the parallelized downloads
[15:43:32] <Swannie> hence coming here and seeing if it's as nasty as it feels
[15:43:40] <paul_irish> and your XHR payloads are ready just waiting for the UI script to be all set up
[15:43:49] <systemfault> paul_irish: You don't find that a bit.. "hackish" though?
[15:43:59] <paul_irish> you could write an abstraction that does that
[15:44:10] <paul_irish> but.. w/e
[15:44:12] <paul_irish> im fine with it
[15:45:26] <Swannie> well actually, I was going to set a global in hte getScript callback, and then while(!set) { //loop }, but that's really nasty
[15:45:37] <paul_irish> NO
[15:45:40] <Swannie> :D
[15:45:42] <paul_irish> I WILL PUNCH YOU
[15:45:45] <Swannie> LOL
[15:45:55] <paul_irish> ?g paul irish practice polling
[15:45:56] <bot-t> paul_irish, Best practice: Poll instead of a setTimeout hack  Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2008/best-practice-poll-instead-of-a-settimeout-hack/
[15:46:00] <chjj> swannie: that wont work
[15:46:02] <Swannie> Yeah, after 30s I realised that was supper evil
[15:46:10] <paul_irish> heh its actually poll WITH a settimeout hack
[15:46:29] <Swannie> chjj: why wouldn't it work?
[15:46:38] <chjj> because js is single threaded
[15:46:47] <chjj> that will block forever
[15:46:58] <chjj> while (true); blocks everything, forever
[15:47:16] <paul_irish> ?eval while(true); 5;
[15:47:19] <bot-t> paul_irish: No output. (Process Killed)
[15:47:33] <paul_irish> FOREVERR
[15:48:27] <Swannie> ahhh, of course. *dzzzt*
[15:48:32] <Swannie> #fail
[15:48:32] <chjj> i prefer coding with callbacks anyway
[15:48:46] <paul_irish> async is for lovers
[15:48:53] <chjj> :)
[15:49:02] * Swannie gives up and blocks on jqueryUI loading for now
[15:49:37] <chjj> if code is too linear it looks ugly to me
[15:49:52] <chjj> i like how callbacks force you to think functionally
[15:50:13] <chjj> force you to organize your code better
[15:51:10] <Swannie> paul_irish: Ahh, I see you have abstracted this concept away in that function of yours (executeWhenLoaded)
[15:52:55] <paul_irish> yeah
[15:52:57] <paul_irish> ignore that shit
[15:53:03] <paul_irish> it was a terribleidea
[15:56:14] <Swannie> :P
[15:57:28] <Swannie> ok, thanks all.
[15:57:34] <systemfault> Chrome Canary should allow me to make it my default browser :'( (I love bleeding edge)
[15:57:42] <Swannie> That was faster than figuring out how bad this stuff was myself
[15:58:17] <chjj> systemfault: even chrome dev is too much for me now
[15:58:27] <chjj> :(
[15:58:32] <chjj> too unstable
[15:58:36] <chjj> for my tastes
[15:58:54] <chjj> i switched to using chrome beta because im evil
[15:58:58] <systemfault> LO
[15:59:01] <systemfault> * :P
[16:00:33] <systemfault> Ah.. just found a way on OSX :P
[16:01:07] <Bower^> I'm pulling some data from a web API using getJSON(). This is fine but I want to retain the data pulled from the server for later interactions. It seems once the callback function terminates the reference to the JSON obj is null. How can I retain this data?
[16:01:37] <chjj> there *is* no way on osx
[16:01:41] <chjj> !
[16:01:59] <systemfault> chjj: Yeah, thanks to.. safari
[16:02:38] <systemfault> chjj: While the button is disabled on canary, you can open safari, go to the settings and set canary as the default browser :P
[16:02:43] <symaxian> What are the arguments on the easing functions?
[16:02:55] <symaxian> I cant gather much from single characters
[16:03:45] <chjj> systemfault: i actually have no idea what you were referring to, i just felt like insulting osx
[16:03:54] <systemfault> Ah!
[16:03:58] <chjj> :)
[16:05:30] <systemfault> Bower^: Not sure I get the problem.. getJSON returns an object, just use it or copy it?
[16:06:29] <systemfault> To make a real copy, take a look at $.extend
[16:13:44] <Bower^> systemfault, sorry I'm really new to this. So if I have some global variable, say "var jsonObj" and within some function I execute jsonObj = $.getJSON(parms); jsonObj will retain the data for further interactions (i.e. if i have a button on the page that can then access data jsonObj, it won't be null)?
[16:14:41] <systemfault> Bower^: If jsonObj is within scope, sure... also $getJSON is async so be careful ;)
[16:15:08] <Bower^> OK lovely. This is making a bit more sense, thanks
[16:15:25] <systemfault> Perhaps you're trying to access jsonObj while the $.getJSON hasn't returned yet..
[16:15:37] <systemfault> That's why all XHR calls have callbacks.
[16:15:57] <systemfault> (getJSON/getScript/get/post...)
[16:19:14] <Bower^> it's not that systemfault. it's when i try access the data once the callback function terminates but i was initiall just doing $getJSON() and doin stuff through the callback but in this instance I need the data retained
[16:19:51] <Bower^> it didn't actually click in my head that .getJSON() would return an obj
[16:20:30] <systemfault> Well, the name of the function can be misleading.
[16:21:09] <Bower^> :P
[16:38:27] <paul_irish> http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/ this post is paul irish approved
[16:39:15] <chjj> let me see if i approve...
[16:39:36] <paul_irish> kay
[16:39:48] <chjj> tldr
[16:40:18] <chjj> no mention of the amazing non-standard __proto__, fail!
[16:40:33] <chjj> __proto__ needs to be standardized
[16:40:34] <chjj> like now
[16:40:56] <systemfault> The fail is that even though ES5 is cool, we can't use it thanks to IE.
[16:41:25] <chjj> es5 wouldve been cooler if it had __proto__, or setPrototypeOf or something
[16:41:27] <paul_irish> we can use most of it
[16:41:52] <paul_irish> chjj: did you just #fail something?
[16:41:53] <paul_irish> srsly?
[16:42:00] <chjj> i guess?
[16:42:14] <chjj> i hope i didnt fail at something, im not a failer
[16:42:15] <paul_irish> whats up 2009
[16:42:26] <chjj> :(
[16:42:38] <chjj> i guess i failed at not failing things
[16:42:44] <paul_irish> ^_^
[16:43:24] <paul_irish> chjj: so through Object.create and getPrototypeOf we can duplicate proto's functionality cant we?
[16:43:43] <chjj> not quite, theres no way to set an object's prototype after the fact
[16:43:49] <systemfault> Not as flexible as __proto__
[16:44:08] <paul_irish> aye
[16:44:17] <systemfault> IMHO, I think that the flexibility provided by __proto__ is bad but heh...
[16:44:27] <chjj> nonsense
[16:44:32] <paul_irish> it's probably also terrible for perf
[16:44:49] <chjj> yeah, if it were standardized maybe some more effort could be put into it though
[16:45:07] <systemfault> chjj: Give me a real usecase of setting __proto_ after an object's creation?
[16:45:13] <systemfault> Beside "for the lulz"
[16:45:27] <chjj> i wrote a constructor the other day that could spit out callable objects/functions, wouldnt have been possible without proto
[16:45:48] <chjj> another really cool use
[16:46:16] <chjj> for example, i think this is done in express too, but in my own node framework
[16:46:38] <chjj> you can have a child apps settings easily inherit from a parents app, app.settings.__proto__ = parent.settings;
[16:46:41] <chjj> if need be
[16:46:53] <chjj> it has a lot of uses that arent easily expressed or explained
[16:47:03] <systemfault> I guess :)
[16:47:15] <systemfault> I still think that Object.create fills most of the needs
[16:47:15] <chjj> people always challenge me too, when i advocate for proto
[16:47:38] <chjj> yeah, __proto__ looks better though, i like the aesthetics of it, especially for inheritence
[16:47:49] <chjj> child.prototype.__proto__ = parent.prototype;
[16:47:53] <chjj> doesnt get nicer than that
[16:47:54] <swiggy> could someone help me with this:http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/cBfpg/1/ -- I am trying to have whenever a checkbox is checked/unchecked it be updated in the textarea but in the exact order that it shows on the list aswell.
[16:48:03] <systemfault> I'm not a fan the how you're forced to use the defineproperty syntax for the 2nd argument of Object.create though
[16:48:05] <swiggy> http://mymo.nexxonline.com/text.html
[16:48:14] <swiggy> shows kind of what im trying to do
[16:48:51] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I want to .load() at the same time as I .fadeOut(). When BOTH finish, I want to do something. How?
[16:49:09] <swiggy> min|dvir|us use $.ajax
[16:49:11] <chjj> __proto__ just really makes you acknowledge that everything is just an object, it really brings out the oo beauty of js imo
[16:49:19] <min|dvir|us> swiggy: Why?
[16:49:33] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Check promises
[16:49:33] <harpal> I am using jquery-ui buttons in dataTable jQuery plugin, When I move to next page, it doesnt change button to jQuery-ui.
[16:49:36] <swiggy> so you can use the beforeSend, success, error, and other events
[16:49:47] <min|dvir|us> swiggy: I can do that either way.
[16:50:02] <harpal> How to trigger, jQuery-ui event when page change in dataTable plugin??
[16:50:08] <swiggy> $.ajax({ success: function(data){ $('#div').html(data).fadeOut(); });
[16:50:32] <min|dvir|us> swiggy: You totally got the wrong idea.
[16:50:42] <min|dvir|us> I want to fade out and load at the same time.
[16:50:47] <min|dvir|us> I don't want to fade out after I load.
[16:50:53] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: I'll check it out.
[16:50:55] <swiggy> .load().fadeOut() then
[16:51:30] <swiggy> you can combine functions..
[16:51:31] <min|dvir|us> swiggy: Word of advice, if you don't know the answer, don't answer. It hurts more than helps.
[16:51:40] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: I think jQuery call them "deferred", check that http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[16:51:46] <swiggy> why dont you explain your question better
[16:51:59] <min|dvir|us> swiggy: Nah. :)
[16:52:36] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: Ahh, .when(). Thanks!
[16:52:44] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: You're welcome
[16:53:43] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/cBfpg/1/ -- how do i get the value of the checkboxes to show up in the textarea in the exact order that they show in the list (if they are checked)?
[16:53:54] <Bower^> systemfault, are you sure .getJSON() returns the same object you get as a parameter in the callback function? i.e $.getJSON(apiURL, {//param}, function(thejsonData){//do stuff with jsonData})
[16:53:56] <swiggy> http://mymo.nexxonline.com/text.html -- is sort of what im going for
[16:54:09] <min|dvir|us> jQuery is fucking awesome.
[16:54:21] <min|dvir|us> Javascript should have been jQuery.
[16:54:33] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Eww no way.
[16:54:35] <djQuery> swiggy: in the order that they are checked or in the order that they appear on the screen?
[16:54:46] <systemfault> But jquery is useful :)
[16:54:57] <swiggy> in the order that they appear on the screen, but only if they are checked
[16:55:05] <systemfault> Bower^: Returns?
[16:55:16] <swiggy> http://mymo.nexxonline.com/text.html shows what i mean
[16:55:31] <djQuery> swiggy: in the order they appear on the screen just loop through all the $('input').find(':checked').each(function(){ })
[16:55:43] <swiggy> exactly what i was looking for
[16:55:50] <swiggy> i kept doing $(input:checked)
[16:55:54] <swiggy> but wasnt returning anything
[16:55:56] <swiggy> rt
[16:55:58] <swiggy> ty *
[16:56:32] <djQuery> swiggy: just do that in a change function of the checkbox
[16:57:01] <djQuery> $('input:checked') should work as well but may be a little slower
[16:58:00] <Bower^> I asked you if I could declare some global var and assign the JSON data obtained from the getJSON() call like jsonData = $.getJSON(apiURL, {//params}, function(data){}) and you said yea it returns an object
[16:58:40] <Bower^> Did I misunderstand?
[16:58:41] <swiggy> $('input').find(':checked').each(function(){
[16:58:42] <swiggy>            console.log($(this).val());
[16:58:42] <swiggy>         });
[16:58:47] <swiggy> isnt returning anything
[16:59:22] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/cBfpg/3/
[16:59:55] <Bower^> I just want the bloody data you get when in the scope of the function(data){//scope here} to persist throughout the page's life
[17:01:15] <Bower^> If I were to say declare that the global var = data within that scope, the reference becomes null once the function terminates :/ Is copying the object the only way or am I missing some language feature? I am pretty noob :D
[17:01:35] <systemfault> Bower^: Show us some code :(
[17:04:54] <Bower^> systemfault, http://jsfiddle.net/C5Dn9/ - that's what I'm playing with at the moment. It won't work on fiddle though. I assume it's because of the API calls
[17:05:00] <min|dvir|us> Is it possible to only load #jqueryselector from a URL using .ajax()?
[17:05:06] <Bower^> code is simple though dude
[17:05:19] <Bower^> brb
[17:06:34] <systemfault> Bower^: What do you think getJSON returns^
[17:06:35] <systemfault> ?
[17:06:50] <ajpiano> Bower^: you're setting the variable "discography" to contain a reference to the jQuery jqXHR object instead of the actual response data
[17:07:32] <min|dvir|us> Any thoughts?
[17:07:39] <int_64> hello
[17:07:58] <Bower^> systemfault, nothing initially, I just thought you done shit through the callback. Then I thought it returned "data"
[17:07:59] <int_64> I have a question about plugins...I want to add a function that can only be called if a selector was initialized with my plugin
[17:08:03] <int_64> Is this possible?
[17:08:06] <Bower^> Now I have no idea :D
[17:08:46] <systemfault> Bower^: The returned data will _in_ the callback, async programming can be a bit unatural at first
[17:08:49] <Bower^> I assume this jqXHR obj has some method to return the data in the proper JSON format?
[17:08:53] <int_64> for example.. $("#myDiv").initMyPlugin();
[17:09:00] <int_64> $("#myDiv").foo();
[17:09:03] <int_64> that would be legal
[17:09:18] <int_64> but $("#otherDiv").foo() would not be legal, since i didnt initialize it with my plugin
[17:09:25] <systemfault> Bower^: So.. in the callback, discography = data;
[17:09:35] <ajpiano> Bower^: this should do the trick http://jsfiddle.net/C5Dn9/2/
[17:09:43] <Bower^> That's what I done at first
[17:09:50] <min|dvir|us> Is it possible to only load #jqueryselector from a URL using .ajax()?
[17:09:58] <ajpiano> int_64: you can use jQuery.sub to do something similar to that, but not that
[17:10:06] <Bower^> but once I try interact with discography at a later point, say through a button that then appears, discography is null
[17:10:07] <int_64> thanks for the response ajpiano
[17:10:10] <int_64> I will google that now
[17:10:17] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: not by default, you can just do that type of filtering in the callbacks
[17:10:23] <ajpiano> int_64: it won't work just quite right
[17:10:23] <Bower^> reference is null once callback terminates
[17:10:28] <min|dvir|us> Figured. Thanks, ajpiano.
[17:10:31] <Bower^> ajpiano, i'll cehck that out
[17:10:35] <ajpiano> cause you'll have to do $yourJQuerySub(element).foo()
[17:10:53] <harpal> /j #mysql
[17:11:23] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/cBfpg/3/   -- any ideas why my .each() isnt returning values?
[17:12:28] <ajpiano> swiggy: filter, not find
[17:12:34] <djQuery> swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/cBfpg/4/
[17:12:42] <djQuery> check your length next time
[17:12:49] <misterm> swiggy: a good way to debug something like that is to log the length of your selector
[17:12:54] <Bower^> ajpiano, that seems a bit weird to me. is that a common solution?
[17:12:56] <swiggy> ty djQuery
[17:13:05] <ajpiano> Bower^: it's just using the deferred nature of ajax calls
[17:13:12] <ajpiano> which i suspect is probably a bit over your head at the moment :/
[17:13:24] <Bower^> it's certainly new
[17:13:41] <ajpiano> Bower^: a better solution is not to treat the global scope like your personal dumping ground
[17:13:46] <ajpiano> keep an application namespace
[17:13:53] <ajpiano> when the data is retruned, store it there
[17:13:59] <int_64> ajpiano,  does Jquery UI provide ways of doing what I want?
[17:14:00] <Bower^> Hmm I have no idea what that is
[17:14:00] <ajpiano> and reference it from there later on
[17:14:18] <Bower^> Sounds ideal though
[17:14:26] <ajpiano> Bower^: var myApp = {};  myApp.discography = {};
[17:14:30] <Bower^> I do literally just need a place to reference that data from at a later point
[17:14:31] <djQuery> var myVars = {} then later stick every thing in myVars.test = true
[17:14:41] <Bower^> Like writing stuff in hidden divs but less lame
[17:14:59] <ajpiano> int_64: sort of... the methods aren't available as $(foo).bar()... rather $(foo).whatever("bar");
[17:15:07] <int_64> ah
[17:15:09] <int_64> string refs
[17:15:16] <ajpiano> not *only* string refs
[17:15:26] <ajpiano> you can do $("foo").data("widgetname").callSomeMethod();
[17:15:38] <int_64> I see
[17:15:46] <int_64> that is fairly elegant
[17:15:52] <int_64> compared to a string ref on the function I guess
[17:16:02] <int_64> I could create an extra closure just to hold functions
[17:16:07] <int_64> and add it by the data function
[17:16:09] <int_64> I guess
[17:16:29] <int_64> or something along those lines
[17:17:34] <int_64> anyway thanks for clearing thigns up
[17:17:40] <int_64> I guess there is no really clean way to do it
[17:22:48] <ciss> hi
[17:23:51] <ciss> is there some kind of "version control" plugin for jquery, that can keep track of dynamically added scripts and changes to certain objects?
[17:25:05] <misterm> ciss: can you be more specific about what you need?
[17:26:33] <paul_irish> http://eng.wealthfront.com/2011/08/type-safe-jquery-with-st-js.html o.O
[17:27:09] <ciss> misterm: i need to control which scripts have already been added (to avoid loading them twice), as well as reverting an object to a previous state
[17:27:17] <min|dvir|us> Given HTML text, how do I get an element from it?
[17:28:13] <misterm> ciss: well for the first one, you'd probably use some sort of feature detection to check if a given script is loaded yet, the latter one is too vague for me to give useful advice on
[17:28:23] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: $(htmlstring)[0]
[17:28:41] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: What is [0]?
[17:28:55] <ajpiano> getting the first element in the collection you just created
[17:28:58] <min|dvir|us> I know that.
[17:29:02] <min|dvir|us> What specifically is it?
[17:29:11] <ajpiano> it's whatever the first element in the set you created is
[17:29:18] <ajpiano> i'm not a clairvoyant :)
[17:29:34] <misterm> ciss: what are the scripts and how are you loading them? Exactly what you do will depend on that.
[17:29:38] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I see. I want to use a jQuery selector on the generated DOM.
[17:29:49] <ajpiano> so then don't do [0]
[17:29:56] <ajpiano> $(htmlString).find("selector")
[17:29:57] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Right on. What do I do?
[17:30:01] <min|dvir|us> Ahh, cool.
[17:30:06] <ajpiano> or .filter()
[17:30:18] <ajpiano> depending on the dom structure of the string you're passing
[17:30:48] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: What is the condition?
[17:31:03] <ajpiano> if you have multiple top level elements and you're trying to get only certain ones
[17:31:12] <ajpiano> or you're trying to look inside of the top level elements for descendants
[17:31:19] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Hmm. .filter() works but .find() doesn't.
[17:31:34] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I'm getting an ID from an entire HTML document.
[17:31:38] <ajpiano> ...wat
[17:31:59] <ajpiano> you can't pass an entire html document to $() and have it work right
[17:32:09] <ajpiano> i mean, it'll sorta work out of the box, but not "right"
[17:32:27] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: OK, what do I do, then?
[17:32:36] <ajpiano> debug :)
[17:32:39] <min|dvir|us> I need an element from an entire HTML doc.
[17:32:44] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: .filter() works.
[17:32:49] <ajpiano> so then use filter
[17:32:50] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I want The Right Way.
[17:32:59] <ajpiano> the cases for filter and find are pretty much opposite
[17:33:02] <ajpiano> .find isn't "the right way"
[17:33:11] <ajpiano> it's the "right way" if you're looking inside of the top level elements
[17:33:21] <misterm> paul_irish: where'd you find this link?
[17:33:21] <ajpiano> .filter is the "right way" if you're filtering the top level elements in the collection
[17:33:39] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: You just said that $(an_entire_html_document) won't work.
[17:34:12] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#htmldoc
[17:34:12] <Bower^> ajpiano, I'm not sure what "var myApp = {};  myApp.discography = {};" actually means (I'm very new to javascript). I am reading links now and I can see that I'm doing it wrong. If you have a spare moment could you please edit the following fiddle to use your suggestion -  http://jsfiddle.net/C5Dn9/
[17:34:19] <ciss> misterm: i'm working on a module for drupal 6 that supports inline editing by dynamically loading form widgets. this is done by building the complete form internally and then disabling user access to certain parts which practically disables rendering of those elements. still every script of every widget gets added to drupals js assets registry that i query, effectively including everything (there's no safe way to link a script file to a specific
[17:34:20] <ciss> widget).
[17:34:30] <Bower^> Would help me relate it to something
[17:34:43] <TeddyMurray> hey, i have a php script that accepts a variable named "cart-action"
[17:34:50] <TeddyMurray> but jquery is complaining about the - in the var name
[17:35:38] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7784
[17:36:07] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: (closed bug: invalid)
[17:36:11] <ciss> misterm:  furthermore, drupal uses a registry object "Drupal.settings" that stores settings for form widgets. inline script rendered by a widget *might* modify this object in ways that make it contain wrong/incompatible information when loading another widget
[17:36:17] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: because we don't support the usecase in jQuery
[17:36:25] <ajpiano> so we say use the plugin
[17:36:27] <ajpiano> i'm just giving you the background
[17:36:29] <Kyoorius> is jquery ui compatible with jquery 1.6 onwards?
[17:36:32] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I understand.
[17:36:33] <ciss> misterm: information is added to this object via extend()
[17:36:42] <TeddyMurray> any ideas?
[17:36:47] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I'd rather not use a plugin.
[17:36:51] <min|dvir|us> Should I just use .filter()?
[17:37:00] <min|dvir|us> Is it prone to failure in my use case?
[17:37:11] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: the "right way" is to debug and inspect the contents of what you get back from $(yourhtmlstring) and traverse it using find or filter as appropriate for the dom structure you have been returned
[17:37:14] <ajpiano> it is as simple as that
[17:37:15] <misterm> ciss: it sounds like you need to deep-copy the settings object, so you can restore it later if needbe
[17:37:27] <ajpiano> i am attempting to disabuse you of the notion that find is right and filter is wrong.
[17:37:40] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Consider me disabused.
[17:37:44] <ajpiano> woo \o/
[17:38:03] <min|dvir|us> They'
[17:38:10] <min|dvir|us> They have different use cases.
[17:38:27] <min|dvir|us> But the way I see it, the use case for find is closer to what I'm doing.
[17:38:51] <ciss> misterm: thanks, that's a pointer i can work with. what about the script files? is there a straight forward way to avoid duplicate inclusion?
[17:38:52] <ajpiano> but since you're sending an entire html string, you're not actually getting the structure you're expecting back
[17:39:00] <ajpiano> because of the beahviour described in 7784
[17:39:17] <misterm> ciss: it depends on precisely what the scripts are and precisely how you are loading them
[17:39:53] <TeddyMurray> http://pastebin.com/iTPXAbcy -- its saying that the - in cart-action is invalid
[17:39:59] <misterm> ciss: if you're using say a script loader, some of them offer options for setting dependencies/order...if they are scripts you wrote yourself, you can include callbacks/flags in them to determine what's loaded
[17:39:59] <TeddyMurray> how can i use that name in jquery?
[17:40:19] <misterm> ciss: if they are scripts you didn't write, and you're just using a simple loader,
[17:40:34] <TeddyMurray> D:
[17:40:39] <misterm> ciss: I think feature detection is probably your only option
[17:41:37] <TeddyMurray> "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier"
[17:42:15] <andraskende> Hello, can you tell me how to get "Some" from this string:  <a href="/contact">Some</a>   Thanks !
[17:42:15] <ciss> misterm: i was thinking of a "brute-force" way using $('script[src]') and comparing the src attribute
[17:42:20] <TeddyMurray> andraskende, $('a').html(); but you should probably give it an id
[17:42:42] <ciss> how does jQuery.load() work? does it eval the loaded script, or does it create additional script elements?
[17:43:07] <misterm> ciss: yea, something like that may work, though that only tests the existence of the script element not neccesarrily that it is loaded
[17:43:15] <TeddyMurray> ajpiano, could you take a minute to look at my pastebin? its like 5 lines :)
[17:44:22] <ajpiano> Bower^: this is for example purposes only http://jsfiddle.net/C5Dn9/3/ i don't guarantee it works, it's meant to illustrate the concepts i'm talking about
[17:44:24] <andraskende> TeddyMurray: It worked, Thank You !!!
[17:44:28] <TeddyMurray> np
[17:44:31] <ciss> misterm: could be combined with an onload handler
[17:44:45] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: put quotes around it
[17:44:52] <TeddyMurray> ajpiano, single quotes?
[17:44:55] <ajpiano> {"cart-action": "true"}
[17:44:56] <TeddyMurray> i tried that D:
[17:44:56] <ajpiano> either type
[17:45:01] <TeddyMurray> ill try again
[17:45:02] <Bower^> Appreciated ajpiano, I'll just use it as a reference. Thanks
[17:45:24] <ajpiano> Bower^ http://jsfiddle.net/C5Dn9/4/ even, 3 had a dumb typo
[17:45:49] <ajpiano> Bower^, in fact, http://jsfiddle.net/C5Dn9/5/
[17:45:51] <ajpiano> sorry bout that :)
[17:45:56] <Bower^> hehe np :D
[17:46:02] <misterm> ciss: yea you can combine a few techniques, but I think they all amount to some sort of feature detection to cover all bases
[17:46:41] <ciss> sorry, i didn't mean load(), but getScript()
[17:46:51] <TeddyMurray> hmm, ajpiano it worked lol, weirddd
[17:46:53] <TeddyMurray> maybe my ftp failed
[17:46:56] <TeddyMurray> thanks :)
[17:47:21] <misterm> ciss: ultimately what's going to matter to you is that something exists, say whether the function foo.widget() exists, if it doesnt check if you've already tried to load the script and then take the appropriate action
[17:48:12] <paul_irish> misterm: i subscribe to their rss

[18:11:12] <Kyoorius> how do i check when all ajax has been completed on the page?
[18:15:48] <Kyoorius> or better yet... can someone tell me a good way of creating some kind of event to fire up my processing function when all asynchronous stuff has been completed on the page
[18:18:00] <Bower^> Does all "asynchronous stuff" in jquery have this callback functionality? I'm pretty new
[18:18:58] <Bower^> If it does then every callback could call some function that increments some variable and once the threshold has been reached then do whatever
[18:19:30] <Kyoorius> Bower: those were my initial thoughts too.. wanted to find out if there is a known "pattern" that does this more efficiently
[18:19:43] <Bower^> ah right
[18:22:14] <formers> hi can someone please help me with invalid object initializer error that firebug is giving, I've narrowed it down to using the .data on an element that i have just created. I've created a testcase here: http://jsfiddle.net/MyxmD/1/
[18:22:52] <ajpiano> formers: that's not an array literal or an object literal
[18:22:58] <ajpiano> [2, 1] i suspect you're after
[18:23:24] <formers> ahh right let me just try that
[18:23:28] <ajpiano> { } is an object lieral but what's inside of it isn't valid
[18:23:35] <ajpiano> hence "invalid object initializer"
[18:24:41] <formers> ahh right... yup that works thanks ajpiano
[18:39:59] <Engin> well, that's it.
[18:40:12] <Engin> I just donated a few bucks to JQ. This shit kicks ass
[18:42:38] <ajpiano> thanks Engin :)
[18:47:31] <Funhouse> Hey there, is there a way to know if a key is being pressed?
[18:48:12] <Funhouse> like in gtalk, if you hold the shift key, then press enter, it will not submit your message rather it will do a new line break
[18:48:51] <Kyoorius> cool question : )
[18:49:17] <Kyoorius> im a newbie so will wait fr one of the shifus
[18:49:21] <ajpiano> Funhouse: keyup, keydown, keypress events?
[18:49:40] <Funhouse> ajpiano, yes, but is there a way to know if the key is being pressed, or is currently down?
[18:50:04] <ajpiano> $("#someInput").keydown(function(event) { if (event.shiftKey) { }    });
[18:50:15] <ajpiano> Funhouse, by tracking those events
[18:50:41] <ajpiano> storing some kind of flag when the keydown happens, and then clearing it when keyup..
[19:06:23] <tmayr> any easy way to clear the html within a div except #foo?
[19:15:13] <yogurt_truck> tmayr: i suppose you could do a $("div > :not('#foo')").html('')
[19:15:28] <yogurt_truck> assuming i understood correctly, that is...
[19:15:44] <tmayr> did that exactly :P
[19:16:03] <yogurt_truck> :>
[19:25:01] <annasob> wondering if someone can help me out
[19:25:31] <annasob> i want to apply a css class to multiple divs but i only know the id of their parent div
[19:26:27] <annasob> trying to figure out how to grab a div then all of its children and append a css class basically
[19:27:36] <tbranyen> $('#parentDiv').children().addClass('something') ?
[19:27:55] <grid_> goodnight :)
[19:28:03] <tmayr> tbranyen: that would work
[19:28:11] <tmayr> if not, you would need to iterate over each children i guess
[19:28:18] <annasob> awesome thx…
[19:28:26] <tbranyen> np
[19:28:40] <tbranyen> tmayr: thats what jquery does under the hood
[19:29:01] <tmayr> tbranyen: probably, i wasnt 100% sure :P
[19:29:18] <tbranyen> no i mean it does... i'm not speculating here :)
[19:29:38] <tbranyen> rawr
[19:30:23] <tmayr> :D
[19:30:56] <tmayr> is there any other reliable way to test IE compatibility other than having a VM with each IE version? ._.
[19:31:07] <plov> anyway to simulate a input button when clicked for a div? to make the div actually look like a button when pressed down
[19:34:53] <tmayr> plov: use the pseudo class :active, that will let you skin "pressed" state
[19:35:46] <Kyoorius> tmayr: try ieframe for chrome ... im sorry i had to
[19:35:57] <tmayr> good one :P
[19:36:03] <Kyoorius> :D
[19:36:35] <tmayr> time to do multiple xp installs i guess, ietester is not reliable at all :(
[19:36:54] <Kyoorius> i noticed ietester has this weird caching bug
[19:37:08] <Kyoorius> dont know if anyone else has the same problem
[19:37:32] <Kyoorius> need to reopen a tab in order to clear cache on ietester... even when caching is supposedly disabled
[19:37:38] <tmayr> well, right now i have caching disabled in it, tried ctrl+f5, and js in ie8 tab just wont work
[19:37:40] <tmayr> native IE8 runs it fine
[19:38:58] <Kyoorius> i just reopen tabs each time now
[19:39:07] <Kyoorius> cause i cant trust it to have cache disabled
[19:41:27] <tmayr> you cant trust ie you mean :D
[19:42:08] <Kyoorius> either one
[19:42:42] <tmayr> i wonder if running IE in wrappers in osx works fine...
[19:43:04] <Kyoorius> what are wrappers?
[19:43:43] <tmayr> they're wine instances made .app with apps inside, usually just one
[19:44:28] * fireh forgot about wine
[19:57:25] <Sim026> Hey guys
[19:57:51] <Sim026> please i wanna know how to handle Json data with a callback function in Jquery
[19:58:49] <Sim026> the json data looks like this : {"57410":{"poster":"http:\/\/images.allocine.fr\/medias\/nmedia\/18\/35\/46\/08\/18409136.jpg","title":"","Otitle":"Saw","ProdYear":2004,"realisateur":"James Wan"}
[19:59:03] <Engin> is it actually possible to interfer back/forward buttons ?
[19:59:32] <Engin> the solutions I found apparently relies on # (anchoring) ?
[20:00:22] <airportyh> Engin: yeah, you want something like http://plugins.jquery.com/project/history-js
[20:00:42] <Engin> that's what I'm going to do, yes, history
[20:00:56] <airportyh> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/ is another good one
[20:01:34] <Engin> well, if I'm going to fallback to #hashing anyway
[20:01:53] <Engin> I don't see a reason to use html5 one
[20:02:19] <airportyh> I see. you want to use pushstate?
[20:03:04] <Engin> huh ?
[20:03:22] <Engin> I mean, I'll go with what all browsers support -- which apparently means hashing.
[20:03:34] <airportyh> the html5 pushstate feature, is that what you are refering to
[20:03:37] <Engin> I thought there was a way to just intercept the back/forward clicks.
[20:03:51] <airportyh> yeah, hashing is the cross browser way
[20:04:06] <airportyh> actually, w ie there's some additional complication
[20:04:19] <airportyh> that's why you'll want to use a library
[20:04:19] <tmayr> IE? Complications? Madness!
[20:04:27] <Engin> I see
[20:04:37] <Engin> IE should really be removed
[20:04:45] <Engin> 99% of the time it is the odd one.
[20:04:48] <chjj> removed from existence
[20:05:05] <Engin> and all others more-or-less work consistently with each other
[20:05:35] <Engin> there was a mockup ad for IE; "number one browser to download a better browser"
[20:05:47] <Engin> sums it up :D
[20:05:55] <Engin> though new ones are quite high performance 9-10
[20:06:58] <tmayr> 9-10 are fine, hell, even 8 is fine to me, minor issues
[20:07:34] <Onions> How would I have an input text field which auto-adds commas the the number? I keep getting function is not defined errors when I have a function ls
[20:07:37] <Onions> :s*
[20:08:11] <djQuery> you mean you want to format the # as 1,000,000.090
[20:08:20] <Onions> yep
[20:08:32] <djQuery> dont is my best advice.
[20:08:42] <mcbtay> i have a pretty simple question if anyone has time to help out
[20:08:45] <Onions> >.<
[20:08:49] <djQuery> but you functiohn is not defined error has nothing to do with that
[20:08:53] <Onions> right
[20:08:54] <tmayr> djQuery: why?
[20:09:00] <djQuery> Onions: see ?demo

[20:09:09] <Onions> what?
[20:09:29] <djQuery> is the user in the US, Canada or Europe?
[20:09:29] <Onions> oh
[20:10:10] <tmayr> so you would chose not to format because of differences of formats between countries?

[20:15:27] <paul_irish> great!
[20:15:34] <Onions> doesnt work o.o

[20:22:01] <mcbtay> anyone care to help with a simple issue?
[20:22:27] <mcbtay> http://jsfiddle.net/89AVN/2/, what i want is to duplicate the rows, but only have one button... any insight?
[20:24:40] <Sailias> $('.class').live('click', function(e) { $('.other_class').addClass('new_class') }); does not have any effect.  Even though .hasClass('new_class') is true.  but .click(function() ...  does have an effect

[20:25:22] <mcbtay> djquery: i tried remove and couldn't get it to work
[20:25:48] <mcbtay> airportyh, is there a way to have the button on the last row?
[20:25:57] <BaconJuice_> http://jsfiddle.net/89AVN/4/ ?
[20:26:42] <mcbtay> BaconJuice_, not exactly what i had in mind, airportyh is on the right track
[20:27:26] <BaconJuice_> what exactly do you need changes from his?
[20:27:41] <airportyh> mcbtay: styling can probably take care of it?
[20:27:45] <mcbtay> well i would like the button to be on the last row
[20:28:21] <djQuery> mcbtay: just remove the button from all the other rows.
[20:28:36] <BaconJuice_> mcbtay: which button?
[20:28:43] <BaconJuice_> I see it in last row already
[20:28:45] <airportyh> mcbtay: any reason why? would be simpler this way
[20:29:12] <mcbtay> airportyh, not really, just thought it would look cleaner this way the way my form is laid out
[20:29:20] <mcbtay> and djQuery, is there an easy way to do that
[20:29:32] <paul_irish> hey airportyh :)
[20:29:36] <BaconJuice_> any got any idea why jqm UI style is lost when I make it dynamic?
[20:29:44] <airportyh> paul_irish: hey bro ;)
[20:30:04] <paul_irish> i havent forgotten about coming to atlanta! you'll be the first to know
[20:30:28] <min|dvir|us> I'd like to iterate over a collection of elements like $('a') in such a way where I can stop whenever I want.
[20:30:33] <min|dvir|us> Possible?
[20:30:39] <paul_irish> yes
[20:30:42] <airportyh> paul_irish: would love to have you!
[20:31:12] <Giverny> lol
[20:31:14] <min|dvir|us> paul_irish: Yeah, just saw.
[20:31:27] <min|dvir|us> If anyone's interested, return false in .each()'s callback.
[20:31:48] <georgemalibu> Having issue with Firefox on Windows and Jquery /UI/Accordion. Any one familiar with why Firefox is inadequate
[20:32:26] <Sailias> any idea why .live adds the class to the element but doesn't have an effect on the page, but .click adds the class and it does have the correct effect?
[20:32:32] <Giverny> georgemalibu problem with css?
[20:33:34] <georgemalibu> the css is fine, jquery does not seem to add proper classes to <li> elements for the CSS to pick up
[20:33:45] <Giverny> o.o
[20:34:06] <djQuery> mcbtay: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/89AVN/5/
[20:34:14] <georgemalibu> only on windows Firefox 3.5, on mac it it fine.
[20:35:31] <Giverny> georgemalibu put document.getElementsByClassName
[20:36:06] <airportyh> paul_irish: btw, loved last episode, thanks.
[20:36:10] <Giverny> georgemalibu is the same thing jquery
[20:36:11] <mcbtay> djQuery: thanks man :D
[20:36:26] <novacall> hey guys, anything better & newer for ajax communication in js? is ajax still the best?
[20:36:39] <djQuery> mcbtay: I dont like having ids in stuff I am cloning
[20:37:02] <Charles_Oneka> hi guys...i am getting pwned by jquery.
[20:37:06] <Giverny> novacall ajax and node.js
[20:37:30] <georgemalibu> Giverny is for the testing purposes, or is that a permanent solution? I am using the http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[20:37:48] <novacall> Giverny: Thanks bud...
[20:37:58] <novacall> excellent answer, trying it now
[20:38:12] <djQuery> mcbtay: because ids are unique
[20:38:27] <airportyh> novacall: websockets is pretty cool, also newer than ajax ;)
[20:38:28] <mcbtay> djQuery: gotcha :D
[20:38:42] <novacall> airportyh: thanks, ill check that out too ;)
[20:38:52] <Giverny> georgemalibu whatever
[20:39:03] <Charles_Oneka> http://pastebin.com/2fFpjTfF
[20:39:10] <novacall> airportyh: As long as there not like winsock sockets =P
[20:39:32] <Giverny> georgemalibu JQuery is a framework, JavaScript is a language
[20:39:34] <Charles_Oneka> I am trying to get the application to run a function which hooks and creates a clickable link with color box, however i have tried this with many other jquery plugins and wordpress.
[20:39:53] <Charles_Oneka> it just won't let me add that accessible option for the links.
[20:40:59] <Giverny> Charles_Oneka how you doing these links?
[20:42:05] <Charles_Oneka> the links are being loaded from a different php file and then once they are created and loaded, i had to change them, after they were changed i needed to add the colorbox() function to them.
[20:42:26] <Charles_Oneka> seems i can't access the links because i am using load()... and i really don't know any other way to do it.
[20:42:41] <novacall> airportyh: are you using google-chrome + websockets?
[20:42:42] <djQuery> Charles_Oneka: then you should change you nick to Stef Murky
[20:42:55] <Charles_Oneka> lol why?
[20:43:23] <Charles_Oneka> don't hate man, been at the keyboard bashing my head for about a 2 days now.
[20:43:35] <djQuery> Charles_Oneka: ever read userfriendly.org?
[20:44:00] * djQuery got tired of replacing keyboards so just bang on desk now
[20:44:05] <Charles_Oneka> i know...but the means to this whole....userfriendly thing, was the clients idea...they wanted it exactly this way.
[20:44:11] <Giverny> Charles_Oneka you're getting it right with Ajax and jQuery? But as they are being displayed?
[20:44:15] <Onions> How would you remove every , from a variable (not an array)
[20:44:21] <Charles_Oneka> ahahah djQuery.
[20:44:33] <novacall> Ok, is there anything newer then ajax  & node.js and websockets, which provides easier communication through JS without a server-side install?
[20:44:54] <Charles_Oneka> yes, that is what i am trying to do, do I need to make a new function to act after they are displayed?
[20:45:30] <djQuery> Charles_Oneka: do you have the ability to return a json object instead of some html that has to be parsed?
[20:45:39] <closedbracket> what's a good pluggin for customizing form elements like checkboxes and radio buttons?
[20:45:52] <Charles_Oneka> I did that...it didn't respond too well..how do i allow it to wait for it to do what it neads to then convert the function to the link. Not with this becuase data is being loaded from external site.
[20:46:19] <Charles_Oneka> and its html...basicallly client wanted me to strip it off his online store so he could put it in another site.
[20:46:36] <djQuery> ?sop@charles_oneka
[20:46:37] <bot-t> charles_oneka, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[20:47:01] <djQuery> ?jsonp

[20:47:04] <Giverny> lol
[20:47:07] <Charles_Oneka> yes, that is why I used a proxy.php
[20:47:46] <Giverny> Charles_oneka is greatly missed
[20:48:02] <Charles_Oneka> lol ok, stop the hate.
[20:50:43] <Giverny> Charles_Oneka php is a language server-side is a backend.. JavaScript is a client-side and frontend... You just need use ajax to join the two languages
[20:50:48] <BaconJuice_> how do I .hide() and .show() with same function?
[20:50:52] <georgemalibu> Giverny, can i just do a degradation for Firefox? and use static content instead of the accordion
[20:51:00] <BaconJuice_> new to jquery =/
[20:51:22] <Charles_Oneka> well let me give it a shot
[20:51:48] <Giverny> Chainfire i agreed
[20:53:34] <Giverny> BaconJuice .hide() and .show() are wraps
[20:54:26] <Giverny> BaconJuice you can use the same selector
[20:54:52] <Charles_Oneka> ok so here is the issue.
[20:54:53] <djQuery> BaconJuice: ?.toggle?
[20:54:58] <Charles_Oneka> the site doesn't return json data...
[20:55:16] <Giverny> $("BaconJuice").hide().show(); ok BaconJuice ?
[20:55:35] <chjj> Giverny: who said javascript is only frontend? :)
[20:55:45] <Giverny> chjj not
[20:55:56] <Giverny> chjj not only
[20:56:10] <djQuery> chjj: because this is #jquery not #node.js
[20:56:41] <chjj> i know, for all practicality its frontend, i just like to point it out ;)
[20:56:57] <chjj> since i use it every day on the backend
[20:57:06] <Charles_Oneka> wow, my life sucks. I don't have access to the server i am pulling data from, that is why i wrote it that way.
[20:57:43] <Giverny> chjj not like the javascript backend yet
[20:58:21] <Giverny> chjj there are better languages for this
[20:58:50] <chjj> ?
[20:59:21] <Giverny> to backend
[20:59:22] <georgemalibu> Giverny forgive my ignorance, put am I putting this in function initalize, document.getElementsByClassName()
[20:59:29] <Charles_Oneka> its a random envato site that the client wanted data displayed on the site with.
[20:59:47] <chjj> Giverny: i dont understand what youre saying
[21:00:06] <djQuery> Giverny: the best programing language is the one that you allready know how to work around the bugs
[21:00:38] <Charles_Oneka> So is there a way to access that data other than json?
[21:00:55] <Giverny> djQuery or less buggy and a better standard
[21:01:44] <Giverny> Charles_Oneka yes
[21:02:13] <Charles_Oneka> did u see my pastie?
[21:04:08] <Charles_Oneka> ...can u help, i have seriously been trying to figure it out for days.
[21:04:29] <Charles_Oneka> google is a bit retarded now, it doesn't really give u the info u want with all that filtering that is going on.
[21:04:38] <Giverny> Charles_Oneka my english isn`t excellent
[21:04:57] <Charles_Oneka> lol, nor is mine...
[21:05:38] <georgemalibu> Giverny, [00:03:15.257] document.getElementById('accordion'); I used this function, but I cannot test it on the Firefox 3.5 on windows because the console does not work
[21:06:35] <BaconJuice_> how do I uncheck a radio button thru jquery if selected?
[21:06:39] <chjj> markdown syntax was so horribly designed =/
[21:07:39] <Giverny> georgemalibu you're doing wrong
[21:07:53] <georgemalibu> what am I doing wrong sir?
[21:08:27] <Giverny> georgemalibu you have to get the element or the id or class with the javascript function that is
[21:09:08] <Giverny> georgemalibu you can create a variable with this function there and then work with it more easily
[21:09:18] <Charles_Oneka> well thanks everyone.
[21:09:43] <Giverny> var get = getElementById('idofelement');
[21:09:55] <georgemalibu> but Jquery Accordion is already getting that for me, it works on all the browsers I have tested(IE, Chrome, Opera, Safari) but not Windows Firefox 3.5.
[21:10:11] <Giverny> this is the same as $('id').
[21:10:25] <Giverny> var get = $('id');
[21:11:03] <georgemalibu> Giverny, this is my function call on document load: $('#accordion').accordion({ autoHeight: false, header: 'h3'});
[21:11:13] <Giverny> georgemalibu it does not work you can use JQuery javascript
[21:12:04] <Giverny> georgemalibu you can use your own javascript jquery if it is not working I spoke
[21:12:48] <georgemalibu> so, get.accordion();
[21:13:34] <Giverny> lol
[21:14:04] <Giverny> georgemalibu you can use your own javascript if your Jquery isn´t working man
[21:14:38] <Giverny> georgemalibu understand that?
[21:14:44] <georgemalibu> but how can I reproduce the accordion effect already in the jquery framework, I cannot write that from scratch?
[21:15:24] <Giverny> georgemalibu you can
[21:15:46] <Giverny> georgemalibu accordion is a plugin in JQuery
[21:15:54] <georgemalibu> ok
[21:16:09] <georgemalibu> can you give me a few more pointers, why is that good for me?
[21:17:00] <Giverny> georgemalibu is good for your learning in Jquery
[21:17:18] <Giverny> georgemalibu but you can use plugin too
[21:17:50] <Giverny> georgemalibu the choice is your
[21:18:08] <georgemalibu> thanks man
[21:19:06] <madprops> hi
[21:19:48] <madprops> what can i use to close the current tab?
[21:20:03] <madprops> i tried window.close() but it is only working on popups of the first instance
[21:20:13] <madprops> how can I close an instance that is not a popup?
[21:22:46] <djQuery> madprops: you cant security issue with the browser.
[21:22:57] <djQuery> you could always crash the browser to close it
[21:23:55] <madprops> djQuery, i don't mean the last tab in the browser, but the first instance opened of a site
[21:24:09] <madprops> why would it be a security issue?
[21:27:27] <Charles_Oneka> http://pastebin.com/tvqTzr9k can someone please help me figure out how to handle this situation with loaded content? http://pastebin.com/tvqTzr9k
[21:33:30] <dhome> hey anyone here know how to detect when a textarea has been resized? like ... 	$('textarea').resize(function() {
[21:33:31] <dhome>      alert('something happened');
[21:33:31] <dhome>     });
[21:33:44] <dhome> (that doesnt work)
[21:33:59] <vol7ron> dhome
[21:34:19] <dhome> vol7ron
[21:34:58] <vol7ron> oh hey
[21:35:11] <dhome> hi there
[21:35:24] <vol7ron> what are you trying to do?
[21:36:15] <dhome> the latest versions of chrome and FF have added the little handlebar when you expand a textarea.. i want to detect that
[21:36:42] <vol7ron> do you have an example?
[21:36:45] <dhome> a little handlebar for* you to expand a textarea
[21:36:59] <dhome> um... maybe. hold on.
[21:37:22] <dhome> im just wondering if FF throws an event when that thing gets resized.
[21:39:36] <vol7ron> don't worry about it, i tried in fiddle and you're right
[21:40:25] <dhome> you understand what im trying to do?
[21:40:51] <vol7ron> yeah
[21:41:46] <dhome> http://hexial.com/jqirc.html
[21:41:56] <vol7ron> i'm not sure you'll be able to
[21:42:07] <dhome> i want to resize the iframes whenever the textarea gets bigger
[21:42:15] <vol7ron> you might be able to custom build one using mousedown/mouseup
[21:42:25] <dhome> ugh.
[21:42:55] <vol7ron> i'm going to try that
[21:43:12] <dhome> yeah, im afraid you're right.. i dont think there's a way to do it without a bit of a workaround
[21:48:51] <Spadeski> Hello everyone
[21:48:58] <vol7ron> dhome: http://jsfiddle.net/vol7ron/Z7HDn/
[21:49:21] <vol7ron> it's not that big of one
[21:49:45] <mcbtay> djQuery, you still here by chance?
[21:49:51] <Spadeski> Does anyone know anything about jquery audio or flash I wanna make a simple audio player
[21:51:34] <Giverny> voooooooooooooooilare
[21:51:36] <Giverny> oooooo
[21:53:24] <vol7ron> dhome: never mind that won't work
[21:53:36] <mcbtay> http://jsfiddle.net/89AVN/8/, how could i get it to delete the label each time?
[21:53:42] <mcbtay> except on the first row
[21:55:38] <mcbtay> i figured it out :)
[21:57:06] <dhome> vol7ron... seems to work for me...?
[21:57:17] <vol7ron> not in chrome though
[21:57:21] <dhome> ah
[21:57:30] <vol7ron> you can't capture the mousedown
[21:57:45] <vol7ron> and i didn't put any check for undefineds… just differences
[21:57:49] <dhome> seems to here, though im in chrome 14 i believe
[21:58:07] <vol7ron> that's because it's comparing the captured value to an undefined
[21:58:25] <vol7ron> if you just click the box, but don't move, it shouldn't have anything appear
[21:58:31] <dhome> i was mainly using this internally.. not working in chrome is okay
[22:04:23] <djQuery> mcbtay: nopers
[22:04:59] <madprops> is there a plugin that retrieve the information of the operating system running the browser?
[22:05:05] <madprops> retrieves*
[22:05:40] <djQuery> madprops http://www.javascripter.net/faq/operatin.htm
[22:07:06] <madprops> djQuery, i mean the information of that system like cpu, ram, uptime etc
[22:19:11] <djQuery> madprops: not without a browser plugin
[22:37:35] <amh345> im working on a modal window.  i've got it triggering and all that jazz.  but what i'm trying to figure out is how to pass an ID to the modal.   the link is going to be an li.  is there a way for me to make the id of that LI pass to the modal?
[22:45:53] <madprops> how can i check if an image belongs to a certain div?
[22:49:34] <buddyq> could someone help me see what is not working? A little background. I'm converting zAccordion into a template for my gallery in a Joomla Component.
[22:49:47] <buddyq> http://deployed.tangerinefiles.com/gallery
[22:50:08] <buddyq> if you look at this in firebug, you'll see I'm getting: AG_jQuery("#zaccordion_046").zAccordion is not a function
[22:51:04] <buddyq> I know AG_jQuery call works because if I put AG_jQuery(function() { alert("Something"); } , it works.
[22:51:33] <buddyq> so then it must be .zAccordion script not loading? However the script is loaded on the page. Is there something I am missing?
[22:56:37] <buddyq> anyone?
[23:06:08] <DerNalia> I have a little animation issue: http://pastie.org/2369307 How do I get it so that I hide the divs, change their contents THEN show them again? In my paste, I have the hide before the content changing code, and the show after. But as it's sliding out, I can see the text on the divs change before the slide out is complete. =\ Do I have my timeouts in the wrong place? how do I fix this?
[23:09:03] <austen> Ugh... Trying to use jquery-ui sliders... Don't know wtf I'm doing wrong, but I can't get the damn things to display...
[23:10:14] <austen> I can see the injected code when I inspect the elements, I can adjust the CSS values to outline them with borders and such, but otherwise all I see is blankness...
[23:16:24] <madprops> how can i check if an image belongs to a certain div?
[23:16:58] <madprops> but i can do something life if $(this) in $('#somediv') ?
[23:23:32] <coldhead> austen: are you including the jQuery UI CSS?
[23:23:43] <Giverny> madprops you can try get $('img') if not exist...
[23:24:11] <coldhead> madprops: if (($this).parents('#somediv').length > 0)
[23:24:29] <austen> Yes
[23:27:51] <coldhead> austen: if you check with firebug or similar all the way up the inheritance tree you might see something to do with an .accessibility class or something which is biting you
[23:28:10] <coldhead> i can't remember exactly what it is but i remember it hurting people a few times in the past
[23:29:18] <austen> Uh... Using chrome... hold on, let me check. I looked but didn't see anything blaring...
[23:32:22] <buddyq> hey guys... can you help me figure out what is wrong with my page? Here? Firebug says zAccordion is not a function... but it's loaded.
[23:32:30] <buddyq> http://deployed.tangerinefiles.com/gallery
[23:32:51] <butterfly> buddyq,  and what is wrong?
[23:33:17] <buddyq> well, I cant figure out why it says its not a function. Jquery seems to be loaded and so is the plugin.
[23:33:27] <buddyq> as far as I can tell
[23:36:37] <insign> how to join {a:'string'} and {b : 'string'} in a unique object?
[23:37:25] <coldhead> insign: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[23:38:55] <coldhead> insign: http://jsfiddle.net/baKzr/
[23:39:53] <insign> coldhead, thanks
[23:43:46] <coldhead> buddyq: perhaps all this AG_jQuery business is upsetting it
[23:44:26] <buddyq> coldhead: I dont think so. AG_jQuery works.... watch I'll put a trigger an alert in there.
[23:44:37] <coldhead> no i believe you
[23:44:49] <coldhead> but how is the plugin going to know to use AG_jQuery?
[23:45:12] <buddyq> If you reload, you'll see the alert now.
[23:45:42] <coldhead> that plugin is adding a method to jQUery
[23:45:46] <buddyq> well, Hmm.... you know how you can redefine the $ to anything you want? That is what is going on.
[23:46:01] <coldhead> but alert(jQuery === AG_jQUery) // false
[23:46:44] <buddyq> var AG_jQuery = $.noConflict(true);
[23:46:44] <coldhead> so maybe you wanna change jQuery to AG_jQuery in the accordion's file
[23:47:05] <coldhead> yes i understand
[23:47:15] <buddyq> ah.... so the plugin is using jQuery?
[23:47:23] <coldhead> yes
[23:47:31] <coldhead> most things will use jQuery
[23:47:42] <coldhead> noConflict leaves your $ alone
[23:47:51] <coldhead> buuut jQuery still expects to be accessible as jQuery
[23:48:12] <coldhead> and your jQuery variable seems to be something... else
[23:48:35] <madprops> thanks coldhead, Giverny
[23:49:21] <austen> Ok... that was bizarre... jquery-slider() will *ONLY WORK* if the element you're adding sliding to is visible... If you have something "off screen" and try to apply .slider() it won't insert it.
[23:49:36] <coldhead> ew austen
[23:49:39] <coldhead> well debugged
[23:49:48] <austen> My menus are animated to slide in...
[23:49:57] <austen> That is such strange behavior!
[23:50:39] <austen> I wonder why it happens that way... I'll have to download the un-minimized source and look at it.
[23:51:08] <coldhead> this is the kind of thing that makes me back away from jQuery UI
[23:51:35] <buddyq> coldhead:http://deployed.tangerinefiles.com/plugins/content/AdmirorGallery/AG_jQuery.js
[23:51:40] <coldhead> buddyq: it looks like something is setting your jQuery varialbe to be undefined
[23:51:50] <buddyq> coldhead: what about that file?
[23:51:55] <coldhead> which i would expect would break most plugins
[23:52:00] <austen> Yeah, while I was trying to figure that out I was thinking, "I could probably just write my own damn slider for how long this is taking..."
[23:52:10] <buddyq> looks like this is jquery wrapped.
[23:52:37] <coldhead> that's a very old school version of jQuery. buddyq
[23:52:59] <buddyq> Yea. I was thinking of getting the new version and keeping the wrapper.
[23:55:11] <coldhead> i would try including the latest jQuery from a CDN
[23:55:19] <coldhead> and don't bother with the wrapper
[23:55:37] <coldhead> you can still call noConflic() to free up $ for mootools to use
[23:55:51] <coldhead> but you should be able to use jQuery('wheaver')
[23:55:55] <coldhead> whenever you need it
[23:56:04] <coldhead> it's less typing than AG_jQuery
[23:56:11] <coldhead> and should save the confusion
[23:56:46] <coldhead> OR you could do the noConflict bit in a script just before you load the mootools stuff
[23:56:52] <coldhead> but after you load the other jQ plugins
[23:57:01] <coldhead> so they can still all access jQuery as needed
[23:59:21] <Brodingo> who
[23:59:29] <Brodingo> whoops
[23:59:57] <Brodingo> sup coldhead
