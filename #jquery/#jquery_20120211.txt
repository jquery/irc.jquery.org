[00:00:17] <ngharo> theBrettman: and it doesnt appear to work without calling it on a form anyhow
[00:00:25] <theBrettman> k
[00:00:54] <theBrettman> can a form have a title?
[00:01:28] <ngharo> title?
[00:01:45] <theBrettman> I don't have to put the url if I used action, right? and do I have to prevent defualt cuz doesn't it trigger a submit()?
[00:01:55] <theBrettman> yes, need the title for the dialog
[00:02:09] <theBrettman> whatever I use for title will go on the title bar
[00:02:27] <ngharo> <div id="dialog-foo" title="bleh"><form> ... </form></div>
[00:02:27] <theBrettman> I could just put the form inside the div but maybe I could just turn the div into the form?
[00:03:03] <theBrettman> well the form needs an id for it, right? cuz there will be multiple dialogs with forms... nvm, I can just use the div id with form
[00:03:20] <ngharo> you got choices heh
[00:03:57] <theBrettman> yeah, I was about to leave it as is and use .each() then realized it's too much work
[00:15:54] <pif> hi, is tooltip support coming in jquery-ui?
[00:34:01] <fotoflo> hi all. I have an $.each iterating over a list and calling an $.ajax on each item.  How can I do something when the $.each is done?  I am thinking that I will have to get the length of the list and then trigger a custom event when that list is done iterating and then catch the event.   Is there a better way?
[00:37:39] <fotoflo> by catch i mean bind to
[00:38:24] <fotoflo> anyone here?
[00:46:48] <gigafied> I've put hundreds of hours into this, so I am going to shamelessly self promote
[00:46:50] <gigafied> https://github.com/gigafied/minion
[00:47:59] <deitarion> What's the equivalent to $("foo > bar > baz") when "foo" is a jQuery object rather than a selector? (Specifically, ui.panel as provided by the jQuery UI Tabs AJAX load event)
[00:48:20] <gigafied> foo.find("bar > baz");
[00:48:42] <deitarion> gigafied: That's what I'd normally use, but I need "foo > bar > baz", not "foo bar > baz".
[00:49:01] <gigafied> foo.children("bar > baz");
[00:49:20] <ruby_on_tails> after the first drag(using ui draggable) the links inside the dragged item are not triggering click events, why ?
[00:49:32] <deitarion> Ahh. I wasn't sure if children took full, complex selectors and, in retrospect, I really should've RTFM'd.
[00:50:12] <gigafied> haha no worries, but even if it didn't you could do foo.children("bar").children("bad") :)
[00:50:21] <gigafied> baz*
[00:55:36] <deitarion> gigafied: True. Also, while I'm here, I should probably ask what, exactly, $("foo bar baz", node) does. My understanding of what I'd read was that it should be roughly equivalent to $(node).find("foo bar baz") but that seems to not be true.
[01:11:36] <Nasga> Hello, i search a plugin to use websocket (via websocket / flash / java). Socket.io looks nice but require a node js… do you have idea about ?
[01:16:05] <kevinmencos> hi guy

[01:35:59] <jasonevers> i have been here a few times.
[02:23:30] <aqeel> $("#mmc").width($(document).width()/2).height($(document).height()/2);................is this valid argument...
[02:25:45] <aqeel> anyone???
[02:26:01] <aqeel> $("#mmc").width($(document).width()/2).height($(document).height()/2);................is this valid argument...
[02:30:06] <ravenzz> aqeel you can center elements with css btw
[02:31:06] <aqeel> this is not center but dynamic for width on different sscreen....
[02:31:33] <aqeel> it will tkae exactly what is needed if screen is big or small
[02:31:51] <aqeel> by the way height is for testing only...
[02:32:07] <aqeel> because the content will chage though....
[02:32:19] <p2paul> window.innerWidth   and   left 50%   and   margin-left -(half div width)?
[02:33:05] <ravenzz> if the element has a width , even if it is in percentage, you can center it with margin:0 auto;
[02:33:07] <ravenzz> 0 or whatever
[02:33:31] <aqeel> agree but width is x....gets it from window.width()......
[02:33:50] <aqeel> change of screen siue......width is not static...
[02:34:02] <ravenzz> is it auto?
[02:34:12] <aqeel> yes and dynamic too
[02:34:15] <ravenzz> x = width:auto?
[02:34:30] <aqeel> auto not as in css but automatically taken by javascript
[02:34:56] <ravenzz> do you have a link I can see?
[02:35:02] <aqeel> sure....
[02:35:11] <aqeel> designing the interface ....
[02:35:16] <aqeel> let me load it for u
[02:39:00] <aqeel> file:///C:/Users/AQEEL/Desktop/jailbreak/public_html/index.html
[02:39:05] <aqeel> click detail
[02:39:10] <aqeel> sorry
[02:39:19] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[02:39:30] <aqeel> link from local....should be site
[02:40:08] <aqeel> it is the test test test window i am making....
[02:40:28] <fotoflo> hi all. I have an $.each iterating over a list and calling an $.ajax on each item.  How can I do something when the $.each is done?  I am thinking that I will have to get the length of the list and then trigger a custom event when that list is done iterating and then $.bind the event.  Is there a better way?
[02:41:22] <aqeel> to close the window click the spade icon
[02:43:40] <aqeel> ravenzz did u saw it??
[02:45:43] <dabear_> fotoflo: when the .each is done, or when the ajax requests are done?
[02:46:42] <fotoflo> the each calls the ajax
[02:47:02] <fotoflo> dabear_: so i need a callback at the end of the each
[02:47:17] <fotoflo> or rather… at the success of the last ajax
[02:47:25] <fotoflo> but not the previous ones
[02:47:31] <dabear_> ok
[02:47:35] <dabear_> that's easy
[02:48:40] <fotoflo> dabear_: …. whats the procedure?
[02:48:43] <dabear_> var ajaxReqs = []; $.each(..., function(){  ajaxReqs.push( $.ajax(...) ) } );
[02:49:31] <dabear_> after the each, do an var lastRequest = ajaxReqs[ajaxReqs.length-1]
[02:50:24] <fotoflo> ok so i have a list of functions, and i pull the last item off the list
[02:50:28] <dabear_> lastRequest.then(function(){ /* success*/}, function(){ /* failure */}  )
[02:50:40] <fotoflo> .then?
[02:50:45] <fotoflo> (googling)
[02:50:52] <dabear_> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[02:51:04] <dabear_> $.ajax returns a deferred
[02:51:08] <fotoflo> thanks!
[02:52:58] <fotoflo> I am still getting my head around pushing the whole $.ajax into a list
[02:53:54] <dabear_> The jqXHR objects returned by $.ajax() as of jQuery 1.5 implement the Promise interface, giving them all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see Deferred object for more information)
[02:54:00] <fotoflo> and also reading about dfereed
[02:54:41] <fotoflo> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/ <-- start reading here?
[02:55:00] <fotoflo> Including  "what's a promise interface?"
[02:55:02] <ravenz> aqeel I am back, sorry
[02:55:38] <aqeel> did u saw it...
[02:55:59] <ravenz> yep
[02:56:09] <ravenz> what is the element in question?
[02:56:18] <aqeel> hey my css is working locally but when uploaded it is not showing on site...
[02:56:48] <aqeel> the test test test window has a width ahnd height dynamically
[02:57:07] <aqeel> $("#mmc").width($(document).width()/2).height($(document).height()/2);................is this valid argument...
[02:57:15] <fotoflo> Dabear: The wife is ready so I'm off to a dinner party, can't do much reading now… THanks for your help, it looks like it will work.
[02:57:56] <ravenz> aqeel where is this test test test window ?
[02:58:16] <aqeel> after u click detail...link on left side
[02:58:37] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[02:58:38] <ravenz> ok
[02:58:52] <ravenz> it is basically a 3 columns layout
[02:59:01] <ravenz> you can do that with css
[03:00:27] <intellilogic> Ok, there is a Click function in someone else's library, I want to activate it without changing the library or creating duplicate code, how can I do this?  Something like Foo.click()?
[03:00:48] <aqeel> oh...no no......that is a window that will appear when hover over mm....main menu.....and i want that to be 2 colums.....i just want to assign it the width and height dynamically....can u tell me your approach
[03:03:12] <aqeel> u can escape the library ...like using in jquery noconflict and make use of that library....inteelilogic
[03:04:04] <aqeel> so ravenz ....how is it....
[03:08:57] <aqeel> ok got it working ...all files did not got uploaded......jailbreak.webege.com
[03:13:14] <ravenz> aqeel http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail
[03:17:06] <aqeel> i did use that method for my index page
[03:17:24] <aqeel> $("#mmc").width($(document).width()/2).height($(document).height()/2);.............ok now is this valid or not....
[03:18:37] <hurry> someone uses Jeditable ?
[03:19:05] <jasonevers> they don't need tables.
[03:21:18] <aqeel> why are the content between // in javascript green and not regular clor coding?
[03:24:44] <aqeel> it shows though is is regexp...though it is not
[03:30:09] <intellilogic> aqeel: Esacpe it?  I just want to call it and leverage it, but it's tied to a click, I don't intend to do it often, but it seams the best way.
[03:31:26] <aqeel> what library this click is in
[03:31:37] <intellilogic> I want to call this:  $(document).on('click', "table[data-aj_app='TblOrderBy'] th span", function(event){  can I add a function name w/o breaking it and just do that?  (I think that would break the $(this)s in there.
[03:31:40] <aqeel> cant u use that is whith jquery
[03:32:33] <intellilogic> I can't just send the browser a click on something?
[03:32:47] <Kambfhase> $(document).on('click', "table[data-aj_app='TblOrderBy'] th span", functionName)
[03:33:29] <intellilogic> $('#foo').trigger('click'); <-  This will do what I want, won't it?
[03:33:36] <Kambfhase> ?TIAS
[03:33:37] <bot-t> Try It And See
[03:36:36] <hurry> someone uses Jeditable ?
[03:40:25] <jasonevers> I don't but I can't speak for the Jedi's.
[03:41:17] <jasonevers> Oh man. Dead horse much?
[03:42:18] <intellilogic> $('table[data-aj_app="TblOrderBy"] th[data-aj*="\"Column\":\"item_name\""] span[data-aj*="\"Obj\":\"OrderBy_asc\""]').trigger('click');  <- AWESOME!
[03:43:17] <KyleSmith> Hi, can someone give me advice on why this happens: I've made my image fade in using jquery. Sometimes the image don't fade but load little by little but sometimes it works.
[03:43:43] <aqeel> well depends on cache
[03:43:56] <aqeel> load images then aply code
[03:44:20] <intellilogic> "don't fade" -> doesn't fade    SOLVED!  Next.
[03:44:30] <intellilogic> ;)~
[03:51:33] <brice___> hello, anyone know a plugin to display an image waiting until the whole page (image, script, etc.) is not loaded? I can not do
[04:15:44] <FrameFever> I have a array of strings, when I use $.each(myArray, function(){... this is an array of chars
[04:15:55] <FrameFever> whats wrong?
[04:16:25] <Kambfhase> ?p @ FrameFever
[04:16:25] <bot-t> FrameFever, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:16:30] <Kambfhase> sounds weird
[04:21:07] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: http://jsbin.com/ocotec/edit#javascript,html,live
[04:21:14] <axscode> hi guys, i wanted to ask if someone can poin me to a URL of tuts for toggle button that adds remove an innerHTML or overwrites an innerHML of a div... thanks a lot..
[04:21:17] <FrameFever> do you see something?
[04:21:39] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: http://jsbin.com/ocotec/2
[04:22:54] <dabear_> FrameFever: use jsfiddle
[04:22:59] <dabear_> ?jsfiddle
[04:23:00] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[04:23:03] <dabear_> easier to debug
[04:23:39] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: http://jsbin.com/ocotec/2/edit
[04:23:45] <Kambfhase> lookin
[04:24:28] <Kambfhase> ah i see the problem.
[04:24:36] <Kambfhase> let me just rewrite the code.
[04:25:21] <Kambfhase> this works: http://jsbin.com/ocotec/3/edit
[04:26:08] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: so there is no chance to use "this"?
[04:26:50] <Kambfhase> you can use `this` but that makes the string become a String Object, which then for some reason fails to do its job.
[04:27:19] <Kambfhase> you can convert back into a basic string by myString+"".
[04:28:39] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: ahh interesting
[04:29:02] <FrameFever> converting chars to string I have to use + ""
[04:29:07] <FrameFever> is this the prefered method?
[04:29:08] <Kambfhase> nope.
[04:29:20] <FrameFever> or is there some toString(value)
[04:29:34] <Kambfhase> you need to +"" to convert a String object into a string. sounds crazy, but yeah.
[04:31:00] <Kambfhase> its like c_string in C++
[04:33:21] <Kambfhase> this might actually be a WTFJS.
[04:34:18] <NodeX> toString() ???
[04:34:43] <dabear_> ?mdc tostring @ NodeX
[04:34:47] <bot-t> NodeX, Function toString - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a string representing the source code of the function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString
[04:39:53] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: when I set a css property with a function
[04:40:17] <FrameFever> .css("width", function(index, value){...
[04:40:23] <FrameFever> what is index in this case?
[04:41:35] <NodeX> the object which it was set on
[04:41:50] <NodeX> this in chains is allwyas the LAST object preceeding the call
[04:43:44] <NodeX> for example $("#foo").css('blah',function(index .. this ==div#foo
[04:46:54] <axscode> hi guys, i wanted to ask if someone can poin me to a URL of tuts for toggle button that adds remove an innerHTML or overwrites an innerHML of a div... thanks a lot..
[04:48:38] <aqeel> $("#mm").hover(mmcshow,mmchide).click(mmcdisplay);
[04:48:43] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: are you there?
[04:48:44] <devOlsen_> there has got to be a better way to use the typeof operator on more than one variable in a scenario like this (typeof x != 'undefined' && typeof y != 'undefined')? : ;  , right?
[04:48:49] <aqeel> ok challenge...
[04:49:27] <aqeel> how to display item when mouseout and it is after click
[04:49:37] <aqeel> hover works fine
[04:49:57] <aqeel> but then click ....mouseout is trigered...
[04:50:19] <aqeel> after click it should unbind mouseout...
[04:50:35] <ryrych> hi
[04:50:54] <NodeX> axscode : http://pastebin.com/yAzZTNEa
[04:51:08] <axscode> thank you nodex, checking
[04:51:27] <ryrych> in a custom queue I can run the next function in the queue running, e.g next(), but how can I run the next function in the queue with other parameters?
[04:52:25] <aqeel> how to remove mouseout after click
[04:52:56] <aqeel> where hover and click are together...
[04:54:27] <NodeX> unbind ?
[04:54:30] <NodeX> lol
[04:55:13] <lar_zzz> aqeel: with $(this).off('mouseout');
[04:55:29] <aqeel> thanks...
[04:56:08] <NodeX> off is 1.7 jquery
[04:57:51] <aqeel> sorry not working
[04:58:05] <aqeel> using 1.7.1
[04:58:13] <Kambfhase> FrameFever: im back.
[04:58:23] <dabear_> devOlsen_: no, that's the way to do it, but there is rarely any need to check if a variable exists in js
[04:58:54] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: for good?
[04:59:00] <Kambfhase> ro real.
[04:59:04] <Kambfhase> *for
[04:59:04] <devOlsen_> hmm this seems to be working as well (typeof success && typeof error != 'undefined')?
[04:59:12] <devOlsen_> little better.
[04:59:20] <dabear_> nope
[04:59:34] <dabear_> typeof will always return a truthy value
[05:00:08] <dabear_> a string
[05:00:45] <lar_zzz> aqeel: can you put your code on jsfiddle.net?
[05:00:51] <aqeel> ok
[05:01:01] <Kambfhase> whatbwas you question again?
[05:01:40] <axscode> how to disable highlighting on certain all divs with  name or id = "nohighlights"
[05:01:55] <dabear_> highlight?
[05:02:07] <devOlsen_> bah your correct dabear_. Working now that it is reverted back to the long hand.
[05:02:19] <ryrych> can I run ‘next’ function in a queue with additional parameters preserving the chain?
[05:02:19] <devOlsen_> Using this to check for incomming query messages in the uri.
[05:02:34] <ryrych> err queue
[05:03:06] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: when I set a css property with a function
[05:03:06] <FrameFever> .css("width", function(index, value){...
[05:03:06] <FrameFever> what is index in this case?
[05:03:13] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/uUH6K/
[05:03:41] <Kambfhase> well $("selector") might be more than one element.
[05:04:00] <Kambfhase> so $() returns a jQuery array. and index is the index of the element in that array.
[05:05:20] <lar_zzz> aqeel: .off('mouseout', mmcshow)
[05:05:52] <lar_zzz> aqeel: .off('mouseout') should do it too
[05:05:53] <aqeel> thanks...
[05:07:02] <FrameFever> Kambfhase: so the index of the width in the css selector?
[05:07:55] <aqeel> sorry none working
[05:08:18] <aqeel> after clicking it seems mouseout is still in cache...
[05:08:23] <Kambfhase> err no. $('p') << if you have multiple <p> on the page you can acces them via $("p")[0], $("p")[1], ... the number is the index.
[05:09:02] <lar_zzz> aqeel: sorry, the docs said that hover binds mouseleave (and not mouseout) to the element
[05:09:06] <lar_zzz> aqeel: .off('mouseleave', mmchide);
[05:09:17] <mchalk> i installed a lightbox script on my website which makes an ajax request when the user clicks on an image. however, if the user clicks on the image before the page has stopped loading, instead of loading the page in the lightbox it just loads it in a new window (i guess the script hasn't loaded at that point). how can i overcome this?
[05:09:23] <aqeel> ok
[05:12:07] <aqeel> well seems hove not working with off....individually off works
[05:12:13] <aqeel> hover*
[05:13:02] <aqeel> i have to like do this ....mouseenter,mouseleave,click......individually

[06:09:29] <FrameFever> cssProperty is a var
[06:09:49] <aqeel> click mm should show the screen till one of test is clicked

[06:09:58] <NodeX> so that's a yes
[06:10:26] <NodeX> what is mm ?
[06:10:28] <NodeX> lol
[06:10:35] <FrameFever> NodeX?
[06:10:49] <FrameFever> so its not possible...?
[06:10:51] <NodeX> FrameFever ?
[06:10:55] <aqeel> in my site u did not check?
[06:11:00] <NodeX> [14:09:44] <NodeX> FrameFever : JS would be useless unless you could lol

[06:11:33] <NodeX> aqeel, Please explain without your website what you are trying to do because I am really confused
[06:13:33] <aqeel> it is a p tag which has a hover property to show and hide the window....but it must have the click to show the window thus visitor can click the links otherwise it simply hides/....
[06:14:46] <FrameFever> NodeX: it dont work
[06:14:49] <FrameFever> http://jsfiddle.net/kLaHr/
[06:15:38] <NodeX> so on hover you want to unbind the click ?
[06:16:14] <aqeel> on click  i want to unbind the hover mouseleave event
[06:16:44] <FrameFever> am I the next in the queue?
[06:17:26] <NodeX> FrameFever : 1 sec
[06:17:29] <aqeel> there is no queue...any can help any if they know the problem....
[06:18:42] <aqeel> i could and would like to help too but am new to jquery too....
[06:19:17] <aqeel> though i know bit here and there....and with reading about jquery site.....have some idea....
[06:19:36] <chuwiey> NodeX: it seems i'm getting my data successfully, and the headers look fine, but my alert still doesn't pop up... have any idea why, per chance?
[06:19:40] <NodeX> FrameFever : I did not know that wasn't possible
[06:19:43] <NodeX> sorry!
[06:20:09] <FrameFever> so I am already on the limit of jquery?
[06:20:15] <FrameFever> damn
[06:20:22] <NodeX> aqeel : in the click handler just do $(this).off('mouseleave');
[06:20:31] <NodeX> it's a javascript limit
[06:21:33] <aqeel> jquery has no limit it is limit of javascript itself...as jquery is build on javascript
[06:22:40] <Kambfhase> jquery is build on javascript << I thought JavaScript was build on jQuery???!!!
[06:23:01] <NodeX> check the jquery source - it might not evaluate the json string that  animate gets passed
[06:23:06] <NodeX> it's probably intentional
[06:23:20] <FrameFever> I think its a jquery limit
[06:24:19] <aqeel> nodex not working
[06:24:21] <Kambfhase> the only limit jQuery has it that its turing-complete!
[06:24:39] <NodeX> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.animate
[06:25:22] <NodeX> you can get round it by giving it a json string instead
[06:25:57] <NodeX> parse it outside your animate() ... something like  ... var j={var:val}.... animate(j,....
[06:26:04] <aqeel> javascript is introduction....jason,jquery,prototype are all based on this introduction of javascript....
[06:26:10] <muzone> Slightly off-topic but I don't know where else to ask. Target.com is hailed by many as having the world's finest ecommerce design. It's also based on a grid (http://www.subtraction.com/pics/0703/grids_are_good.pdf).
[06:26:11] <FrameFever> ah
[06:26:14] <muzone> But at http://home.no/dwaynie/target.png - is there any reason why the product listing columns, apart from the first one, don't follow the grid? Is it using a different grid?
[06:26:23] <NodeX> or build an array of your properties then parse them into a json object and pass that to it
[06:29:58] <aqeel> in html u have these properties....onClick,OnMouseOver....and there values are in return javascript....this.open,window.close......it is best to know those basic javascript handlings
[06:30:31] <aqeel> then continue with jquery, prototype, jasonp and alike
[06:31:25] <dabear_> jason
[06:31:28] <dabear_> haha
[06:31:38] <NodeX> heh
[06:32:25] <aqeel> http://www.json.org/
[06:32:28] <aqeel> my bad
[06:32:30] <aqeel> json
[06:34:08] <chuwiey> for some reason, my callback function for $.getJSON doesn't get called... I've checked, and I get the data I want.. but for some reason nothing is called... any ideas?
[06:35:58] <mika3> Morning   I need help with a jquery dialog box getting the selected value in a drop down       it just keeps giving me the first option    http://jsfiddle.net/peNdh/12/
[06:36:47] <Kambfhase> mika3: which dropdown?
[06:40:37] <mika3> first one   just keeps giving me select a recipient   click on the REQUEST AVAILABILITY
[06:40:43] <mika3> AND THE DIALOG WILL COME UP
[06:41:05] <mika3> change the value and then click SEND
[06:44:07] <armicron> what is wrong? http://pastebin.com/BYNcJYEL
[06:44:11] <john-dev> mika3, instead of copy/paste you should read the jquery article..
[06:44:56] <john-dev> "+nashi[0]+" -> '+nashi[0]+'
[06:45:20] <dwarder> is that |  $(.a .b).size()  | a right way to find and then manupulate my <div class="a b">test<div>
[06:45:22] <dwarder> ?
[06:46:10] <armicron> john-dev, no, it doesn't help
[06:46:57] <john-dev> is nashi set?
[06:47:11] <armicron> array
[06:48:03] <john-dev> tried attr yet?
[06:48:11] <armicron> works jQuery('a["href"="http://"+nashi[0]+".livejournal.com/profile"] > img')
[06:49:45] <LukeNukem> im building a view comments thingie in jquery, i mean on click it shows a div with php stuff
[06:49:51] <LukeNukem> but i cant use php stuff inside jquery code
[06:49:54] <LukeNukem> what is a solution?
[06:50:24] <john-dev> sure you can
[06:50:26] <john-dev> .load
[06:50:43] <john-dev> or $.ajax
[06:51:07] <LukeNukem> thats for loading and running scripts
[06:51:14] <nFFF> no its not
[06:51:18] <LukeNukem> i want to do an echo for example
[06:51:24] <LukeNukem> like <?php echo "idiot"; ?>
[06:51:28] <john-dev> you can get data with $.ajax and .html it into the div
[06:51:38] <LukeNukem> k
[06:51:44] <nFFF> load is easier
[06:51:49] <john-dev> probably, yes
[06:52:26] <nFFF> $('element').load('www.blah.com' #element);
[06:52:34] <nFFF> will load a specific block from the page
[06:53:39] <LukeNukem> so i will have to use ajax to pass the data-id to fetch_comments.php and make the php do all the fetching
[06:53:50] <LukeNukem> and make a div in it and select with #output
[06:53:52] <LukeNukem> and dispaly that
[06:53:55] <LukeNukem> display*
[06:54:58] <john-dev> you can just add the result from the ajax request to #div using jquery
[06:55:06] <john-dev> success function
[06:55:41] <LukeNukem> so i need to do the load after the link is click
[06:55:49] <LukeNukem> or do i just do .load
[06:56:23] <LukeNukem> $("#view_comments").live("load", function(e){ });
[06:56:38] <LukeNukem> i wonder how i will put the link to the php file...
[06:56:44] <LukeNukem> cos im using .live
[06:56:55] <Fiek> hey :)
[06:57:28] <LukeNukem> or is that wrong?
[06:57:37] <john-dev> you need to show us your code
[06:59:22] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/837898/
[06:59:32] <Fiek> Just started using jQuery, getting into web design now (I usually develop things). What I've done is created a PHP script that returns JSON, I need to decode the JSON and display it in a nice way on the page. I'm wanting to use $.ajax to get the response. Could anyone point me in the right direction
[06:59:35] <Fiek> ?
[07:00:20] <LukeNukem> Fiek, http://paste.ubuntu.com/837898/ the first ajax bit might help you.
[07:00:20] <john-dev> you are talking about the like.php right?
[07:00:33] <LukeNukem> john-dev, nope, that works just fine.. the one in the end
[07:00:38] <LukeNukem> #view_comments one
[07:01:35] <LukeNukem> when #view_comments is clicked, i want it to run php script..
[07:01:39] <LukeNukem> and output things.
[07:01:43] <john-dev> ok, you bind an onclick, check for the val() you stuff you need a make a jquery.get request or post or whatever. use it's success function to use the reply from php and .html it into the div..
[07:01:58] <john-dev> val() or*
[07:02:10] <Fiek> john-dev: Doesn't really help me that much
[07:02:27] <LukeNukem> john-dev, can you show me an example? cos im confused
[07:02:29] <john-dev> Fiek, huh?
[07:02:30] <LukeNukem> doing onclick and stuff
[07:03:37] <Fiek> john-dev: It doesn't solve my problem. I'm using $.ajax, I'd like to use the success: "block". Thanks :)
[07:04:22] <john-dev> $('#view_comments).bind('click',function() { ? get the value you want ? ajax.get or post with the value you just saved to a php file.. bind an on success to the ajax request and safe the result in $('#view_comment').html(result)}
[07:04:36] <john-dev> Fiek,  i didn't even talk to you :-/
[07:04:43] <nFFF> Just use getSON() and in success: just get the values from the object
[07:04:43] <LukeNukem> john-dev, something like this? http://paste.ubuntu.com/837905/
[07:04:50] <Fiek> john-dev: woops xD sorry
[07:05:03] <Fiek> LukeNukem: my replies to john above were meant for you ^
[07:05:17] <Fiek> john-dev: just woke up, guess I need more sleep ;)
[07:05:38] <LukeNukem> ok
[07:05:46] <john-dev> LukeNukem, well, i use live too all the time but ppl will tell you stop using it since it's not the best method, use bind if your div is ready as soon as the dom has been loaded
[07:06:07] <john-dev> LukeNukem, you need to make an ajax request, i can't see it in your code..
[07:06:20] <LukeNukem> wow jquery is confusing, i will work on that bind later. So is that code correct as of now, i can start doing the ajax request now?
[07:06:23] <john-dev> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[07:06:47] <john-dev> you dont need .load if you use an ajax request
[07:06:54] <john-dev> its just an alternativ way to include content
[07:06:54] <LukeNukem> ok
[07:08:21] <LukeNukem> what goes under datatype
[07:08:22] <LukeNukem> json right?
[07:08:50] <nFFF> $.getJSON('www.foo.com/obj.json', function(data) { alert(data); }); ?
[07:08:59] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/837910/
[07:09:18] <Mage> you may want to invest in some tabs
[07:09:33] <dwarder> what this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/
[07:09:38] <nFFF> LukeNukem, use jsfiddle
[07:09:39] <john-dev> nope
[07:09:40] <nFFF> why paste?
[07:09:41] <Fiek> .live() is deprecated :P
[07:10:10] <nFFF> wtf is tweets?
[07:10:12] <nFFF> some plugin?
[07:10:21] <LukeNukem> jsfiddle, i will have to write the html code and stuff.
[07:10:37] <nFFF> LukeNukem, does query_comments.php return a json object?
[07:10:51] <LukeNukem> i dont know.
[07:10:56] <nFFF> ...
[07:10:57] <LukeNukem> dont know anything about json
[07:11:12] <nFFF> So why are you sepcifying it as data type
[07:11:19] <john-dev> http://paste.ubuntu.com/837912/
[07:11:23] <nFFF> why don't you see what your url returns before building your ajax call?
[07:11:27] <john-dev> thats why you shouldnt use it, you cant need it here :-)
[07:11:58] <LukeNukem> Thanks good guy greg.
[07:12:24] <nFFF> john-dev, wha does overrideMimeType do/
[07:12:46] <dwarder> what this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/
[07:12:56] <john-dev> arg yeah, change x-user-defined to UTF-8
[07:13:05] <dwarder> i want 'test' to be red
[07:13:09] <dwarder> ?
[07:13:10] <john-dev> nFFF, you can declare encoding you use
[07:13:22] <axscode> hi guys, can someone helpout whats wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/7Pun6392
[07:13:38] <nFFF> john-dev, but if the url returns a json object, will the code work?
[07:14:02] <john-dev> sure.. since json can be utf-8 encoded too.. but in his case, he doesn't want to use a json object
[07:14:37] <john-dev> LukeNukem, you got it?
[07:14:52] <nFFF> Sorry i got him confused with Fiek
[07:14:53] <LukeNukem> the code, well does not work.
[07:15:07] <john-dev> you need to edit it to your needs..
[07:15:10] <LukeNukem> i did
[07:15:11] <LukeNukem> :>
[07:15:14] <john-dev> modify*
[07:15:20] <john-dev> show me the finished thing
[07:15:36] <Fiek> :P
[07:16:04] <nFFF> he doesn't even know what his request returns though ?? :| surely just trying to append data to the html if it's an object wont work
[07:16:18] <Fiek> nFFF: Are you talking to me? :P
[07:16:25] <nFFF> LukeNukem now
[07:16:28] <Fiek> ah, okay
[07:16:28] <dwarder> anyone? my simple question?
[07:16:33] <nFFF> but yea you should use $.getJSON
[07:16:45] <nFFF> dwarder, your using a 3rd party plugin
[07:16:48] <Fiek> nFFF: me?
[07:16:49] <Fiek> ;3
[07:16:49] <nFFF> ask the author
[07:16:51] <nFFF> Fiek yea
[07:17:07] <nFFF> Fiek paste your code
[07:17:11] <Fiek> nFFF: I'm relativly new to JavaScript, jQuery and JSON
[07:17:17] <Fiek> oh, I haven't actually written it yet
[07:17:18] <Fiek> :P
[07:17:26] <nFFF> probably the first step :>
[07:17:28] <john-dev> why do you use json here?
[07:17:38] <john-dev> php can format it the way you want and reply everything as html
[07:18:13] <nFFF> Might not be his choice/script
[07:18:47] <Fiek> I'm mainly doing this for experience
[07:18:48] <Fiek> with JSON
[07:18:52] <john-dev> posible yes..
[07:19:33] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/837917/
[07:19:34] <nFFF> Fiek, json is just a simple way of packaging data
[07:19:36] <nFFF> its an object
[07:19:40] <nFFF> so it has keys and values
[07:19:43] <Fiek> Oh I understand what JSON is
[07:19:58] <nFFF> in terms of jQuery it has a native method
[07:20:10] <nFFF> $.getJson(url, data, success);
[07:20:13] <john-dev> looks good LukeNukem
[07:20:15] <nFFF> simple
[07:20:24] <LukeNukem> maybe its my php.
[07:20:24] <john-dev> just replace  xhr.overrideMimeType( 'text/plain; charset=x-user-defined' ); with  xhr.overrideMimeType( 'text/plain; charset=UTF-8' );
[07:20:27] <john-dev> or any other encoding you use
[07:20:39] <Fiek> the idea is a little like XML(RPC), except JSON is a lot easier to read and maintain and is more interchangeable between different applications and scripts
[07:20:42] <Fiek> Am I right there?
[07:20:50] <john-dev> you will into problems with umlauts for example..
[07:20:56] <LukeNukem> i can just use an echo "the output" right
[07:20:57] <LukeNukem> in the php
[07:21:01] <LukeNukem> for testing purposes
[07:21:11] <john-dev> LukeNukem, test it by just using echo "yes";
[07:21:18] <john-dev> yepp
[07:21:23] <LukeNukem> ok
[07:21:28] <nFFF> LukeNukem, whats the full url ?
[07:21:31] <john-dev> you could also include html stuff, like <p>Yes</p>
[07:21:33] <nFFF> ... query_comments.php?status_id=1
[07:21:39] <LukeNukem> yes
[07:21:43] <nFFF> whats the domain?
[07:21:50] <LukeNukem> localhost
[07:21:52] <nFFF> k
[07:22:41] <john-dev> the php file must be in the root folder of your page
[07:22:52] <LukeNukem> it is under /var/www
[07:22:53] <LukeNukem> which is the root
[07:23:00] <john-dev> k
[07:23:13] <john-dev> use your web-console to debug if the ajax request gets a valid result
[07:23:19] <LukeNukem> however the js file is under /var/www/includes/scripts
[07:23:32] <john-dev> LukeNukem, that's no problem
[07:23:37] <LukeNukem> ok
[07:24:20] <john-dev> it must be in the same folder as your index
[07:24:27] <john-dev> of you need to change the path
[07:24:52] <LukeNukem> it is in the same folder as index
[07:24:59] <john-dev> ok
[07:25:01] <john-dev> should work
[07:25:43] <GeneralStupid> Hi
[07:25:44] <dwarder> nFFF: thanks,
[07:25:44] <dwarder> $('div.a').css('color,red');
[07:26:06] <dwarder> nFFF: still doesn't work
[07:26:13] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/9Qf9Q/
[07:26:37] <LukeNukem> well it does not work :(
[07:26:41] <nFFF> dwarder
[07:26:48] <nFFF> css('color','red')
[07:26:53] <GeneralStupid> I try do use the icons (trash, wrench) in a list, but only the first ones are displayed
[07:27:12] <nFFF> LukeNukem, where is it failing?
[07:27:17] <nFFF> Do you get an ok response?
[07:27:24] <nFFF> is it reach success?
[07:27:26] <LukeNukem> what do you mean by an 'ok response'
[07:27:26] <dwarder> nFFF: thanks, i feel bad about that
[07:27:40] <GeneralStupid> LukeNukem: 200 is OK
[07:27:44] <LukeNukem> i dont know, nothing related to what im doing in error console(no errors, no warnings)
[07:27:47] <LukeNukem> fail troll?
[07:27:54] <nFFF> success: alert('success');
[07:28:01] <nFFF> throw in some alerts or console.log()
[07:28:08] <nFFF> at various points and see where it fails
[07:28:15] <john-dev> the console should show you the ajax request
[07:28:23] <john-dev> and a http header response
[07:28:30] <john-dev> for example 404
[07:28:50] <LukeNukem> ok tried alerting, no alert so no success
[07:28:55] <nFFF> In chrome you need to turn XMLHttpRequests
[07:28:56] <john-dev> ok
[07:29:16] <john-dev> change bind to .live('click',fucntion.. even if it's deprecated..
[07:29:19] <john-dev> just for testing
[07:29:33] <LukeNukem> what do you mean
[07:29:48] <nFFF> LukeNukem paste your current code please
[07:29:53] <john-dev> there must be a reason why your click doesnt triggered
[07:30:08] <john-dev> bind only works with objects that have been created before the dom ifnished loading
[07:30:22] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/837924/
[07:30:25] <nFFF> so bind to one thats loaded with the dom
[07:30:27] <nFFF> and check the targe
[07:30:33] <LukeNukem> i use live
[07:30:45] <john-dev> your alert sucks
[07:31:03] <john-dev> change line 5 as i mentioned above
[07:31:35] <nFFF> don't use live
[07:31:35] <LukeNukem> what do you want me to change it to?
[07:31:38] <LukeNukem> to live?
[07:31:43] <nFFF> put your code to jsfiddle.net
[07:31:51] <john-dev> xhr.overrideMimeType( 'text/plain; charset=UTF-8' );
[07:32:01] <LukeNukem> jsfiddle wont work because there is no php there
[07:32:02] <john-dev> i asume you are german?
[07:32:02] <LukeNukem> to query
[07:32:08] <LukeNukem> no
[07:32:09] <LukeNukem> why
[07:32:17] <john-dev> cause of that qualified alert test..
[07:32:27] <nFFF> LukeNukem, be logical dude, is the click even firing?
[07:32:42] <john-dev> special chars like ??? wont be displayed as you want when not give jquery the encoding you use
[07:32:51] <john-dev> nFFF, nope :P
[07:32:53] <nFFF> is #view_comments there on page load, or added dynamically?
[07:33:07] <john-dev> copy line 8 to line 2
[07:33:11] <john-dev> and try it again..
[07:33:48] <LukeNukem> one secnd
[07:33:54] <LukeNukem> on page load
[07:34:40] <nFFF> if #view_comments is added after page load, then you need to bidn the click to a parent element thats there on page load
[07:34:47] <nFFF> and check the target of the click
[07:34:49] <john-dev> nFFF, nope
[07:34:57] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/837929/
[07:35:08] <nFFF> LukeNukem did it alert?
[07:35:11] <john-dev> since he does use .live, it doesnt matter when it is loaded
[07:35:13] <LukeNukem> Click worked alerted
[07:35:19] <nFFF> live is deprecated
[07:35:22] <nFFF> he shouldn't use it
[07:35:27] <LukeNukem> but result recieved did not output
[07:35:30] <john-dev> of course not
[07:35:38] <john-dev> jsut for testing proposes
[07:35:52] <LukeNukem>  yeaH?
[07:35:59] <john-dev> LukeNukem did you check the console?
[07:36:00] <nFFF> he should use .on() and bind to closest static parent, and check e.target to see if its the right element thats laoded dynamically
[07:36:10] <nFFF> I gotta go
[07:36:11] <nFFF> gl guys
[07:36:17] <LukeNukem> nFFF, thanks
[07:36:23] <LukeNukem> john-dev, wait

[07:56:47] <nFFF> mikunos
[07:56:56] <nFFF> $(this).parent.find()
[07:57:49] <ribot> or in other words: how can i find the attributes of $("#demo1") under DOM in firebug?
[07:59:21] <mikunos> nFFF ??
[08:00:13] <nFFF> sorry i can't even see anything to click

[08:00:50] <Dvx> Hi

[08:01:28] <Dvx> is there any tutorial for devenloping jquery irc client?
[08:03:03] <vsmith> Hello Gys quick question
[08:03:06] <nFFF> first of all
[08:03:11] <nFFF> mikunos
[08:03:18] <nFFF> what is the parent of the <a tags?
[08:03:27] <nFFF> for me its an <li :>
[08:03:37] <nFFF> so think about what your doing
[08:03:42] <jedimind_> you're*
[08:04:15] <nFFF> :>
[08:04:25] <vsmith> i am wondering is it possible to create a js bookmarklet that is able to take a partial screenshot of a webpage and upload it to a wordpress site?
[08:04:42] <nFFF> mikunos, simply your not think about the DOM structure correctly
[08:04:46] <nFFF> you;re**
[08:04:53] <nFFF> $("ul.subnav").toggle('fast').show(); works fine
[08:06:09] <mikunos> nFFF yes but I need to save the status of the items
[08:06:40] <xodusman> this might be somewhat an easy question, but what is exactly meant by uncaught exception: [object Object]
[08:06:49] <nFFF> (this).parent().find("ul.subnav").toggle('fast').show(); -> this = ul, parent = li, find = searching down the tree all descendants,,,, ul.subnav is a parent parent parent of all this
[08:06:55] <mikunos> nFFF I mean that if I refresh the page I can see all the items closed
[08:07:23] <mikunos> yes
[08:08:21] <nFFF> mikunos, throw the selector in parent() then
[08:08:39] <nFFF> $(this).parent('ul.subnav').toggle
[08:09:08] <mikunos> I need to save the status only
[08:09:19] <mikunos> by cookies
[08:10:01] <nFFF> what you said means 0 to me, perhaps someone else can help
[08:10:56] <De7ilx> is there any tutorial for devenloping jquery irc client?
[08:11:24] <mikunos> I need to save the status of the toggle within a cookie file in order to set the status of the items open or close
[08:11:29] <mikunos> is this more clear?
[08:12:17] <crashev> how to tell with .scrollLeft() that horizontal scroll reached the end so I can load more content via ajax to the certain div ?
[08:12:56] <nFFF> mikunos how does your code even attempt to do this
[08:17:11] <GeneralStupid> jQuery(this).attr("href") is always undefined, what can i do ?
[08:17:29] <nFFF> GeneralStupid post your code/
[08:17:37] <nFFF> jsfiddlen.net
[08:17:59] <nFFF> jsfiddle.net
[08:18:20] <nFFF> I'm guessing becuase $(this) doesn't have an attribute 'href' :>
[08:18:22] <GeneralStupid> http://dpaste.org/LCn9u/
[08:18:23] <mikunos> nFFF I need to create the function and I don't know where I have to start
[08:18:30] <nFFF> mikunos, how about google
[08:18:33] <nFFF> jquery cookie
[08:18:41] <mikunos> thanks nFFF
[08:18:56] <nFFF> GeneralStupid, jsfiddle.net
[08:19:46] <nFFF> GeneralStupid
[08:19:56] <nFFF> try $(this).parent().attr
[08:20:42] <nFFF> your binding the click the the button not the link
[08:21:00] <nFFF> the button doesn't have an attribute called href, it's parent (the link) does

[08:40:06] <Qalqi> I am getting error while using serialize array to submit form
[08:40:08] <Qalqi> http://dpaste.org/6XOib/
[08:40:15] <Qalqi> plz help
[08:44:07] <aqeel> .hover().click not playing nicely....althoug i cli8ck it still takes into account .hover [mouseleave] event and triggers it
[08:44:46] <LukeNukem> i have defined a variable id
[08:45:08] <LukeNukem> how to use that in ajax like url: 'query_comments.php?status_id=id',
[08:45:19] <nFFF> Qalqi, look at your submit
[08:45:25] <nFFF> and the selector
[08:45:27] <nFFF> then at the html
[08:45:28] <LukeNukem> so status_id=whatever_the_id_var_is
[08:45:32] <nFFF> and then ask if its on the right selector
[08:45:40] <LukeNukem> nFFF, any ideas?
[08:46:03] <nFFF> LukeNukem, look up ajax and pay attention to the 'data' part of the call
[08:46:38] <LukeNukem> umm, my question was only how do i set status_id=id;
[08:47:01] <nFFF> sure
[08:47:10] <nFFF> I told you how to find the answer
[08:48:16] <Qalqi> nFFF: i cant figure out wats wrong
[08:48:33] <nFFF> Qalqi, you are trying to .submit() something thats not a form
[08:49:25] <nFFF> look at line 17
[08:49:38] <nFFF> what is #cal the id of?
[08:50:02] <Qalqi> the id of the div that contains the form
[08:50:30] <nFFF> why not #caltag?
[08:50:53] <Qalqi> tried that too
[08:51:11] <nFFF> The submit event is sent to an element when the user is attempting to submit a form. It can only be attached to <form> elements
[08:51:38] <nFFF> jsfiddle.net
[08:51:43] <nFFF> upload the jquery and css there
[08:51:46] <nFFF> err html
[08:52:16] <Mainmam> you can't do this, can you?
[08:52:22] <Mainmam> $(this div)
[08:52:23] <Qalqi> except serializearray part every other function in the submit function seems to be excecuted
[08:52:37] <Mainmam> so you have to use filter functions on it instead
[08:53:09] <nFFF> Mainmam, $('div', this)
[08:53:32] <nFFF> Qalqi, read the docs
[08:53:42] <nFFF> The submit event is sent to an element when the user is attempting to submit a form. It can only be attached to <form> elements

[09:01:00] <xodusman> can someone help me with jqplot?
[09:02:13] <xodusman> or more specifically with geting data into jqplot - JSON, not sure why its failing...
[09:03:05] <Qalqi> nFFF i changed the id
[09:03:10] <Qalqi> still same problem
[09:03:44] <nFFF> Qalqi

[09:13:31] <gmad> can you advice me, how to do it?
[09:14:21] <ngharo> ?bbq @ gmad
[09:14:21] <bot-t> gmad, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[09:14:34] <Guest1388> hello!
[09:15:38] <gmad> I know BBQ, but I do not know, how to connect $("div").load() with hash navigation...
[09:16:12] <Guest1388> I am trying to post something to jquery forum but I see no posts of mine for about an hour
[09:16:15] <Guest1388> any ideas?
[09:47:10] <apineda> what does it mean if plugin, in the 'constructor' returns this.each ( function(){//more stuff});
[09:47:52] <Whirl3d> apply the "morestuff" to each item in the collection passed to the plugin
[09:48:34] <apineda> *lightbulb*
[09:48:48] <apineda> :)
[09:51:45] <Whirl3d> I have a function defined to apply a series of effects to a form element's parent li. I am not sure when it is best to call the function? I'm using .on and I can call it from the focusin handler, but that doesn't work for non-form elements taking focus.
[09:51:58] <Hussein_> hi, is there a way of getting the maximum scroll bar distance? im actually after the %'age that it's scrolled down the page but so far can only return the pixel value
[09:52:40] <apineda> Whirl3d: hover?
[09:52:56] <Whirl3d> And if I do it in the focusout, then if the next focused item is a form element, it shouldcall the funciton, if not, it should remain "highlighted". I'll post a fiddle
[09:53:52] <apineda> Hussein_: isn't that just the height of the page - viewport height? something like that.
[09:54:03] <Hussein_> nop
[09:54:43] <Hussein_> because
[09:54:58] <Hussein_> *cant think how to explain*
[09:54:59] <Hussein_> sec
[09:55:42] <Hussein_> oh nm i found a function
[09:55:44] <Hussein_> ty
[09:56:02] <apineda> share
[09:56:21] <LukeNukem> how can i remove a single br tag, not all just a single one.
[09:57:15] <Austin`> Using jQuery UI autocomplete, need to select a certain option when a user clicks a button, any ideas?
[09:57:31] <apineda> lots of ways, give it an id, xpath, use dom navigation ie.. sibling/children to locate it and remove it
[09:58:12] <Hussein_> apineda, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2387136/cross-browser-method-to-determine-vertical-scroll-percentage-in-javascript
[09:59:44] <apineda> ah scrollTop() ;) nice
[10:00:55] <Lycurgus> anybody know of melt effect, like House of Wax?
[10:01:16] <Lycurgus> *of a
[10:01:50] <Lycurgus> (i.e a jq pkg/lib that does)
[10:03:04] <apineda> so someone remind what happens when a jquery selector fails? null? empty collection?
[10:03:34] <apineda> I choose B
[10:03:34] <varius> i have a question.. executing a function like $("[name=checked]").prop('checked', true); works when called outside any function. but when i call this same function inside a callbackfunction nothing seems to happen. theese are jquery ui radio buttons btw.
[10:04:02] <varius> am i missing something?
[10:04:31] <apineda> I may be off but are you sure you dont need single quotes around the name?
[10:11:18] * Lycurgus checks out jqfancy.
[10:11:39] <Mainmam> so jquiry plugins are basically separate jquiry files you link to in your header?
[10:12:00] <Mainmam> i initially thought they were just dumped into the original jquiry file
[10:12:28] <Mainmam> but i guess that could bloat the original file unnecessarily
[10:13:33] <Mainmam> fuckin bots
[10:13:35] <Mainmam> fuckin up my shit
[10:16:55] <Mainmam> I don't understand why it's going to take business days lapsing for my online CS5 order to go through
[10:17:25] <Mainmam> doesn't adobe have code monkeys to do their credit card handling and product registering?
[10:19:07] <Nomikos> what was the best way to check if a checkbox was checked again - .is(':checked') ?
[10:23:39] <Nomikos> I have this now - http://pastebin.com/99GtcASd are there any obvious shortcuts I'm missing?
[10:30:48] <apineda> Nomikos: .toggleClass( className, switch ) might work for you
[10:35:22] <Whirl3d> why is it that clicking a checkbox element doesn't apply focus to that element?
[10:35:50] <Mekzholan> I'm doing foo=$('<event src="..."/>).load(...); and then append foo to the DOM. But the load() event never gets called :(
[10:36:13] <Mekzholan> sorry, -event +embed
[10:36:35] <Nomikos> Mekzholan: any javascript errors?
[10:36:36] <Whirl3d> try adding it to the dom before you load it, or try loading into a temporary dom elment first.
[10:36:38] <Mekzholan> What's the way to be notified when the embed has finished loading the SVG and has inserted it into the HTML DOM?
[10:36:59] <Mekzholan> Nomikos: no. Firebug console looks fine
[10:37:33] <Mekzholan> But clicking on the <embed> Element in Firebug I don't see that it's listening on my load()
[10:38:04] <Mekzholan> Oh, and the embed loads the SVG and displays it fine
[10:38:10] <saddishwasher> afternoon all, I'm wondering which is 'faster' when it comes to DOM insertion, string or node insertion?  I have this function currently but it seems somewhat slow and am wondering if turning these to node elements will be 'faster'. http://pastebin.com/hv2C2yJk
[10:38:57] <apineda> Mekzholan: maybe .live('load', function()) might be a dynamic problem.
[10:39:21] <apineda> I don't see whyu though
[10:39:34] <Whirl3d> Doesnt the element have to be added to the dom before you can call .load on it? var foo=$("<embed>").appendTo("someHolder").load(loadHandler).attr('src', embedsrc);
[10:40:28] <Whirl3d> that appends the empty embed element to the dom, then attaches the load handler before setting the "src" attribute. Once the src attribute is set, the load handler is triggered.
[10:40:31] <dabear_> saddishwasher: inserting ONE string into the dom is a lot quicker than inserting lots of elements
[10:41:20] <saddishwasher> dabear_, ok, even if I'm inserting multiple strings that are each lengthy and have many nested elements?
[10:41:50] <Mekzholan> Whirl3d: I *fear* that it's the order it gets added to the DOM - and I have no chance to change the order
[10:41:54] <Nomikos> saddishwasher: if this matters a lot, the best thing is to try and measure in different browsers, IMHO
[10:42:20] <Whirl3d> Except of course in IE, where if the embed element is cached, the load handler never fires. So it's best to immediately after your attr statement, do something like if (foo[0].complete) {foo.trigger('load');}
[10:42:23] <systemfault> saddishwasher: You could use an array and .join but it's not going to be that much faster.
[10:42:26] <apineda> saddishwasher: It's most likely not the approach but something else. you'll need thousands/millions of insertions to notice a difference
[10:42:27] <saddishwasher> Nomikos, well, this will only be for mobile safari as an iPhone app
[10:42:47] <saddishwasher> apineda, ok good point
[10:42:52] <apineda> I think the string method is quicker however because you are circumventing using the client side dom lib and letting the browser use it's internal mechanism
[10:42:55] <Whirl3d> Merkzholan, what do you mean?
[10:43:14] <saddishwasher> apineda, another good point
[10:43:56] <apineda> np
[10:44:25] <saddishwasher> well gents, it sounds like I have my answer, thank you
[10:46:25] <Whirl3d> Why doesn't .on("focusin") get triggered when a checkbox element is clicked. It gets focus, but doesn't fire the on handler...
[10:46:31] <Qalqi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9242974/jquery-doesnt-load-elements
[10:47:03] <Qalqi> dunno where i am doing it wrong
[10:47:20] <Nomikos> apineda: re: .toggleClass, good one, that worked (after I figured out my bug :-p)
[10:48:33] <Mekzholan> Whirl3d: I'm recursively creating a big hierachy of elements (the embed is in there somewhere) which at the end gets added to the page
[10:48:55] <LukeNukem> hi
[10:48:56] <Mekzholan> So I can't postpone the .load() call
[10:49:34] <apineda> Whirl3d: has 'focus' worked?
[10:49:40] <prometh> ok guys... here's my updated test case... and i still think i'm running into a jquery bug:   http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/
[10:49:40] <Whirl3d> You don't have to postpone it.
[10:50:14] <Mekzholan> Whirl3d: but otherwise the .load Event doesn't seem to be sent
[10:51:38] <Whirl3d> I usually create an div of width:0, height:0, display:"block", opacity:0 as a child of <body> and give it an ID of ('tempLoader"); then, when I need to preload an item, I first append it to the #temploader container, add my load handlers, then on complete, re-append the element to the original location.
[10:52:46] <Whirl3d> for your situation, you could do the same thing. write your complete handler to append the successfully loaded element to the heirarchy where you want it before appending the heirarchy to the dom
[10:54:09] <Mekzholan> Whirl3d: hm, sounds like an interesting idea
[10:55:05] <Whirl3d> or you can just append it in the heirarchy with the correct dimensions, but opacity:0 and then once you append the heirarchy, apply the load, src definition and it will load then.
[10:57:39] <IanWizard-Cloud> I'm trying to attach an event to 'ready' (or 'load'), and it's not working.  this is after the rest of the page has loaded, I'm attaching this to content loaded after the page is fully loaded.  It should still be firing though shouldn't it?
[10:58:31] <Whirl3d> I think it has to be appended to your document header
[10:58:59] <LukeNukem> Hi, can someone help me.. please go through this and you can find element id's like view_comments_1, view_comments_2..1 and 2 are the id of the status updates from php and stuff, now using jquery to add text boxes(for posting comments) and for showing ajax outputs, i need to know which one is clicked how can i do that? http://pastebin.com/QWqjvvSc
[10:59:55] <Whirl3d> so if your last line of your document was a script that defined a .ready handler and appended that definition to the document header, it should work.
[11:00:26] <IanWizard-Cloud> Whirl3d: but it's for content that's loaded in dynamically, at an undefined time.
[11:00:42] <IanWizard-Cloud> Whirl3d: I should also mention that I've tried live, and delegate.
[11:00:58] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: make the click event handler grab the id - $('a').click(function() {alert('clicked '+ $(this).attr('id');});
[11:01:00] <Whirl3d> then it sounds like you should be handling the dynamically loaded content callbacks
[11:01:29] <Whirl3d> Don't use .live or .delegate with 1.7.1 -- or so it has been said. Try .on instead.
[11:01:42] <IanWizard-Cloud> Whirl3d: I'm on 1.5.x
[11:02:08] <IanWizard-Cloud> Whirl3d: I've addopted a site, and that's whats there.. I'll upgrade when I have time.. unless that would solve it now
[11:02:10] <Whirl3d> Sounds like you need to create a loadhandler that does your ready handler funciton in the load callback
[11:02:37] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: *cough* add another ) after ('id')
[11:02:47] <IanWizard-Cloud> Whirl3d: oh, by load callback, you mean the one defined in load()
[11:03:01] <LukeNukem> well there could be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or more status updates, so we dont know which one is clicked..
[11:03:04] <Whirl3d> IanWizard-Cloud, if you could post some code to show what you are trying to do, that's the only way anybody can really help.
[11:03:11] <LukeNukem> ooh
[11:03:13] <Whirl3d> sure
[11:03:17] <Whirl3d> or .ajax
[11:03:18] <IanWizard-Cloud> sorry, ok
[11:03:29] <LukeNukem> and then use that id with the other click right Nomikos ?
[11:03:52] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: if you have the id string, with some substr() you can get the number, and you should be able to do whatever
[11:04:04] <Whirl3d> rather than on the ready event for the dom, just apply the same functions in the load success callback object for the dynamic content
[11:04:06] <LukeNukem> can i PM, you seem not to be understanding what im saying.
[11:04:45] <Nomikos> Uhm. can you make a smaller example perhaps, then it'll be easier to understand the problem and explain the solution
[11:05:31] <apineda> LukeNukem: I think thge point is you'll need some kind of identifier
[11:05:31] <Whirl3d> LukeNukem, use the .on handler and you are good to go
[11:06:17] <rgoodwin> very dumb newb question, but i'm trying to race to make a phone gap app for my friend before her cancer party tonight, and quickly re-learning JS and JQM (which freakin rocks btw)
[11:06:26] <rgoodwin> i want to have a little "Days since cancer free" countdown
[11:06:27] <Whirl3d> $("commentHolder").on({focusin:function (e) { var comment=$(e.target).closest('.commentClass"); ...do whatever...}});
[11:06:44] <rgoodwin> 3 column grid, with header text/graphics, then under neath, the Days, Hours, Minutes
[11:07:03] <rgoodwin> suggestions on the right way to do the updating of the time values?
[11:07:31] <rgoodwin> normally i'd do a loop in functional programming but was thinking this is not right for event based :)
[11:07:34] <Nomikos> a.. countdown? wouldn't a count-up be more appropriate? o_O
[11:07:39] <Whirl3d> setInterval
[11:07:46] <Engin> recommended command like html[,css[,js]] minifying tool (which is known to be compabilable/runnable on windows) ?
[11:07:50] <Engin> command line*
[11:08:02] <LukeNukem> here is my js file http://paste.ubuntu.com/838205/
[11:08:08] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, please can you go through that
[11:08:31] <systemfault> Engin: The YUI compression can compress both JS and CSS, html doesn't make a lo of sense.
[11:08:36] <rgoodwin> lol
[11:08:42] <rgoodwin> nomikos ys
[11:08:43] <rgoodwin> duh
[11:08:45] <rgoodwin> hhe
[11:08:50] <rgoodwin> that would send WRONG message
[11:08:55] <Nomikos> ok, just checking :)
[11:08:56] <rgoodwin> set interval ok i can goo ogle that up
[11:08:58] <systemfault> Engin: Also, set your server to gzip files.
[11:09:05] <Nomikos> congrats to you and your friend btw :)
[11:09:20] <Engin> it is gzip, now I'm finilizing my deployment scripts
[11:09:46] <Whirl3d> LukeNukem, if you can use 1.7.1, then apply the .onHandler to handle your click events
[11:09:51] <rgoodwin> nomikos!, thanks!
[11:09:57] <rgoodwin> feature 1 is the count up
[11:09:59] <Whirl3d> ?.on@LukemNukem
[11:10:00] <bot-t> LukemNukem, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:10:07] <rgoodwin> feature 2 if i get rolling quickly enough is to add a second page
[11:10:09] <LukeNukem> i use 1.7.1
[11:10:13] <LukeNukem> wait a se
[11:10:14] <LukeNukem> sec*
[11:10:15] <rgoodwin> that uses local storage or something to let people leave messages
[11:10:18] <rgoodwin> that she can go back and view
[11:10:27] <prometh> scott_gonzalez:  http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/43/
[11:10:37] <LukeNukem> the file says jquery1.4
[11:10:40] <LukeNukem> i guess its 1.7.4
[11:10:58] <Whirl3d> it's probably 1.4, can you change that?
[11:11:07] <dddbmt> Have anyone ever succeded extracting the "formatDate" method from the ui datepicker?
[11:11:12] <LukeNukem> yes
[11:11:13] <LukeNukem> i can
[11:11:30] <LukeNukem> let me just get the latest
[11:11:39] <Whirl3d> I need to see some html of the section you are working with
[11:12:00] <buzaga> whats the recommended setting for having some different behaviours in mobile and desktop version of a website? I'd like to use jquery mobile dialog if users on a smartphone and be free to use some other one for desktop..
[11:12:08] <LukeNukem> This is fine right? http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.min.js
[11:12:32] <Whirl3d> sure, or google's cdn
[11:12:57] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/43/  ... if you click the menu items and the buttons now that i've slowed them down, the animations get messed up
[11:12:58] <Engin> systemfault: looks good
[11:13:00] <LukeNukem> i prefer to store it locally because i might not have internet sometimes
[11:13:12] <rgoodwin> this is if i can remember how to do proper css layout
[11:13:26] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: since i'm trying to catch up to the stuff you've added, how would i correct the new issue?
[11:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see an issue.
[11:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> What specifically do you think needs to change?
[11:13:57] <Whirl3d> so, LukeNukem, where is the HTML structure for your comments area?
[11:14:12] <LukeNukem> hold on, let me get that for ya..
[11:14:52] <LukeNukem> line 91 on so
[11:15:39] <handibar> I've added the theme switcher to an output screen so various folks can pick whatever theme floats their boat.. thing is that there's large section of the page not using the CSS from JQuery.. Is there any guides to the internal classes so I could get my page to follow the themes more?
[11:16:01] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: if you click the third menu item and then click its <button> before the animation completes, the other menu items do not return to being visible
[11:17:20] <rgoodwin> do UI blocks override styles like centering?
[11:17:26] <rgoodwin> or am i just too rusty at this
[11:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> prometh: You need to tell the animations to jump to the end: http://jsfiddle.net/NgQ7S/44/
[11:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> .stop( true, true ) not .stop()
[11:18:33] <prometh> but that's not a smooth animation, hten... every time they'll chop to the end
[11:18:46] <IanWizard-Cloud> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/4n3JM/    sorry, thought I may have found a solution.
[11:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> Then never call stop.
[11:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> But you'll need to do manual queueing then.
[11:19:09] <prometh> manual queueing?
[11:19:19] <prometh> i've read about queue()
[11:19:21] <prometh> but, how would that apply here?
[11:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> You can't show/hide in the middle of an animation (inside expandListItem) if you're not going to stop the animations.
[11:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter if it's not smooth.
[11:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's a ridiculous edge case.
[11:19:51] <prometh> edge case?
[11:20:10] <prometh> yes, but i'm an intricate animator.. i'm trying to learn how i will apply things in the future
[11:20:25] <prometh> cuz i WILL be running into this again.. i know it... and you're the only one who has an answer to this
[11:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, someone clicking the button before the animation completes and noticing (and caring) about a minuscule jump in the matter of half a second is an edge case.
[11:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> Use a realistic animation duration and see if it bothers you.
[11:21:01] <prometh> ah, well in this case it doesn't matter.. but from experience, it will happen in the future.... i come from a flash background, so this is similar, just a different library
[11:21:03] <xodusman> hello.
[11:21:57] <prometh> the most difficult thing is animating with the DOM
[11:22:13] <prometh> so, how would manual queueing help with maintaining the smoothest of animation in a situation like this?
[11:22:19] <systemfault> Yeah... my guess is because it's hacked...
[11:23:08] <IanWizard-Cloud> Of course if I could attache a global .load() callback, I could use that as well.
[11:23:38] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: still there?
[11:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yes.
[11:24:06] <IanWizard-Cloud> but I can't attach it to every single load() call. in my case
[11:24:06] <prometh> so, how would manual queueing help with maintaining the smoothest of animation in a situation like this?
[11:24:11] <xodusman> http://jsfiddle.net/qSvNv/ not sure why jplog is being drawn but no data appears.
[11:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> You need to manually queue the showing/hiding of the children.
[11:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> The change that we made to expandListItem won't work if you're not using .stop()
[11:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> b
[11:25:01] <prometh> how would a queue be any different?
[11:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> Because you don't want to show/hide them synchronously, you want to do it when all queued animations complete.
[11:25:20] <scott_gonzalez> That whole function needs to run at the end of the animation, not immediately.
[11:25:26] <prometh> oh, so you're saying use the animation callback
[11:25:37] <prometh> oh, well i need it immediately... what options do i have? :)
[11:26:10] <prometh> would it be a bad idea to stop(), hide(), then return to the height it was previously at?
[11:26:12] <prometh> then animate
[11:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> Your options are to leave it as is (fine for everyone) or manually calculate all the dimensions and use .animate() instead of .slideDown/Up()
[11:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> If you can always get it to go to the correct height, you can do that.
[11:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> But you have to realize that .stop() will leave the element with style.height set.
[11:27:07] <prometh> this is where jquery needs to be updated with an updateTo() or something
[11:27:14] <prometh> kinda like TweenLite for Flash
[11:27:26] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what that is.
[11:27:30] <prometh> animation library
[11:27:32] <prometh> verry very good
[11:27:35] <xodusman> hello. can someone help?
[11:27:37] <systemfault> I think the opposite :P All animations should be in its own lib :/
[11:27:51] <systemfault> jquery shouldn't have that.
[11:27:57] <xarxer> What's the general way of logging in using jQuery? I imagine one would use $.post() to post username and password to a php-script. But in the php-script, should one use the SESSION-cookie or what?
[11:28:04] <prometh> hmm, good idea... is there a more advanced jquery library?
[11:28:10] <prometh> more advanced ANIMATION jquery library?
[11:29:03] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: thank you very much for the insight... i now have more direction :)
[11:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[11:30:03] <scott_gonzalez> Good luck.
[11:30:10] <xarxer> no one?
[11:31:04] <xodusman> anyone know another way to trackign down a bug besides stepping program, the browser reports no errors.
[11:33:54] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: i kind of have anohter question that goes along with what i was asking
[11:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[11:34:16] <prometh> i suppose i should direct it to the whole channel first,t hough
[11:34:23] <prometh> but..
[11:35:16] <prometh> $("p").css("height", old_height);  // say i have mutliple p's, how would i individually set each's old height value?
[11:35:25] <prometh> each() i guess?
[11:35:31] <xodusman> store in a temp variable
[11:35:39] <prometh> but there could be many
[11:35:55] <xodusman> $.each
[11:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, .each()
[11:37:21] <prometh> how would i start the animation from its old height after doing a show() ?
[11:37:37] <scott_gonzalez> $( "p" ).each(function() { $( this ).data( "prevHeight", $( this ).height() ); })
[11:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> It will always start from it's current height.
[11:37:51] <prometh> $("p").each(i, function(){ var old_height=$(this).css("height"); $(this).show().css("height",oldheight).slideUp(); });
[11:37:58] <prometh> hmm
[11:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that getting/setting is completely unnecessary.
[11:38:17] <prometh> didn't know about height()... cool :)   yes, i'm new to jquery
[11:38:17] <scott_gonzalez> You're not doing anything.
[11:38:32] <prometh> yeah
[11:38:45] <prometh> what do i do with prevHeight, then?
[11:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really have time to explain all the logic behind complex animations.
[11:40:54] <prometh> k :(
[11:41:03] <prometh> this is all i need to know though
[11:41:15] <prometh> i'm good with logic, just not jquery
[11:42:11] <prometh> what if i pay you? :)
[11:42:51] <prometh> you deserve it anyway
[11:43:54] <prometh> scott_gonzalez
[11:45:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, I consult for $150/hr.
[11:45:41] <prometh> you CONSULT for $150/hr? yeah right.
[11:46:49] <prometh> all i need is 1 more question answered.. but i'd be willing to pay for the help you've already given me
[11:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> I can answer one more question :-)
[11:47:15] <prometh> how much $?
[11:47:25] <scott_gonzalez> Free for one more question.
[11:47:33] <prometh> i want to pay you :)
[11:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Then whatever you want.
[11:47:49] <prometh> $20?
[11:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. Whatever you want.
[11:48:01] <umren> is there something like hasAttr in jquery same as hasClass ?
[11:48:13] <prometh> k /notice me your email
[11:48:21] <umren> i need to check that attribute with some value exists
[11:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I was serious about $150/hr for my normal rate.
[11:48:50] <prometh> that's insane
[11:48:59] <prometh> then again, are you your own business?
[11:49:06] <prometh> dealing with big clients
[11:50:11] <prometh> the highest i ever went was $100/hour and that wasn't for consulting, haha
[11:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, my IRC client just died.
[11:50:33] <prometh> it may have been for prostitution, but i can't remember :P
[11:50:34] <prometh> hehe
[11:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:50:45] <prometh> what's your paypal email?
[11:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> I work for appendTo, but I do contracting on the side.
[11:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> scott.gonzalez@gmail.com
[11:51:04] <scott_gonzalez> I can tell you that $150/hr is not high for what I do.
[11:51:22] <nFFF> umren, .attr()
[11:51:25] <prometh> appendTo training solutions?
[11:51:31] <prometh> what do you do, if you dont' mind my asking
[11:51:49] <zakwilson> He could tell you, but then he'd have to kill you.
[11:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> Development, split between client work and open source work.
[11:52:51] <umren> nFFF if i chain .attr('id','something') it just adds that attr to chain, and i need to check that it exists, that's all, something like if('something')
[11:52:58] <prometh> you work for appendTo the jquery library, or. .?
[11:53:20] <zakwilson> That description could apply to work not even worth $20/hour up to work worth so much it's hard to put a price on.
[11:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://appendto.com
[11:53:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's a company, not a library :-P
[11:53:33] <prometh> oh, so you guys MADE jquery?
[11:53:35] <waxjar> autocomplete IN the input field, how would you guys do something like that?
[11:54:05] <scott_gonzalez> Well, appendTo was founded by two jQuery team members.
[11:54:18] <prometh> cool
[11:54:20] <nFFF> umren
[11:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> And there are appendTo employees, such as myself, who are jQuery board members
[11:54:37] <nFFF> attr('blah') returns true or false
[11:54:44] <prometh> i didn't htink any web developer got paid more than $100/hour
[11:54:52] <danzik17> scott_gonzalez: jquery 1.2.6 on the appendTo site?  =P
[11:54:56] <nFFF> attr('blah','foo') changes the value of blah
[11:55:02] <prometh> i thought only those doctor programmers did... writing software for artificial hearts, etc
[11:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> danzik17: :-) Whatever works
[11:55:25] <umren> nFFF i need to check true/false for a specific valur of given attribute
[11:55:29] <umren> value
[11:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> Good web dev companies charge $150-$300/hr generally.
[11:55:41] <prometh> money sent
[11:55:44] <nFFF> ierrr
[11:55:55] <prometh> yes, but that's the company.. not the developer
[11:55:56] <nFFF> sorry it what ma i saying
[11:55:58] <umren> scott_gonzalez i guess web dev compani is not 1 man.
[11:56:04] <umren> *y
[11:56:05] <nFFF> attr('blah') returns the value
[11:56:09] <zakwilson> Having core developers of a major open source library work on your code is worth more hourly than some random off craigslist is.
[11:56:17] <zakwilson> (signed -- some random off craigslist)
[11:56:22] <ZeeO> what do you guys suggest to make a table sexy and sortable
[11:56:29] <nFFF> so if($('.class').attr('foo') == 'bar')
[11:56:40] <umren> ah, cool
[11:56:41] <cybersholt> Zee) data tables is nice
[11:56:45] <umren> nFFF will try that
[11:56:48] <prometh> i should really get on a major open source library team, then
[11:56:49] <umren> nFFF thanks
[11:56:53] <nFFF> np
[11:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but individual devs can charge the same amount.
[11:57:06] <cybersholt> Zee0 data tables is nice
[11:57:15] <ZeeO> ok i will check that out
[11:57:15] <nFFF> I don't get why in javascript they have ==/===, === should be default
[11:57:16] <ZeeO> thanks
[11:57:21] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: okay.. now for my question :)
[11:57:25] <nFFF> a wierd thing
[11:57:51] <prometh> how would i retrieve the previousHeight, stop(), show(), set height back to previousHeight, animate() ?
[11:57:57] <cybersholt> no problem
[11:58:16] <danzik17> nFFF: read somewhere that brendan eich tried to do that and got shot down, hence the introduction of === and !==
[11:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes that can be really tricky. If you actual scenario is as simple as your example (no explicit heights), then you can store the height after you call .stop(), remove the inline height (set height to "auto"), get the new height, set the height back to what you got originally, then animate to the full height.
[11:59:29] <zakwilson> Working on OSS stuff is part of what I think should be expected of a freelancer.
[11:59:32] <scott_gonzalez> Did that make sense?
[12:00:10] <zakwilson> It's part of how you can make others aware of your value.
[12:00:14] <prometh> why would i need to "get the new height" ?
[12:00:21] <prometh> or is that an automatic thing?
[12:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> Because you'll need to .animate({ height: fullHeight }) instead of .slideDown()
[12:00:46] <prometh> ohhh
[12:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> Since the element is already visible (it has some height), you won't be able to use .slideDown()
[12:01:02] <prometh> then onComplete set height to auto
[12:01:04] <prometh> all manual animation
[12:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> The first thing .slideDown() will do is say "Is this element hidden?" If the answer is no, it thinks it has nothing to do.
[12:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[12:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> This might get even tricker though, if you have padding/border/margin.
[12:02:04] <prometh> wow, okay, hehe
[12:02:10] <prometh> and yeah, i use wrappers with padding stuff
[12:02:22] <prometh> ok, i'm gonna try writing a quick example to see how off i am
[12:02:35] <IanWizard-Cloud> Is there any way that I can bind a handler to the page, so that when items matching a certain selector are loaded (at an undetermined point), it will get called, with those items, either as context (this), or passed in to the handler?
[12:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> prometh: Your final solution will probably need to animate height, paddingBottom, paddingTop
[12:03:03] <IanWizard-Cloud> something like .live('load')?
[12:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> But the logic will be the same for everything. And you just calculate them all at the same time.
[12:03:19] <prometh> scott_gonzalez
[12:03:34] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: that's a pretty good idea, never thought of animating those instead of adding wrappers
[12:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's what .slideDown() does.
[12:05:02] <prometh> i had jumpiness with it, but... well i mostly use animate() anyway
[12:05:07] <prometh> changed it to slideUp/Down in my test case
[12:06:44] <prometh> $("p").each(i, function(){ var prevHeight=$(this).stop().height();  var newHeight=$(this).show().height();  $(this).height(prevHeight).animate({height:newHeight}); });
[12:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> newHeight = $(this).css("height", "auto").height();
[12:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's already shown.
[12:07:48] <prometh> css() woul dbe faster than show(), ok
[12:08:02] <prometh> would using data() be faster than 3 separate chains?
[12:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> .show() just changes style.display, it won't change style.height
[12:08:14] <prometh> ah
[12:08:25] <scott_gonzalez> No, .data() will be slower, but you're not going to notice it.
[12:08:43] <prometh> i'll go with vars, then :)
[12:08:47] <prometh> looks nicer anyway
[12:08:49] <prometh> $("p").each(i, function(){ var prevHeight=$(this).stop().height();  var newHeight=$(this).css("height","").height();  $(this).height(prevHeight).animate({height:newHeight}); });
[12:09:06] <ShaunR> alert(data.data); works fine but the following does seam to be, where am i going wrong.. ("#row_accountid_" + data.data).hide();
[12:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yup,
[12:09:20] <prometh> whew :) thanks ... i'll try all this out
[12:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> You'll also want to set the height to "" at theend
[12:09:30] <prometh> right
[12:09:33] <prometh> thanks :)
[12:09:41] <mutedia> maybe I'm putting my foot in my mouth but could you juste user like var oldvars = new array($("p").each.css('height'))
[12:09:46] <ShaunR> bah, n/m i got it
[12:09:48] <prometh> there should really be a function for this in jquery
[12:09:49] <prometh> feature request? :)
[12:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's one of those bugs that you wouldn't notice immediately
[12:10:15] <prometh> yeah, btu as content changes, etc
[12:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> But if the width changes, the element wouldn't reflow properly since it has a set height.
[12:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> Right.
[12:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> A feature request for this would certainly get closed as wontfix.
[12:10:40] <prometh> how come?
[12:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's too high level. This is a complex animation.
[12:10:42] <Hussein_> its not normal for .html() to return an escaped string is it?
[12:10:53] <Hussein_> even if the html is inside a noscript tag..?
[12:11:10] <prometh> you guys should check out TweenLite for inspiration.. it covers stuff like this
[12:11:18] <prometh> TweenLite/TweenMax
[12:11:29] <prometh> it's Actionscript/Flash
[12:12:56] <kanzie> Im having a memory-leak in my application and no matter how much I read I just don't know where to start addressing it. One suspicion is that it is $.jsonp() that is not throwing away my received data properly once I have worked the result. I have 1000's of detached elements in my heap snapshot and my task manager shows the app growing with about 1mb per 10seconds though it is loading about 6k from server and supposed to throw most of it
[12:16:08] <methoddk> man i can't join #python anymore
[12:16:20] <methoddk> because of net split and not identifying
[12:17:03] <vishesh> Hi. Is there anyway I can POST to a page without using form ( non-ajax way)
[12:17:10] <cybersholt> methoddk i was able to join but it sent me to #python-unregistered
[12:33:20] <Whirl3d> IanWizard-Cload....button elements don't fire a .ready event
[12:33:40] <Mekzholan> Whirl3d: with some experiments it's still not working:
[12:33:52] <k1ng__> !up 76.74.103.43
[12:33:59] <k1ng__> .up 76.74.103.43
[12:34:02] <Mekzholan> $('body').append('<embed src="plugins/clock/clock_pure.svg"/>').live('load',function(){... - the function doesn't get called
[12:34:27] <Mekzholan> and the Firebug doesn't show it as an registered event :(
[12:34:43] <nFFF> live?
[12:34:44] <Whirl3d> because its being loaded before you apply the load handler
[12:34:56] <ajpiano> load doesn't bubble
[12:35:01] <Whirl3d> and I told you not to use .live...people will freak out in here
[12:35:02] <ajpiano> you can't use load with live or delegate etc
[12:35:03] <Whirl3d> lol
[12:35:37] <Mekzholan> No matter if using .live or .load: $('body').append('<embed src="plugins/clock/clock_pure.svg"/>').load(function(){... also doesn't work :(
[12:35:57] <ajpiano> you're binding a load event to the body, not the embed
[12:36:23] <ajpiano> and i don't know if you can attach handlers to <embed> with jquery
[12:36:41] <ajpiano> pretty sure you can't
[12:37:04] <nFFF> Mekzholan, what is it exactly you're trying to achieve?
[12:37:32] <Mekzholan> also $('<embed>').appendTo('body').load() doesn't work
[12:37:38] <kanzie> Im having a memory-leak in my application and no matter how much I read I just don't know where to start addressing it. One suspicion is that it is $.jsonp() that is not throwing away my received data properly once I have worked the result. I have 1000's of detached elements in my heap snapshot and my task manager shows the app growing with about 1mb per 10seconds though it is loading about 6k from server and supposed to throw most of it
[12:37:38] <kanzie> This is driving me nuts
[12:37:46] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L18-23 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L44-46
[12:37:49] <ajpiano> Mekzholan: ^^
[12:37:54] <ajpiano> you can't attach any events to <embed> elements
[12:38:06] <Mekzholan> nFFF: basically I want to have a SVG in my web page and now give some of it's elements an event handler
[12:38:32] <Mekzholan> nFFF: but so far I can't even access the SVG at "setup time".
[12:39:09] <Mekzholan> ajpiano: well, how can I then figure out if it has setup it's content?
[12:39:32] <nFFF> I don't have much experience with SVG files
[12:39:33] <ajpiano> not sure
[12:39:39] <ajpiano> you could try waiting until window.load instead of document ready
[12:39:43] <Whirl3d> http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[12:40:26] <Mekzholan> ajpiano: all that's happening already inside a $(document).ready(function()...
[12:40:42] <ajpiano> Mekzholan: ..
[12:41:02] <ajpiano> that's what i'm saying
[12:41:04] <ajpiano> try it in window load instead
[12:41:14] <nFFF> :D
[12:41:48] <nFFF> Your trying to manipulate the SVG code directly with jQuery or just the object?
[12:41:49] <Mekzholan> ajpiano: hm, I don't understand - how do I figure out there if this <embed> has finished?
[12:42:14] <Mekzholan> Whirl3d: thanks. But I know that lib already :)
[12:42:31] <ajpiano> Mekzholan: window.load waits for everything to be finished loading before firing
[12:42:38] <ajpiano> at least, it waits for images to complete, for instance
[12:42:44] <ajpiano> not sure if it waits for SVG but it might be worth a shot
[12:42:45] <Mekzholan> nFFF: currently with oridnary jQ. That's also working fine for the subset I need
[12:42:57] <Whirl3d> I give up. You have a library that will do it for you, you have one of the foremost exports on jquery telling you how to do it and you still won't listen. That's rough. I'm outta here.
[12:43:06] <Whirl3d> *experts
[12:43:07] <Whirl3d> lol
[12:43:39] <Mekzholan> Whirl3d: ??? I think I do listen.
[12:43:59] <ravenzz> Mekzholan what are you trying to do?
[12:44:17] <nFFF> ravenzz, think he's trying to see if a SVG file has been loaded to the DOM
[12:44:47] <Mekzholan> ajpiano: ok, that's a try. I hope it doesn't have problems with me adding the <embed> "afterwards"
[12:45:24] <Mekzholan> ravenzz: I need to be sure that the SVG is there so that I can decend into it to add (additional) event handlers
[12:45:36] <Mekzholan> (make one of it's elements clickable)
[12:46:11] <nFFF> Mekzholan
[12:46:20] <nFFF> why don't you just check to see if it exiss and set a timeout
[12:46:24] <ravenzz> oh I see
[12:47:04] <Mekzholan> nFFF: you mean polling for it?
[12:47:08] <nFFF> yea
[12:47:21] <ravenzz> aren't svg treated as images? I mean, the onload event should work on it?
[12:47:34] <Mekzholan> yup, that should hopefully work.
[12:47:49] <nFFF> Polling isn't the ideal
[12:47:50] <ravenzz> try it and see
[12:47:52] <nFFF> but im sure it would work
[12:48:15] <Mekzholan> ravenzz: that's my problem. The onLoad seems to not work on the <embed>. (And I need an <embed> and not an <img> as I need to modify the SVG afterwards)
[12:49:08] <dogarrhea2> I am in need of a tree widget the +/- collapse expand kind of functionality
[12:49:20] <ravenzz> I have no experience with SVG files
[12:49:35] <ravenzz> do you have a live link?
[12:50:56] <nFFF> function checkSVG() { var exists = document.getElementById("id").getSVGDocument() || FALSE; if(!exists) { setTimeout(checkSVG(),300); } esle
[12:52:10] <Mekzholan> ravenzz: lots - all those google told me. But to get an easy start experimenting you could take Inkscape, create a little drawing and include it in the web page by an <embed src="...svg">. Firebug can easily decent into it then
[12:54:03] <ravenzz> Mekzholan can I start from this http://jsfiddle.net/Uyxuc/ =
[12:54:03] <ravenzz> ?
[12:54:07] <umren> how to make "if" statement fire each time when event is firing https://gist.github.com/1804159  here it just fires one time, if "ID" becomes different - if should be false
[12:55:14] <dogarrhea2> hrm no tree widget in jqueryui or elsewhere
[12:55:29] <dogarrhea2> i wonder how fail can jqueryui be..
[12:59:50] <dareign85> hey--- when i have  jQuery(".blah").live('click', function() {});  how do i reference the element in the function?
[13:00:04] <Mekzholan> ravenzz: I'm not very good at jsfiddle. The start looks good - by the code in the JavaScript pane doesn't seem to work together with the output. (I.e. a $('embed') returns Null, although it should find the <embed>...)
[13:00:15] <dareign85> i'm trying to remove one of its classes
[13:00:19] <mansoor-s> dareign85:  $(this).doStuff
[13:00:52] <dareign85> is that the same as jQuery(this)
[13:00:54] <dareign85> ?
[13:01:14] <dareign85> jQuery(this).removeClass("blah"); isn't working
[13:03:32] <dareign85> that isn't working
[13:03:50] <dareign85> the only thing that works is jQuery(".blah").removeClass()
[13:03:57] <dareign85> but it removes /every/ class
[13:04:01] <dareign85> i just want the element clicked
[13:06:40] <kanzie> anyone know where I can read about good patterns for how to manipulate the DOM using jQuery WITHOUT causing massive memory-leaks… Im loosing 1mb per 10 seconds right now without doing much at all so something is really funky
[13:06:45] <dareign85> oh i see
[13:08:33] <dareign85> its posible to do var eref = jQuery(this); right
[13:08:36] <dareign85> to use it later
[13:08:59] <karbassi> Writing some quick code, but for some reason, the animation function doesn't work with $(this).data. Here's the code: jQuery('.info-graph .graphbar').css("width", 0).animate({'width': jQuery(this).data('width') + '%' }, 1000);
[13:09:32] <ajpiano> karbassi: there's no 'this' there dawg
[13:09:49] <ajpiano> karbassi: that is to say, there is a this there, but it's still 'window'
[13:10:01] <ajpiano> if you want to pluck some width value that you stored in each .graphbar's data
[13:10:07] <karbassi> ah
[13:10:15] <karbassi> was trying to avoid a each loop
[13:10:21] <ajpiano> you have to do .each(function() { $(th)s.animate({ wat: $(this).data("wat") }); }
[13:10:23] <karbassi> thanks dawg
[13:10:33] <ajpiano> np
[13:13:06] <ravenzz> Mekzholan http://jsfiddle.net/Uyxuc/1/
[13:16:00] <kanzie> man, every time I reload my window my app adds 5mb to the memory-usage of the tab. This memory-leak is serious… is there really no way to identify where it is happening that you guys know of?
[13:39:04] <mansoor-s> kanzie: how do you you its a leak and not just   data, images etc being loaded fom the server to the client?
[13:39:41] <kanzie> mansoor-s: because the only thing loaded from the server is XML, about 200k per 2 seconds.
[13:39:51] <kanzie> everything else is loaded upon startup
[13:40:00] <kanzie> so the app is about 60mb when fully loaded
[13:40:11] <kanzie> and then it starts growing by each ajax-request
[13:40:29] <muhoo> i'm trying to figure out what this does, and failing: https://refheap.com/paste/710
[13:57:52] <jmcantrell> can i get anyone's opinion on this code snippet? http://jsfiddle.net/jmcantrell/8S6CY/5/ I'm fairly new to jquery, so i could use some help spotting red flags
[13:59:37] <rgoodwin> ok another dumb question…
[13:59:48] <rgoodwin> is there any reason why this wouldn't match "days" and change the content
[13:59:48] <rgoodwin>  $('days').replaceWith('<h2>New heading</h2>');
[13:59:57] <rgoodwin> days is the id of a div
[14:00:30] <ajpiano> rgoodwin: $("#days")
[14:00:41] <rgoodwin> holy cow
[14:00:48] <rgoodwin> i thought that was for some other purpose
[14:01:12] <ajpiano> jquery uses css selectors
[14:01:23] <rgoodwin> ok trying, and thanks!
[14:01:27] <ajpiano> # selects an id, something without a prefix selects a name
[14:01:29] <ajpiano> no prob
[14:02:10] <rgoodwin> still not doing it. hrm.
[14:02:13] <ravenzz> he was thinking to something similar to regex selectors i guess
[14:02:16] <rgoodwin> wait, hold please
[14:02:19] <rgoodwin> and yah :)
[14:02:58] <ravenzz> ?demo @ rgoodwin
[14:02:59] <bot-t> rgoodwin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:03:47] <rgoodwin> ravenzz: thanks! I would love to do it, i'm jus tnot sure why my phone gap event isn't firing unless in the emulator; i copied some code samples to try and make it fire
[14:03:50] <rgoodwin> let me see if i can paste it
[14:03:55] <rgoodwin> fiddle it ;)
[14:04:47] <ravenzz> anyway take a look at the jquery selectors documentation page
[14:04:53] <ravenzz> ?selectors
[14:04:54] <bot-t> Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[14:04:56] <simon> I've got a bunch of <td><span class="raw">X</span><span class="weighted">Y</span></td> numbers, and I want a button to alternate between the two numbers. I was going for a $(".raw").css('display: none'); etc., but doesn't that traverse the DOM unnecessarily?
[14:06:05] <OverL> hi, i have a problem, i use ajax, but when i click 1st jquery send 1 responde, when i click 2nd jquery send 2 responde etc,
[14:06:23] <ravenzz> simon you can select the table first, and then use find()
[14:06:43] <c_t_montgomery> OverL can you please make a jsfiddle with your code that you are struggling with?
[14:06:45] <simon> ravenzz, I can't simply change the page-wide CSS classes without traversing?
[14:08:15] <ravenzz> mh sorry my english is not that good, what do you mean with change the page-wide CSS classes?
[14:08:54] <OverL> http://jsfiddle.net/Z5jPU/
[14:10:04] <simon> ravenzz, I mean, the way they appear now is due to settings in a CSS file. if I could just change the properties of those classes that are already assigned, and have the page redraw accordingly, I wouldn't need to explicitly walk through the DOM, I think.
[14:12:20] <ravenzz> yep but you have to select the element which needs to have those new properties
[14:12:24] <ravenzz> anyway
[14:12:39] <simon> oh! I can't just change the class itself?
[14:12:45] <ravenzz> yes you can
[14:12:54] <ravenzz> ?toggleClass @ simon
[14:12:54] <bot-t> simon, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[14:13:48] <ravenzz> OverL seems correct. you could try to add a cache: false
[14:14:06] <OverL> thanks, I try
[14:14:53] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ OverL
[14:14:53] <bot-t> OverL, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[14:15:01] <ravenzz> use this instead of return false;
[14:16:44] <stan_man_can> I have a list of slots, and a list of people to fill the slots up with. The same person can go into multiple slots. I want to be able to "drag" the person from the list of people and have them stay in the list, and have their information ... 'infuse' ... into the slot. If that makes sense? I want the slot to update with their information, but I want the employee to stay in their own list. What jQuery UI should I use? sortable?
[14:16:45] <stan_man_can> dragable/dropable?
[14:18:16] <Ezek2k5> whats the best way to show/hide some divs depending on the id of the button clicked
[14:18:18] <Ezek2k5> or maybe link
[14:18:32] <Ezek2k5> like if i click on button1 link is #page1
[14:18:53] <Ezek2k5> and div with id page-1 will show or someting like that
[14:19:13] <Ezek2k5> i dont wanna use jqueryui tabs cuz its a pain in the ass to fit my style
[14:19:23] <ravenzz> you want to hide the others?
[14:19:40] <Ezek2k5> yes only show the one that is click*
[14:19:43] <Ezek2k5> ed
[14:19:50] <Ezek2k5> i can use anchors
[14:20:04] <ravenzz> you should!
[14:20:07] <ravenzz> hold on
[14:20:11] <Ezek2k5> or if theres another way
[14:20:25] <davidlwatsonjr> stan_man_can: go with drag/drop
[14:20:56] <stan_man_can> davidlwatsonjr: yeah thats what I have so far. curious though, how would I make the draggable stay there. It would need to almost duplicate the element?
[14:21:45] <davidlwatsonjr> so you have two lists, one of employees and one of slots to place those employees?
[14:21:46] <stan_man_can> davidlwatsonjr: helper: clone
[14:21:50] <stan_man_can> yeah
[14:22:06] <stan_man_can> http://schedule.etylogic.com/create/
[14:22:08] <stan_man_can> like such
[14:22:44] <davidlwatsonjr> gotcha, but you want to be able to put john d. (or whoever) in multiple spots
[14:22:57] <OverL> when i use event.preventDefault(); so form is not send
[14:23:39] <davidlwatsonjr> i would clone on drag, then if the clone is dropped somewhere droppable, leave it, otherwise, remove it
[14:24:08] <davidlwatsonjr> that way, when you start draggin john, there's a john still sitting there
[14:24:20] <davidlwatsonjr> then when you drop him on the valid time, he stays there
[14:24:37] <davidlwatsonjr> if you drop him in the ether, poor john clone dies
[14:25:15] <stan_man_can> lol
[14:25:30] <davidlwatsonjr> lol, jokes aside, that what you're looking for?
[14:25:45] <stan_man_can> I need to be able to drop john in multiple slots though. It's for scheduling breaks at work, everybody gets 2 15's and a 30
[14:25:55] <jgornick> hey guys, i'm not losing my mind, but when using 1.7.1 and calling trigger('click.custom', ['data1']), in my handler's event.data, I should see an array with 'data1' in it right?
[14:26:03] <timwis> Afternoon guys
[14:26:23] <davidlwatsonjr> right, well, if you clone john on drag, there's still the original john sitting there, which can be drag/cloned again (and again, and again, etc)
[14:26:28] <timwis> Is there a way to test if a string is 'all caps'? I only want to change the case if it was typed in all-caps
[14:26:42] <stan_man_can> yeah, thats what I'm doing right now so far
[14:26:53] <stan_man_can> now i just need a good way for the droppable element to absorb the information that gets dropped on it
[14:27:31] <davidlwatsonjr> .data ?
[14:27:42] <jgornick> timwis: you could use a regular expression to determine if all characters are caps.
[14:30:46] <ravenzz> Ezek2k5 something like this i guess http://jsfiddle.net/aTNrQ/
[14:31:45] <Ezek2k5> yup that looks good ill try it
[14:31:47] <Ezek2k5> thank you :)
[14:32:22] <OverL> ravenzz, i tried your tip, but still send more request
[14:33:22] <ravenzz> so the issue is that more than one request are sent?
[14:33:24] <jgornick> timwis: Use something like str.match(/[^a-z]/g).length and compare it to the length of the string. If the lengths are the same then the string is all caps.
[14:33:44] <timwis> clever jgornick, thx
[14:33:52] <jgornick> np
[14:33:56] <OverL> yes
[14:35:48] <ravenzz> weird
[14:40:46] <jgornick> Hey guys, am I missing something here but did passing data in trigger just stop working in 1.7.1?
[14:40:58] <jgornick> My event.data property is always undefined.
[14:41:23] <jgornick> Even though I'm using something like el.trigger('eventName', ['value1'])
[14:41:49] <Qalqi> can nyone explain what .load() fn does?
[14:42:09] <Qalqi> i didnt get it by reading jq api
[14:42:50] <OverL> I can solve almost 2 hours, but nothing
[14:57:03] <ribot> does anyone know how to use jstree? i want to get the node text value inside a binding function
[14:59:24] <tomasm-> hi, when I create a $.fn.FUNCNAME, is it passed the list of all items (where i should call each() explicitly), or is there an implicit each() ?
[15:02:14] <ajpiano> the list of items is 'this'
[15:02:35] <ajpiano> you typically do $.fn.funcname = function() { return this.each(function() {} );
[15:02:43] <tomasm-> yeah, thought so
[15:02:44] <tw2113> oh this
[15:04:52] <tomasm-> hmmm, i get each is not defined, from this.each(function () { ... })
[15:08:28] <tomasm-> nevermind, code was wrong
[15:15:47] <sprax> Can someone help me reset the toggle(even,odd) state on an element? I tried .unbind(click).toggle(f1,f2); but it either didn't work or came back into the same state.
[15:43:55] <kanzie> Im trying to figure out a memory-leak that looks like being present in $.jsonp().
[15:44:12] <kanzie> Im polling data every 2 seconds and my app grows by one mb per request almost
[15:45:14] <kanzie> Other than the jsonp Im wondering if the culprit could be that I have click-handlers attached to elements that I re-generate by calling empty() and then append() with the same classes in the DOM. Would this behavior cause detached elements?
[15:49:27] <Ezek2k5> ravenzz ty it did works very well :P ui tabs are 2 hard to stylize :)
[15:51:56] <mrgt> hey guys. looking for an interactive (3d) word cloud - that supports links. I like the look of the one here - http://coda.co.za/blog/ but preferably without the box around the hyperlink (on hover). Anyone know of anything suitable?
[16:15:40] <ChrisPitzer> hey all. How do I load jquery privately?  Ie - i want one of my several scripts to load jquery and have access to it... but I don't want $ available globally.
[16:24:00] <gloomer> ChrisPitzer you would just have to include all of jquery in a local scope
[16:24:50] <ChrisPitzer> gloomer: that's what I want.
[16:24:58] <ChrisPitzer> how do i do that?
[16:27:12] <stan_man_can> when you're in a .each is it possible to find the next value in the loop?
[16:27:44] <stan_man_can> $('#test').each(function(index, val) { $(this).attr("id"); });
[16:28:17] <stan_man_can> so if that spits out the ID of each element #test selects, I'm trying to check the next value
[16:29:27] <gloomer> use index + 1
[16:39:01] <stan_man_can> but how do i refernese it
[16:39:08] <stan_man_can> $(index+1) ??
[16:42:03] <gloomer> no
[16:45:52] <gloomer> $.each(whatever, function(i) { if((i+1) < $('#whatever').size()) { var x = whatever[i+1] }});
[16:46:13] <gloomer> something like that
[16:46:41] <gloomer> or .length
[16:46:42] <gloomer> i forget
[17:12:56] <mr_crunchy> hiii
[17:24:04] <Scott0> anyone good with highcharts?
[18:26:15] <oojacoboo> is there an easy way to wrap a bunch of js on a condition that they exist within a container?
[18:27:03] <oojacoboo> so, if I'm using a main file for a series of pages, each has a unique id, I can specify that to prevent any conflicts
[18:27:32] <oojacoboo> as opposed to including separate files, which in this case is kinda pointless and extra unnecessary work
[18:30:55] <oojacoboo> would you just create a function for each page and then check if the container exists and if so, fire that function?
[18:31:04] <oojacoboo> or the id rathre
[18:32:07] <oojacoboo> if($(selector).exists() {}
[18:32:20] <oojacoboo> thanks #jquery
[19:52:25] <StevenCodes22> sup
[19:53:50] <systemfault> $('And iiiiiIIIIIIIiiii will always love yoouuuuuuuu'); :'(

[20:24:25] <hiryu__> hello
[20:40:29] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, yo.
[20:41:12] <LukeNukem> what does is the this selector for?
[20:41:18] <LukeNukem> like $("this")
[20:56:44] <hiryu__> how i can get datapicker year and month of current calendar with beforeShow event?
[21:14:22] <Liveman> Hey guys, question for you
[21:14:37] <Liveman> I need a way to set the value of an object (in the actual dom source) through jquery
[21:14:49] <Liveman> I tried Attr and while it actually sets the value it's not in the source code.
[21:26:23] <whereswaldo2> Liveman can you show an example of what your trying to do
[21:26:56] <gloomer> Liveman can you show an example of what your trying to do
[21:49:13] <LukeNukem> how can i make a variable id to data-id of a href
[22:29:54] <Wardrop> Can someone explain to me why jQuery.param returns null as the string "null", instead of just an empty string which is I imagine what the vast majority of people would expect?
[22:30:35] <Wardrop> E.g.$.param({name: 'Tony', age: null})
[22:30:38] <Wardrop> The above outputs name=Tony&age=null
[22:30:55] <Wardrop> Wouldn't it much more desirable for it to output: name=Tony&age=
[22:34:00] <bobsomebody> hello #jquery
[22:39:58] <Wardrop> Hmm, it seems jQuery uses the built-in function encodeURIComponent() to convert types to URL-encoded strings. It's probably a fault on jQuery's behalf for not dealing with the data appropriately before handing it off to encodeURIComponent()
[23:38:01] <meghdad> anyone know a map widget?
[23:38:08] <meghdad> a map picker to be exact
[23:52:14] <LukeNukem> Google maps?
[23:53:22] <Mehrdad> LukeNukem, i think i found it
[23:53:26] <Mehrdad> map query it is
[23:53:32] <Mehrdad> just need to edit it
[23:53:34] <LukeNukem> nice
[23:54:12] <Mehrdad> LukeNukem, wrong guy :) i suck at jq
[23:54:33] <LukeNukem> me too
[23:54:35] <LukeNukem> :P
[23:54:49] <Mehrdad> but do tell, i could give you a hint or something
