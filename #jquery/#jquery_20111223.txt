[00:00:14] <LordThumper> yeah same :)
[00:00:26] <hrwath> and you're from...?
[00:00:34] <dismist> therefore in comparison to the sack and tip, a one equal sign weiner might be representative of a rather small penis, or one with a very large head and balls
[00:00:42] <LordThumper> Malta, you?

[00:01:01] <LordThumper> Ah nice :) Is it cold there? Cause it is fkin freezing here
[00:01:07] <hrwath> -5*C
[00:01:11] <LordThumper> ouch
[00:01:18] <destryalhmns> i just noticed that your penis growing algorithm would result in an infinite loop
[00:01:21] <hrwath> and snow everywhere :)
[00:01:26] <LordThumper> ah no snow here
[00:01:33] <LordThumper> Never snowed in the last 100 years
[00:01:38] <hrwath> lucky you
[00:01:44] <destryalhmns> thereby creating an infinite penis that would fill the entire universe
[00:02:11] <LordThumper> yeah but it gets really cold sometimes, and it rains alot
[00:02:11] <hrwath> LordThumper, well, snow is okay, unless you're dealing with a car
[00:02:19] <LordThumper> fair enough
[00:02:26] <hrwath> oh better snow than rain
[00:02:55] <destryalhmns> a better penis growing algorith would be
[00:02:58] <hrwath> hm
[00:02:59] * destryalhmns waits to be booted
[00:03:16] <LordThumper> lol destry
[00:03:17] <hrwath> LordThumper, so, you make rainmen instead of snowmen? :D
[00:03:29] <LordThumper> hehe
[00:03:52] <LordThumper> nah watermen

[00:15:11] <krz> how can i check if object is nil?
[00:15:34] <dismist> if undefined or if null or if .length=0
[00:15:44] <dismist> well the .length i dont know about, i think it works for objects
[00:19:22] <pulse00> hi all. anyone knows if using $('#idOfSelect').val(100) should work for selection a specific option of a select element by value in jquery 1.7?
[00:19:36] <dismist> i would do
[00:19:44] <gloomer> yes it will
[00:19:54] <dismist> $('select option eq:100').val()
[00:20:09] <dismist> for backwards compatibility
[00:20:43] <pulse00> i see, thanks.
[00:22:17] <pulse00> it shouldn't matter if the select element is hidden or not i guess
[00:41:16] <krz> how can i check if object is nil?
[00:42:33] <dismist> krz: did you try allegedobject.length ?
[00:42:44] <krz> yea
[00:42:56] <krz> data.likeable is undefined
[00:42:56] <krz> else if (data.likeable.length == 1) {
[00:53:47] <demorose> hi
[00:55:17] <demorose> Does someone know if  " ($("#content").is(":empty")) " return true if div with id="content" does not exist?
[01:02:34] <shesek> demorose, isn't it easier to just test it?
[01:02:47] <orkz> demorose, http://jsfiddle.net/2hSvj/
[01:03:56] <demorose> orkz: thanks!
[01:11:18] <enerel> is there a jquery youtube video rotator?
[01:13:33] <demorose> enerel : http://radixdvd.com/video-lightbox/jquery-video-rotator.html
[01:18:27] <enerel> demorose: i wanted to rotate my videos like this http://cdn1.1stwebdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/jquery-gallery-solutions/rotator-gallery-jquery-image-slideshow-tools-free.jpg
[01:18:49] <enerel> but this plugin seems no longer available
[01:30:04] <woozly> how to change content of draggable item? (which picked and moved)
[01:44:12] <mazzachre> Is it possible somehow to make the .css('fontSize') function return in em or % or other than px? or is it always stored in px when it gets in the system?
[01:45:16] <SPYGAME> hey guys, i'm have this code http://pastie.org/3061572 which works absolutely fine with FF all versions and Chrome and IE 9, but not in IE 8 ? please let me know what is the issue ?
[01:45:35] <Jee5us_work> mazzachre, it always returns the font size in px, even when it has been set in em or %
[01:46:07] <Jee5us_work> mazzachre, but there is a way i think. There is a plugin for that
[01:46:50] <Jee5us_work> mazzachre, https://github.com/filamentgroup/jQuery-Pixel-Em-Converter
[01:48:31] <Jee5us_work> SPYGAME, do u have a working page that I can test and debug?
[01:49:18] <mazzachre> Then question number 2... does it matter :) I am making a designer thingie for an app, and the customer wants to select a font (among other things) Normally I use em (for compatibility) but should I just put it up in px?
[01:53:43] <mazzachre> How do I set the context in which to run a function?
[01:54:16] <Jee5us_work> U can use just px. It's all ok.
[01:54:56] <mazzachre> I have a dialog, with an "OK" button, this OK button should change an option in my widget (dialog owned and created by the widget)
[01:55:22] <mazzachre> How can I make the OK function run in the widget context (with this as the actual widget)
[01:55:26] <Jee5us_work> u mean like a confirm box?
[01:55:43] <Jee5us_work> "Do u want to run this function?" Ok / Cancel
[01:55:48] <Jee5us_work> and OK should trigger the function?
[01:57:00] <Jee5us_work> mazzachre?
[01:57:01] <mazzachre> Not really... It is an options window
[01:57:06] <Jee5us_work> Ow
[01:57:13] <Jee5us_work> Custom?
[01:58:07] <mazzachre> I have a number of options for the widget, custom stuff, and I want the "OK" button to basically call (the-actual-widget-there-might-be-more)._setOption('key', 'value');
[01:59:07] <mazzachre> It is a font selector for the designer... So I have some input fields that should contain the css for the font... I then have this widget as frontend to edit the css for people who don't know what css is...
[02:00:39] <mazzachre> So the input field contains "bold 21px Times New Roman,Times,serif" but it is hidden, I have a button to take it's place, that is styled "wysiwyg" with the font selected.. And clicking the button opens a dialog with a family selector, size selector, style/weight/variant selectors etc...
[02:01:02] <mazzachre> I have it all up and working now... Only the OK button eludes me...
[02:04:01] <SPYGAME> Jee5us_work: no i don't have it right now, it requires authentication
[02:07:03] <Jee5us_work> SPYGAME, therefore debuging it it kinda impossible :)
[02:13:45] <woozly> how to disable text selecting? (I create div-button) but if I quick and often click on it... some space under button selects :o(
[02:15:35] <woozly> thanks. ive done
[02:18:51] <ksz> hi, I've got this code: http://jsfiddle.net/tsbXa/ I'd like to trigger my event only when I click on the li with the .submenu class, not when I click on one of them child
[02:28:19] <GoSox> so i have me a .slideDown('slow');
[02:28:26] <GoSox> but it always slides down instantly
[02:29:12] <orkz> ksz, http://jsfiddle.net/tsbXa/4/
[02:29:53] <xec> haha orkz, i had that exact same code, was about to post
[02:30:09] <ksz> orkz: ahah, I forget I add styled my a with display: block ^^
[02:30:12] <orkz> :P
[02:30:29] <ksz> that's why I wanted to add the event on the li, what a nap
[02:31:43] <xec> ksz: if you need to bind to the li you would need to prevent bubbling on the nested list(s)
[02:33:46] <ksz> xec: how can I do that?
[02:35:40] <xec> ksz: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/tsbXa/5/
[02:36:38] <xec> now it will follow the links
[02:40:04] <enerel> when assining link of iframe with this code $(".vid").attr('src',link); i get Permission denied to access property 'toString' in firebug. why?
[02:40:12] <enerel> when assining link of iframe with this code $(".vid").attr('src',link); i get Permission denied to access property 'toString' in firebug. why?
[02:41:09] <ksz> xec: oh, nice. Thanks!
[02:41:20] <enerel> why tnx?
[02:41:52] <GoSox> i can't figure out why one div can be .slideDown('slow') and the other one goes instantly. YOu can see it if you submit this form without entering any data: http://www.whatsmyip.org/text-to-code-ratio/
[02:44:19] <GoSox> thats funny, now it's working
[02:44:30] <GoSox> although, now it goes way too far, then snaps back?
[02:48:11] <coderDJ412> good morning
[02:50:22] <mj23> Hi Guy. I'm having troubles with the jQuery validator plugin. I'm using errorPlacement: function (error, element) {} to add custom css to a div which surrounds my elements which is working fine. But the problem is that when the field is validated successfully i can't remove the css. Is there something which i can set which get's called on each element and test if that element is valid or is there something else i can do? Stuck and time pressur
[02:50:30] <mattyh88> hi how could i remove one option from a selectbox?
[02:50:39] <mj23> Guys!
[02:50:40] <mj23> lol
[02:50:49] <nveid> sup
[02:51:00] <mattyh88> trying something with $("#select").find('option').remove() .. but don't know what to put in "find"
[02:51:37] <nveid> I generally just change the whole area inside the select
[02:51:52] <nveid> Know that isn't much help
[02:51:57] <mattyh88> ah nmv, found it :)
[02:54:00] <mattyh88> $("#type option[value='S']").remove(); isn't working, no errors or anything
[02:54:10] <mattyh88> the option with value S is still there
[02:56:36] <sandy1986> Hi ;)
[02:58:01] <sandy1986> having problems sending JSON request (HTTP Post)... request: ("name=Sandy")  recieved, not { name: "Sandy" }
[02:58:32] <quicksilver> mattyh88: works fine here : http://jsfiddle.net/v6fTQ/
[02:58:39] <quicksilver> mattyh88: I expect your selector is wrong.
[03:03:52] <mazzachre> Is is possible, via the css() function to add the same functionality as :hover in css? Or must I add mouseenter, mouseout event handlers?
[03:04:13] <mazzachre> s/out/leave/
[03:04:43] <GoSox> so i have a situation where i load the result of a form into a div, and slide that div down. It's sliding way to far then snapping back. What causes that? I use the same technique on countless other pages and none of them have that problem
[03:04:52] <nFFF> mazzachre, whats the situation
[03:04:58] <mattyh88> quicksilver: ohh righhht ... found it haha ... dumb mistake
[03:04:59] <nFFF> What are you trying to acheive
[03:06:48] <lauxley> hey, any way to unset an ajaxForm ?
[03:07:39] <lauxley> i have a preview button that call ajaxForm, but i want the real submot button to switch back the form to normal
[03:07:43] <lauxley> submit*
[03:08:18] <ravenzz> unbind the submit
[03:08:27] <mazzachre> nFFF: I am adding some html via javascript, and I would like a hover functionality... Basically it is a dynamic list <ul> with some <li>s inside, I would like to change the background color of the li under the curser...
[03:08:30] <mazzachre> cursor
[03:09:04] <mazzachre> nFFF: I could add a class, I know, but then I might clash with something... Or should I just ignore that?
[03:09:14] <lauxley> ravenzz: if i unbind the submit, the form won't work anymore
[03:09:25] <nFFF> mazzachre, I would just add a class
[03:09:28] <lauxley> nevermind, ill look directly into the lib
[03:11:23] <lauxley> ravenzz: ok there is an unbind method, i guess you were refering to it
[03:11:56] <nFFF> mazzachre, just use jQuery hover(), .addClass()
[03:12:13] <ravenzz> lauxley yes
[03:12:30] <lauxley> and its working
[03:13:17] <mazzachre> nFFF: I have done it simpler... I add a class to the actual list and let the user define css for it (and the class is in options for the widget) that should be doable...
[03:14:04] <WalterTamboer> hi
[03:14:48] <GoSox> so anyone know anything about this slideDown too far and snap back issue?
[03:15:51] <nFFF> mazzachre, not sure what your doing so can't comment, if you're trying to change the color of a <li> element on hover $("li").hover(function(){ $(this).addClass('hovered'); }); is the easiest i know
[03:29:31] <GoSox> goddamnit
[03:29:39] <GoSox> i've never had this problem before and now nothing i do will fix it
[03:30:12] * GoSox feels like bill o'riely from that inside edition video

[04:00:05] <mazzachre> Where to store private variables in jquery.ui.widget?
[04:02:31] <mazzachre> When I make my own widget, can I somehow store private vars for each specific object? If I include an object for this in the prototype object given to the widget command, the last instantiation overwrites the other ones references, so that does not work... (I guess I am far too used to oo and not javscript :s)

[05:04:42] <damd> hi.  i'm trying to use "html5 boilerplate" for my new project, but i'm having trouble understanding how to use jquery with it.  i have "$(function () ..." in my HTML, but whenever i use that, i get $ is not defined, probably because jquery has yet to load.  how do i know when jquery has loaded?
[05:04:48] <daGrevis> How to make it in $_POST?
[05:04:52] <daGrevis> at PHP-side
[05:05:29] <vainoharhainen> daGrevis: you asking me?
[05:06:18] <vainoharhainen> daGrevis: i will make it php side now, bc i dont know anyway to do it with just uploadify + jq.
[05:06:19] <daGrevis> vainoharhainen, im asking anyone who can answer :)
[05:06:30] <vainoharhainen> aha lol.
[05:06:42] <vainoharhainen> daGrevis: i recomend you to write this in your php code.
[05:07:20] <vainoharhainen> print_r($_POST);
[05:07:21] <daGrevis> just shut-up :)
[05:07:41] <vainoharhainen> Then you se how all data will be passed.
[05:07:53] <vainoharhainen> gtfo then.

[05:16:19] <m3t4> Hi, http://jsfiddle.net/xpdam/  this function removing item from list, then item removing i want use toggle efect, but then using toggling all my items, how can do toggle only one item ?
[05:16:54] <BinaryKitten> lets take a looksee m3t4
[05:17:53] <BinaryKitten> m3t4 i see what you're doing there
[05:19:48] <BinaryKitten> ok m3t4
[05:20:01] <BinaryKitten> which "item" are you wanting to toggle
[05:20:57] <m3t4> only one from list
[05:21:16] <BinaryKitten> yes
[05:21:26] <BinaryKitten> but i can't help you without more detail on that 1 item
[05:21:38] <BinaryKitten> how will you know which item is the right one in the list?
[05:23:01] <m3t4> then someone click link and id send to function
[05:23:08] <vainoharhainen> m3t4: ("ul li").toggle(); ?
[05:23:11] <m3t4> onclick="removeProduct(<?php echo $id; ?>);"
[05:23:19] <vainoharhainen> not seen your html code
[05:23:33] <BinaryKitten> m3t4 that doesn't help
[05:23:47] <BinaryKitten> the id is a product id
[05:23:50] <BinaryKitten> not a element ID
[05:23:57] <BinaryKitten> unless they are somehow tied
[05:24:42] <m3t4> product is in the div <div class="right_row">1product</div>
[05:24:43] <BinaryKitten> we're missing the vital piece of information that links the item in the list and what you have already.
[05:25:05] <BinaryKitten> ok.. so how can we determine which in the list is the right one?
[05:26:56] <BinaryKitten> m3t4 you're not giving us much to work with here... can't help you until you do
[05:28:26] <m3t4> d, little bit harder say how i want to do :))

[05:35:25] <Spike_Manana> Hi, how do I refer only to elements child <ul>, but not all <ul>'s inside that element? Thank you.
[05:36:47] <destryalhmns> .children()?
[05:38:03] <RLa> damd, put your scripts at the bottom after jquery
[05:38:37] <damd> RLa: as i thought then... thanks
[05:40:40] <RLa> damd, and use (function($) { use $ here })(jQuery); that allows $ to be used by other frameworks
[05:41:22] <RLa> some things like wordpress ban global $
[05:41:54] <damd> RLa: i usually do that, but it's not a problem in the current application :)
[05:44:53] <destryalhmns> so ive been asking this a lot but
[05:45:03] <destryalhmns> anyone really knowleadgable about building mobile apps?
[05:45:09] <destryalhmns> er
[05:45:23] <destryalhmns> web based apps used on tablets to be more specific
[05:45:40] <destryalhmns> like with jquery mobile
[05:58:47] <tcurdt> I have this very simple page https://gist.github.com/bf32a88554be3fb89046 and somehow width() is not returning the expected width. Anyone a clue what's wrong there?
[06:00:25] <Eviltwin> Well what do you expect and what are you getting?
[06:01:13] <Eviltwin> And can you put this in a jsFiddle instead so we can actually see
[06:01:21] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/HnimCNn1
[06:01:53] <Sean-Der> For some reason every button on the page is firing a 'This is our service'?
[06:02:14] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/zuBVBiy6
[06:02:15] <tcurdt> Eviltwin: jsFiddle it is .. just a sec
[06:02:20] <Sean-Der> Sorry I messed up that paste really bad
[06:03:31] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: Two solutions
[06:03:46] <Eviltwin> Well first
[06:03:46] <Sean-Der> Yes?
[06:03:49] <Sean-Der> Sorry
[06:03:54] <Eviltwin> The problem is that you're looping with the var X
[06:04:10] <Eviltwin> In this scope
[06:04:26] <Eviltwin> And there's only one X
[06:04:41] <Eviltwin> After the loop finishes, its set to "Service"
[06:05:00] <Eviltwin> Well, it's set to 5 which means prodCats[X] is going to be "Service"
[06:05:26] <Eviltwin> First solution is to use an anonymous function to create a new scope for it
[06:05:34] <Eviltwin> Second solution is to use a $.each which basically does that for you
[06:05:55] <Eviltwin> I'm going to suggest the $.each because you are actually only interested in prodCats[X] anyway
[06:06:14] <Sean-Der> Ok I understand the convention of $.self
[06:06:33] <Sean-Der> I used it to remove self and so on, but I am lost to how we are going to exactly use it here?
[06:07:16] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: http://pastebin.com/NKsgXqSA
[06:07:37] <Eviltwin> Try that
[06:08:12] <tcurdt> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/7QzrL/
[06:08:42] <Sean-Der> You rock Eviltwin!~
[06:08:46] <tcurdt> Eviltwin: I would expect the width to be 5*300px
[06:08:57] <Sean-Der> I can expand on this to do alot of other work down the line also
[06:09:07] <Eviltwin> tcurdt: Do you have Firebug or the WebKit Developer Tools?
[06:09:11] <tcurdt> yup
[06:09:21] <Eviltwin> Go inspect the OL
[06:09:36] <Eviltwin> You'll see it's actually the width jQuery reports
[06:10:28] <Sean-Der> So for each indicie in prodCats it is performing the function. I don't get what the I is doing or why exactly the V is working.
[06:10:37] <Sean-Der> What would I search in jQuery API to learn it
[06:10:57] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: see ?.each
[06:10:58] <tcurdt> Eviltwin: Hm. Indeed. Not that I would understand why though
[06:10:58] <bot-t> Sean-Der, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[06:12:11] <Eviltwin> tcurdt: It's definitely a CSS issue, not a jQuery issue
[06:12:17] <Eviltwin> You can poke the people in #css
[06:12:21] <tcurdt> k
[06:12:23] <tcurdt> thanks!
[06:13:29] <Sean-Der> Thanks for the help Eviltwin. It is like foreach on steroids
[06:14:53] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: Kind of and because there's the function() {} in there, it means copies of the indices and values get made
[06:15:02] <Eviltwin> So you don't have the issue you were having earlier
[06:15:11] <Eviltwin> Where X was always pointing to 5
[06:15:47] <Sean-Der> Thanks for your help! I need to start using the actual power of jQuery and stop looking for plain ECMAscript answers
[06:16:32] <Eviltwin> Instead of for(var x in list) { ... } you could do for(var x in list) (function(i,v) { ... })(x,list[x]);
[06:16:41] <Eviltwin> And that would do pretty much exactly the same thing from your perspective
[06:16:51] <Eviltwin> And show you a little about how it actually works
[06:17:14] <Eviltwin> Self-executing functions!
[06:17:16] <Eviltwin> Yay!
[06:19:26] <Sean-Der> Doesn't get more fun than that :D
[06:20:05] <held> any one know how I can submit a form when a radio button is selected? no need for an ajax request or anything
[06:20:11] <held> i just don't want to show a submit button
[06:20:47] <Eviltwin> $("{selector for radio button}").click(function(){$("{selector for form}").submit()});
[06:21:42] <GoSox> if i want the length of the text in an input, is it $("#url_box").length or $("#url_box").val().length
[06:21:45] <GoSox> or something else
[06:22:02] <Eviltwin> Latter
[06:22:31] <Eviltwin> Do you know what the first one does?
[06:23:04] <GoSox> obviously not based on me just asking if it did something that it doesn't do
[06:23:25] <Eviltwin> It tells you the number of things matched by that selector
[06:23:37] <GoSox> oh
[06:23:40] <GoSox> interesting
[06:42:16] <woozly> how to rebind all event listeners? (after adding new element, which must have listener.. `click` for example) ?
[06:43:04] <Eviltwin> You can't
[06:43:18] <Eviltwin> What you want to do is see ?.delegate
[06:43:18] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:43:40] <Eviltwin> Or .on in 1.7+
[06:45:25] <Sean-Der> What is the correct way to append information from an external page? I have used load before, but that may not be the most standard way?
[06:46:28] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to replace the (HTML) content of a element with the (HTML) content of some other URI, then .load is the way to go
[06:47:10] <woozly> how to exit up to parent of parent of parent? 3 times '.parent()' ?
[06:47:10] <atriv> Hi, I'm having trouble selecting an item that i added live to the DOM. I know i can use .live() to bind to an event. but what if i want to just select... to do a hide or fadeout etc
[06:47:37] <quicksilver> there should be no problem selecting an element which has been added to the DOM
[06:47:42] <quicksilver> all selectors should work as normal
[06:47:54] <quicksilver> you didn't try to add something with an ID which already exists elsewhere did you?
[06:48:18] <Eviltwin> woozly: If you specifically want the parent's parent's parent, use .parent().parent().parent()
[06:48:34] <Eviltwin> woozly: The reason the syntax is so long is generally that's not the right approach
[06:48:38] <Eviltwin> woozly: see ?.closest
[06:48:39] <bot-t> woozly, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:48:57] <Eviltwin> atriv: Don't use .live, use .on or .delegate
[06:49:16] <atriv> ok, thank you
[06:50:55] <atriv> i found the issue...i was initializing the popover function i wanted to implement before the element existed. changed to init on add and it works like a charm
[06:52:22] <Sean-Der> Eviltwin, What is the proper way to append then? Or am I better off appending a span as a holder and using load to fill it?
[06:52:53] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: $.get("/page/goes/here",function(data){$("{target}").append(data)});
[06:54:23] <B-lue> Hey all.. I'm trying to find something for load-on-scroll, but to work with div's. I need something like - http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload - but for anything within div's, and not just for images..
[06:55:22] <B-lue> it looks like maybe that script could be changed easily, but iunno
[06:55:53] <Eviltwin> So waht are you lazy loading exactly?
[06:56:04] <B-lue> just text/pics
[06:56:23] <B-lue> basically a long long journal with the first div being the most recent journal entry
[06:56:51] <B-lue> so I figured I could start with div id="999999999999999999999999" and just decrease by 1 number to get it to be the most recent.
[06:57:09] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[06:57:15] <Eviltwin> Well that aside
[06:57:26] <woozly> thank you guys! bye!!
[06:57:27] <Eviltwin> There's not really a great reason to dynamically load text
[06:57:41] <B-lue> well it will be both text/pictures
[06:58:43] <Eviltwin> Then just lazy load the pictures
[06:58:54] <rintaun> if i parse some arbitrary html (e.g. <div><img src="whatever.jpg"></div>) like $(html)... is there a way to tell when it's fully loaded?
[06:59:19] <Eviltwin> rintaun: It's not going to load until it's added to the DOM
[06:59:31] <Eviltwin> And you're going to want to listen to load events on the relevant elements
[07:00:35] <rintaun> ok, it's fine if it doesn't load until added to the dom... but there's no way to have like, the div fire a load event when all the relevent elements within it have loaded? :/
[07:04:13] <B-lue> Eviltwin: that does make sense, but is there a way to make it load whole div's as scrolled? both pictures/text? basically I want a posts page with like heading being the date, and then I plan to write paragraphs, or w/e of text with pictures in the paragraph, but I don't want 2 year old text loading for no reason unless its scrolled down to
[07:06:37] <Eviltwin> B-lue: You're going to be listening to the window scroll event and checking the body scrollTop & window height against the body height
[07:08:23] <andrew9183> is this like lazy loading ?
[07:08:25] <B-lue> I mean like it could auto load the first 2-3 div's, but then load 2-3 more as scrolled down.. I figured there would be a way to do it with id's, or something so div #999999999999999999 would be last, and #999999999999999998 above it, and so forth...
[07:08:26] <B-lue> yes
[07:08:56] <B-lue> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload - but i want it for whole div's text & pics..
[07:14:20] <Eviltwin> blackspotwiggins: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/uwYW7/
[07:15:15] <meesebyte> hey – trying to get img#mc, when resizing from scaleUp jquery, to float to bottom of #mc and stay there. (I want it to pulse up and left) Dunno, maybe I need to tweak my script to do that: http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/ZCt5n/77/
[07:18:01] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZCt5n/78/
[07:18:02] <Eviltwin> Or what
[07:18:15] <Eviltwin> Oh, wait
[07:19:36] <Arun_> hello
[07:19:56] <meesebyte> (it cycles images btw)
[07:20:11] <Arun_> can anyone help me with a little problem ?
[07:20:23] <Arun_> can anyone help me with a little problem ?
[07:20:25] <BinaryKitten> ?peace @ Arun_
[07:20:26] <bot-t> Arun_, please Pastebin: Expected result, Actual result, all (relevant) Code, any Errors/Exceptions - This is *not* a multiple-choice request, we need all of them
[07:20:54] <BinaryKitten> also Arun_  give us the issue you're having.. don't just fish for "someone to help"
[07:21:08] <Arun_> $('img', preview); what does this mean with preview being any variable
[07:21:43] <BinaryKitten> it means find an img tag inside the preview
[07:21:57] <BinaryKitten> eg var preview = $('#preview');
[07:22:03] <Arun_> oh.. thank you, got it =)
[07:22:10] <BinaryKitten> np
[07:22:14] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: More like this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZCt5n/79/
[07:22:20] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: This is really more of a CSS thing
[07:22:23] <Eviltwin> Hit up the folks in #css
[07:22:37] <Eviltwin> Arun_: $('img', preview) basically means $(preview).find('img')
[07:22:49] <Eviltwin> Arun_: In other words all IMGs inside the element preview
[07:22:57] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, BinaryKitten got you
[07:23:00] <meesebyte> yes, ty eviltwin :D
[07:23:18] * BinaryKitten hi5s Eviltwin
[07:23:26] <meesebyte> derp, work eviltwin that was simple
[07:23:30] <meesebyte> derpity derp
[07:23:31] <meesebyte> thanks
[07:23:39] <Arun_> so, we can do it another way : preview.find('img'); ? isn't this the same ?
[07:23:39] <meesebyte> work->wow
[07:23:52] <quicksilver> Arun_: yes. I prefer that personally.
[07:24:09] <Arun_> oh, great :)
[07:24:10] <fris> can you do a find img with hover?
[07:24:14] <Eviltwin> It depends on if preview is already a jQuery collection
[07:24:19] <Arun_> yeah...
[07:24:27] <Arun_> its already selected through jQuery
[07:24:35] <fris> trying to implment something like that on here http://pastebin.com/4f4YHUCZ line 46
[07:24:35] <Eviltwin> fris: I don't undertand the quesiton
[07:24:40] <Eviltwin> Arun_: Then yeah, you can do that
[07:24:42] <Eviltwin> And it's actually faster
[07:24:50] <Arun_> oh k
[07:25:18] <Eviltwin> fris: So do that...?
[07:25:32] <BinaryKitten> Eviltwin is it actually faster?
[07:25:55] <BinaryKitten> i thought if the 2nd param is a jquery object, it internally just maps to .find
[07:25:57] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: $("img", preview) actually runs $(preview).find("img") inside
[07:26:09] <Eviltwin> So there's the extra time of the function call to $()
[07:26:23] <BinaryKitten> which isn't that much slower
[07:26:26] <Eviltwin> You can't just "map" a function that doesn't have the same signature
[07:26:36] <quicksilver> this is not really something to waste time thinking about unless you do that 1000s of times per second
[07:26:41] <Eviltwin> No matter what it takes more time to do another function call
[07:26:50] <BinaryKitten> meh agreed
[07:26:56] <BinaryKitten> but minutia
[07:27:03] <BinaryKitten> still can't really argue
[07:27:09] <BinaryKitten> nCurses
[07:27:16] <quicksilver> and probably if you are selecting 1000s of times per second you could find a different approach
[07:27:35] <B-lue> ah freak it.. ill just do the whole jquery lazy load thing with the images...
[07:27:53] * BinaryKitten returns to drinking Tea and watching Tv
[07:27:54] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: It's about 5% faster to use the .find
[07:28:11] <BinaryKitten> urm..
[07:28:12] <mouse-_> 1;2c/sb end
[07:28:18] <Eviltwin> For small selectors
[07:28:22] <BinaryKitten> over what Eviltwin?
[07:28:37] <Eviltwin> $("#foo").find("img") over $("img","#foo")
[07:28:45] <BinaryKitten> yes of course
[07:29:07] <BinaryKitten> but not over $('img', $foo); where $foo was preselected earlier
[07:30:09] <Arun_> I just started learning jQuery, my another question is :- if we select an element through jQuery and store it in a variable like : var newOne = $('div.preview'); preview being the class.. then, in order to use the same variable again, do we need to just use newOne or $(newOne) ? are they both the same ?
[07:30:15] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: Why do you think that?
[07:30:25] <quicksilver> and even if that 5% is true, it's quite irrelevant unless you do so many selections like that that is actually a bottleneck. Which would be a very unusual piece of javascript.
[07:30:40] <quicksilver> Arun_: just newOne is fine.
[07:30:51] <quicksilver> Arun_: $(newOne) will end up being the same thing.
[07:30:58] <BinaryKitten> because in the $('img', '#foo') case Eviltwin  it searches for all images, then filters those based on the parent
[07:30:58] <Arun_> k, and if we write $(newOne), there isn't any problem, right ?
[07:31:04] <Arun_> i'll prefer the first one then =)
[07:31:08] <meesebyte> eviltwin: well I just realized I meant for it to be centered and bottom-floated (Either that or centered vertically as well as horizontally). Do you think that is more suitable for #css?
[07:31:18] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Yes
[07:31:21] <BinaryKitten> whereas the one with the jquery object.. it just calls through to .find
[07:31:29] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: http://jsperf.com/context-vs-find-3
[07:32:19] <Eviltwin> You know that all jQuery selectors are processed right to left, right?
[07:32:32] <Arun_> k, thnx Eviltwin and BinaryKitten =) will come again with doubts :P cya
[07:32:38] <Eviltwin> It builds the rightmost collection first and then filters down
[07:32:51] <Eviltwin> The only exception being if the first thing is an ID
[07:33:05] <Eviltwin> In which case it goes directly to that element first and then starts at the right within that context
[07:33:42] <BinaryKitten> Eviltwin according to the graph
[07:33:53] <BinaryKitten> Chrome is pretty much head to head on those
[07:34:38] <BinaryKitten> the rightmost thing only applies to a single selector
[07:34:40] <Eviltwin> I still see 8% slower for the first
[07:34:42] <BinaryKitten> not todual
[07:36:04] <meesebyte> eviltwin: okay, so I was able to figure it out, but the animation is not liking what's going on I guess. It'd all shaky when pulsing: http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/ZCt5n/86/
[07:36:11] <Eviltwin> For anything of the form $("{selector}", context), it internally runs context.find("{selector}")
[07:36:12] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[07:36:15] <meesebyte> it's*
[07:36:19] <Eviltwin> So I'm not seeing how it could possibly be faster to use the first syntax
[07:36:34] <BinaryKitten> not saying it's faster Eviltwin
[07:36:37] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Then use CSS3 animations or something
[07:37:19] <BinaryKitten> just saying that it doesn't matter, it's not that much of a slow down (unless as quicksilver rightly said) you're doing it a loop or some other stuff which should be sorted 1st
[07:38:14] <globe_tmp> guys coul any one help me witht this processing ; i got a datatable and i want to loop over 2 columns and compare their values  http://pastie.org/3062852   SAME table i mean
[07:38:50] <Eviltwin> globe_tmp: You mean you have a <table>?
[07:39:08] <globe_tmp> Eviltwin:  yeah table sorry :d
[07:39:14] <globe_tmp> datatable is in JSF ...
[07:39:52] <Eviltwin> And you're looking at each div in the 3rd and 4th columns?
[07:40:12] <globe_tmp> Eviltwin: yeah the value is contained inside the div
[07:40:20] <Eviltwin> Okay
[07:40:49] <Eviltwin> globe_tmp: Instead of jQuery(rowsDonneeRessourceCompList)
[07:40:59] <Eviltwin> You want jQuery(this)
[07:41:10] <Eviltwin> For both of the places you have that
[07:41:25] <globe_tmp> Eviltwin:  it work on the first this afection  but when i put it in the second
[07:41:34] <globe_tmp> fatguylaughing: it didn't loop on the second column
[07:41:41] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, I lied
[07:41:50] <Eviltwin> Right before var col1 =
[07:41:57] <Eviltwin> You want var row = this;
[07:42:00] <fatguylaughing> … that's nice? :)
[07:42:01] <Eviltwin> Or better yet
[07:42:05] <Eviltwin> var row = $(this);
[07:42:09] <Eviltwin> Then row.children(...
[07:42:17] <Eviltwin> And row.children(...
[07:42:25] <Eviltwin> That should solve your problem
[07:42:29] <fatguylaughing> globe_tmp: Got tab friendly aye?
[07:42:39] <Arun_> event.target points to the element which fired the event ?
[07:42:52] <Eviltwin> Arun_: Effectively, e
[07:42:52] <Eviltwin> yes*
[07:42:53] <globe_tmp> fatguylaughing: didn't get what yu mean
[07:43:02] <meesebyte> eviltwin: I want to try one last thing. How would I make this set background-image as on of my random images and animate background image?
[07:43:12] <meesebyte> that would be easy to float
[07:43:14] <fatguylaughing> globe_tmp: You ping me up above I imagine you were talking to Eviltwin not me :)
[07:43:18] <meesebyte>  http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/ZCt5n/86/
[07:43:31] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: You can't animate background-image(s) well AFAIK
[07:43:41] <meesebyte> uh, oh
[07:43:45] <meesebyte> thought ya could
[07:43:46] <globe_tmp> fatguylaughing: sorry i'm using webchat , i apology :d
[07:43:51] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Not well
[07:44:00] <fatguylaughing> globe_tmp: No worries :)
[07:44:16] <meesebyte> I guess css3 is the way for this 'un
[07:44:30] <fatguylaughing> globe_tmp: Hope you figure out what you need
[07:44:47] <Eviltwin> Consider every animation done in JavaScript basically a hack
[07:44:58] <globe_tmp> fatguylaughing: yeap
[07:45:08] <globe_tmp> Eviltwin: thanks a lot
[07:45:08] <Eviltwin> Trying to make the user think its growing and shrinking
[07:45:19] <Eviltwin> But really it's a cheat
[07:45:29] <Eviltwin> Changing the size as many times per second as it can
[07:45:33] <Eviltwin> And sometimes it can't keep up
[07:45:44] <Eviltwin> CSS3 animations don't have that problem
[07:45:50] <Eviltwin> Or at least never nearly as bad
[07:46:14] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: Didn't know that
[07:46:50] <Arun_> suppose, if an element <p>Something</p> fired the event then event.target.nodeName will give us "p" ?
[07:47:06] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: One other thing to consider is that all JavaScript runs significantly crappier if you have a script debugger running
[07:47:12] <globe_tmp> Eviltwin: http://pastie.org/3062899  yu mean that right .?
[07:47:24] <Eviltwin> Arun_: "P" actually
[07:47:43] <Eviltwin> globe_tmp: var col1 = row.children
[07:47:48] <Eviltwin> var col2 = row.children
[07:47:51] <Arun_> oh.. then, everything this in uppercase ?
[07:47:54] <Eviltwin> No need for the extra jQuery() there
[07:47:55] <Eviltwin> Arun_: Yes
[07:47:59] <Eviltwin> For the nodeNames
[07:47:59] <Arun_> oh
[07:48:04] <Eviltwin> To standardize
[07:48:13] <Arun_> and classNames ? they too uppercase ?
[07:48:23] <Eviltwin> No, they're whatever case you made them
[07:48:36] <Eviltwin> 'Cause IIRC foobar and fooBar are different classes
[07:49:15] <Arun_> suppose, <p class="Hire">Something</p> fired the event then event.target.className will give us "Hire" ?
[07:49:33] <meesebyte> eviltwin: I bet, but apparently this resizing visual "laggy" type animation is a common phenomenon that has to do with the image actually moving after each resize and looking weird. It's probably because margin-left: auto; and margin-right: auto; does something mathy and less simple than <center> or text-align: center;
[07:50:09] <Eviltwin> Arun_: Yes
[07:50:16] <Arun_> oh. thank you =)
[07:50:30] <Eviltwin> However lets say you had <p class="Hire">Click <i>here</i></p>
[07:50:35] <globe_tmp> Eviltwin:  row.children but i need to specify the second column and looking for the  div
[07:50:51] <Eviltwin> If they click "Click", event.target.nodeName is "P"
[07:50:58] <Eviltwin> If they click "here", event.target.nodeName is "I"
[07:51:04] <globe_tmp> ah ok
[07:51:08] <globe_tmp> it's clear :)
[07:51:44] <Eviltwin> globe_tmp: http://pastie.org/3062914
[07:53:51] <Eviltwin> globe_tmp: Although I have a feeling this is actually what you're looking for: http://pastie.org/3062917
[07:55:35] <globe_tmp> Eviltwin:  that's exactly what i was looking for ! , thanks
[07:57:03] <bblfish> hello a simple beginner question
[07:57:23] <bblfish> is there a how to on how to move a function into an external js file?
[07:57:46] <bblfish> I wrote it in the html and it works, and now I want to move it out
[07:58:02] <bblfish> do the $("something") still work?
[07:59:35] <B-lue> hmmm
[08:00:03] <B-lue> any idea why http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload isn't working on my site - http://www.justinsjournal.com/test ?
[08:00:07] <Eviltwin> bblfish: So you know how you have a <script> tag in your code?
[08:00:18] <Eviltwin> bblfish: For jQuery
[08:00:20] <bblfish> yes, that works
[08:00:34] <bblfish> with the javscript in my <script> code
[08:00:39] <Eviltwin> As long as the <script> tags for yor external scripts are after that one
[08:00:43] <Eviltwin> You can use $("something")
[08:00:55] <Eviltwin> The ones before can't because it won't be loaded at that point
[08:01:03] <bblfish> ah ok. I think it works in fact you are right
[08:01:06] <jomofcw> bblfish you just have to load it on DOM ready $(function(){/* your stuff */});
[08:01:34] <bblfish> yep that's what I am doing now
[08:01:34] <bblfish>  $(document).ready(doit());
[08:01:50] <quicksilver> you really don't want those () after doit.
[08:02:12] <xckpd7> what would be the most logical replacement for mootools email validation?
[08:02:21] <quicksilver> either "$(document).ready(doit);" or "$(document).ready(function(){doit();});"
[08:02:22] <B-lue> anyone? :D
[08:02:28] <xckpd7> I just figured out Mootools is checking the email to see if it's proper or not
[08:02:50] <quicksilver> but $( is a short hand for $(document).ready( so the shortest thing you could write is simply "$(doit)";
[08:02:51] <jomofcw> xckpd7 look at the validation plugin
[08:03:46] <bblfish> ah ok
[08:04:47] <bblfish> cool it works, thanks
[08:06:39] <B-lue> any idea why http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload isn't working on my site - http://www.justinsjournal.com/test ?
[08:08:11] <bblfish> perfect $(doit) worked
[08:09:34] <pulse00> hi all. i'm accessing an dom element inside the .change() callback of an input field. now when i reload that element via ajax, jquery seems to reference the "old" element, hence not updating the newly injected element correctly. has anyone a hint how to implement this properly?
[08:10:07] <Eviltwin> pulse00: If you can show us an example of your problem in a jsFiddle.net
[08:10:17] <Eviltwin> We can taylor a solution to your needs
[08:10:36] <Eviltwin> But its likely the solution will be to use .delegate instead of .change
[08:10:43] <Eviltwin> pulse00: see ?.delegate
[08:10:43] <bot-t> pulse00, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:11:08] <B-lue> Eviltwin: any idea?
[08:11:15] <xckpd7> *tailor
[08:11:32] <pulse00> Eviltwin: thanks
[08:11:39] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Yes, my bad
[08:11:49] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: don't let it happen again
[08:12:11] <Eviltwin> :P
[08:12:44] <B-lue> ....'
[08:13:01] <Eviltwin> I felt wrong when I wrote it but I didn't care
[08:13:40] <kborchers> B-lue: it would probably help to remove the overflow: hidden; from your body
[08:14:24] <B-lue> ah
[08:14:27] <B-lue> done thanks :D
[08:14:34] <Eviltwin> B-lue: I wrote you an alternative solution and you decided to ignore it so I'm not really sure why you expect me to help you any more
[08:14:36] <B-lue> still isn't loading the actual image though :/
[08:14:45] <B-lue> Eviltwin: alternative solution?>
[08:14:49] <B-lue> i'm using it for images
[08:15:12] <kborchers> B-lue: you'll also need to run lazyload() on dom ready
[08:15:22] <Arun_> in order to get id and class of any element say <p id="any" class="thing"></p>, we need to write $('p').attr('id'); and $('p').attr('class');
[08:15:25] <Arun_> isn't there any shortcut
[08:15:36] <Arun_> for these two attributes ?
[08:15:48] <B-lue> kborchers: where? I havent any idea tbh.. I was just following whats on that site
[08:16:16] <Sean-Der> button[class='delrow']
[08:16:20] <Sean-Der> Is this possible?
[08:16:32] <Eviltwin> B-lue: http://jsfiddle.net/uwYW7/
[08:16:33] <kborchers> ?ready @ B-lue
[08:16:33] <bot-t> B-lue, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[08:16:42] <Eviltwin> ?tias @ Sean-Der
[08:16:43] <bot-t> Sean-Der, Try It And See
[08:17:11] <B-lue> kborchers: thanks. any idea why I dont see that on http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/enabled.html in the source, but it works still?
[08:17:14] <kborchers> Sean-Der: though why would you do that??
[08:17:19] <B-lue> Eviltwin: checking it out now
[08:17:41] <B-lue> DUDE
[08:17:42] <B-lue> !
[08:17:45] <Sean-Der> If a certain class of button is fired I am then getting information from its ID and doing other stuff
[08:17:51] <B-lue> Thats exactly what I need/want :D
[08:18:01] <B-lue> thanks so much!
[08:18:40] <Eviltwin> B-lue: So read it, try to understand what's happening
[08:18:44] <Eviltwin> And ask questions
[08:18:47] <Eviltwin> If needed
[08:18:51] <B-lue> Eviltwin: alright :D OMFG! Thanks =)
[08:19:00] <Eviltwin> It's currently using the jsFiddle /echo/html/ API
[08:19:04] <Eviltwin> For AJAX
[08:19:10] <Sean-Der> Sorry it IS working. It just doesn't exist in the DOM at load. So I need to use Delege
[08:19:13] <Eviltwin> You'll swap that out with your own AJAX
[08:19:18] <kborchers> B-lue: because they used $(function(){...}); which does the same thing
[08:19:36] <Sean-Der> I saw mention of something called .now is that what we should be using?
[08:19:45] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: see ?.now
[08:19:45] <bot-t> Sean-Der, jQuery.now(): Return a number representing the current time. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.now/
[08:19:55] <Eviltwin> Does that look like what you want? :P
[08:20:22] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ Sean-Der
[08:20:22] <bot-t> Sean-Der, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[08:20:39] <Sean-Der> Yes exactly!! Thats perfect I need the time....
[08:20:42] <B-lue> Eviltwin: so /echo/html/ is whats in the html box on top left right?
[08:20:44] <Sean-Der> Ok I will give an example
[08:20:53] <Eviltwin> B-lue: No
[08:21:04] <Eviltwin> B-lue: Look at this: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[08:21:13] <Eviltwin> It's how they do fake AJAX for the purposes of a demo on jsFiddle
[08:21:19] <Arun_> what does "event.target.results" give ?
[08:21:32] <Eviltwin> Arun_: "event.target" is the DOM element that was clicked
[08:21:55] <Eviltwin> You'd be accessing the "results" property of it
[08:22:01] <Eviltwin> But that's not standard for DOM elements
[08:22:02] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/W3G4MjKK
[08:22:07] <Sean-Der> This is what I am doing now.
[08:22:08] <Arun_> hmm..
[08:22:11] <sphinxxx> what's the purpose of a plugin using jQuery.fn , instead of just jQuery ?
[08:22:15] <B-lue> Eviltwin: is there a way to view whats in the /echo/html now?
[08:22:23] <Sean-Der> I saw Eviltwin mention something earlier about how in 1.7 there is a better way to do it
[08:22:28] <quicksilver> sphinxxx: jQuery.fn is all the methods which exist on jquery objects
[08:22:38] <Eviltwin> B-lue: Look down two lines from the "/echo/html/"
[08:22:48] <Eviltwin> B-lue: That's exactly the data it's going to send back :P
[08:23:02] <Eviltwin> B-lue: And it's going to do it after a delay of 1 second
[08:23:27] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: When does that button get created?
[08:23:36] <Eviltwin> Does it get replaced/changed often?
[08:23:50] <Eviltwin> Does that match more than one button?
[08:24:09] <Eviltwin> And BTW, if you're matching against a class, you can just do button.delrow
[08:24:15] <Eviltwin> Which will probably be faster anyway
[08:25:11] <B-lue> Eviltwin: Ah! I think I see now, maybe.. Whats in the javascript box on the (http://jsfiddle.net/uwYW7/) is what I should put in a javascript file? or ? I'm total newbie...
[08:25:49] <Eviltwin> B-lue: jsFiddle is designed for making small demonstrations of code
[08:25:56] <Eviltwin> And it tries to keep you organized
[08:26:15] <Eviltwin> The top HTML portion gets put inside the <body> tag
[08:26:25] <Eviltwin> The bottom portion gets put inside a <script> tag in the <head>
[08:26:39] <Eviltwin> The CSS portion gets put inside a <style> tag in the <head>
[08:26:56] <pulse00> Eviltwin: this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/uDtMu/1/ i'm not sure if it's be solved with .delegate() though
[08:26:58] <Eviltwin> Or you could put it in an external file if you wanted
[08:27:39] <B-lue> Eviltwin: but how come whats in the html portion in the div's isn't showing in the demo?
[08:27:40] <Eviltwin> pulse00: I'm not sure what you're trying to do
[08:28:11] <Eviltwin> B-lue: You don't see a bunch of boxes that say "Content" when it loads?
[08:28:44] <pulse00> Eviltwin: there's an input field which filters a list in the change event. the list can be reloaded via ajax on that page. the second time the list is loaded, filtering does not work anymore, and i think it's because the change callback has a reference to the "old" list element
[08:28:58] <Eviltwin> pulse00: Why are you using antique jQuery?
[08:29:02] <B-lue> Oh yes I do now.. I refreshed.. so after so many preloaded div's it then goes to the javascript/ajax for the remainder, right?
[08:29:21] <Eviltwin> B-lue: So there are a bunch of divs that say "Content" when it starts, right?
[08:29:26] <B-lue> yulp
[08:29:26] <Eviltwin> Those are the ones actually in the HTML
[08:29:31] <Eviltwin> When you hit the bottom
[08:29:39] <Eviltwin> It loads a new one from the server
[08:29:47] <Eviltwin> You'll see those actually say "Dynamic Content"
[08:29:54] <B-lue> yeah
[08:30:12] <Eviltwin> So when you hit the bottom of the page
[08:30:18] <Eviltwin> It starts loading more from the server
[08:30:22] <Eviltwin> Via AJAX
[08:30:27] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[08:30:34] <B-lue> yeah it does.. :D
[08:30:41] <pulse00> Eviltwin: what would be cutting-edge jquery in that case then?
[08:30:55] <B-lue> I appericiate it so much man.. I'm sorry I missed it earlier if you pasted it earlier
[08:30:58] <pulse00> you mean the use of the .change() method?
[08:31:29] <Eviltwin> Are you using jQuery 1.4.0?
[08:31:32] <B-lue> ah man :D
[08:31:55] <pulse00> Eviltwin: ah no. that's misconfigured in the jsfiddle. shjould be 1.7.1
[08:32:03] <Eviltwin> Okay, much better then :P
[08:33:42] <B-lue> Eviltwin: so what do I put in <script> to load the ajax thats in say posts.js ?
[08:34:04] <Eviltwin> Well what does posts.js have?
[08:34:13] <B-lue> well it will have the js
[08:34:22] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry
[08:34:35] <Eviltwin> <script type="text/javascript" src="posts.js"></script>
[08:34:40] <B-lue> oh that easy
[08:34:44] <B-lue> lol thanks ;D
[08:35:20] <B-lue> You seriously have no idea how hard I have been looking to find something like that and I absolutely couldnt find it.
[08:39:23] <Eviltwin> bot-t: tell pulse00 http://jsfiddle.net/uDtMu/2/
[08:39:23] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Okay.
[08:40:07] <B-lue> Eviltwin: I may be asking too much, but I am planning on keeping the posts.js for well ever to make all the #content be in the posts.js?
[08:40:11] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hi can you use toggle() but tell it to fadein and fadeout instead of show/hide?
[08:40:41] <B-lue> like only load 5 at first from posts.js and then load more as scrolled, and not the the initial div's loaded from html?
[08:40:54] <joshualibrarian> So I have this div with a set of slides in it, all with class="slide"...  I have a variable with the current slide number, and I want to pull some data out of the current slide to update another div... currently I am attempting the selector:
[08:40:55] <joshualibrarian> $('.slide :eq('+current+')')
[08:41:07] <Eviltwin> B-lue: I didn't quite understand "I am planning on keeping  the posts.js for well ever to
[08:41:45] <B-lue> Eviltwin: I mean what would I need to put in the html to not have the content div's in html, but to have the initial ones in the posts.js aswell
[08:41:52] <joshualibrarian> which outputs in the console log as:
[08:41:52] <joshualibrarian> ({length:1, prevObject:{0:#1=({}), context:#1#, length:1}, context:#1#, selector:".slide :eq(2)", 0:({})})
[08:41:57] <ajpiano> joshualibrarian: you need .slide:eq... no space
[08:42:07] <ajpiano> but joshualibrarian it would be better to cache the entire set and use the .eq() method instead
[08:42:19] <B-lue> like I wanna have all the div's with the class content loaded from posts.js but dynamically as scrolled
[08:42:20] <joshualibrarian> however, when I try to get ANYTHING From it.... .html(), .attr('title'), anything, I get either undefined or null.
[08:42:22] <ajpiano> var slides = $(".slide");   slide.eq(current)
[08:42:30] <ajpiano> joshualibrarian: it's because of the space
[08:42:48] <ajpiano> joshualibrarian: you aren't selecting elements with the selector you have
[08:43:04] <joshualibrarian> ajpiano: oh?  which space?  I'm confused....
[08:43:07] <B-lue> You know how when it's first ran it has those few initial div's that say Content.. well how can I have those in the posts.js instead of in the html file?
[08:43:11] <Eviltwin> Nicolas_Leonidas: http://jsfiddle.net/6mtL8/
[08:43:31] <ajpiano> joshualibrarian: $(".slide :eq(")
[08:43:42] <ajpiano> joshualibrarian: did you read the messages i just sent to you?
[08:43:53] <Eviltwin> B-lue: Where are these posts coming from
[08:43:59] <Eviltwin> Are you writing like PHP or something?
[08:44:04] <B-lue> no
[08:44:04] <Eviltwin> Do you have a backend?
[08:44:09] <B-lue> nope
[08:44:12] <B-lue> it'll all be manual
[08:44:16] <Eviltwin> So where are these posts coming from?
[08:44:21] <joshualibrarian> ajpiano: I
[08:44:24] <B-lue> I will be writing them individually
[08:45:16] <ajpiano> joshualibrarian: '.slide :eq('+current+')
[08:45:22] <ajpiano> the space in between slide and :eq
[08:45:27] <ajpiano> makes it into a descendant selector
[08:45:32] <ajpiano> instead of filtering the .slides
[08:45:47] <joshualibrarian> ajpiano: OH
[08:45:52] <Eviltwin> So it becomes basically .slide *:eq(...)
[08:46:01] <Eviltwin> Anything inside .slide
[08:46:08] <Eviltwin> Then the `current` one
[08:46:12] <B-lue> I really hate databases which is why I dont want to use wordpress, and I really dont like the blog  options that are databaseless... I plan to manually type daily in the posts.js my latest entry..
[08:46:23] <ajpiano> joshualibrarian: as i said though, it would be better to make a reference to all the slides, and use the .eq() method
[08:46:28] <ajpiano> B-lue: that's a terrible idea
[08:46:46] <yogurt_truck> "I really hate databases"
[08:46:51] <B-lue> Have a better one that doesnt include a database?
[08:46:58] <Eviltwin> Wordpress uses a database
[08:47:05] <joshualibrarian> oh.
[08:47:06] <Eviltwin> But Wordpress isn't a database
[08:47:14] <Eviltwin> If I talk about databases, I'm not talking about Wordpress
[08:47:16] <B-lue> yeah thats what I mean
[08:47:17] <ajpiano> B-lue: i assume you've also dismissed using any static site generators like jekyll or octopress?
[08:47:28] <B-lue> ajpiano: never heard of them tbh
[08:47:35] <ajpiano> so you really did your research
[08:47:43] <ajpiano> before settling on "blogging inside of a .js file"
[08:47:55] <B-lue> well I usually searched for databaseless blog, blog without database, etc..
[08:48:05] <erichynds> why do you hate databases?
[08:48:39] <B-lue> well I may not hate them all, but I really dont like mysql, and its the one I most commonly used
[08:48:40] <Eviltwin> If you hate databases, it means you don't really understand them
[08:48:43] <yogurt_truck> i hate things that store my stuff and then let me query them!
[08:48:44] <Eviltwin> Or don't like things being organized
[08:48:49] <B-lue> Eviltwin: thats probably true
[08:48:55] <erichynds> but why?
[08:49:12] <DashNY> hi guys
[08:49:13] <B-lue> I do like organization which is why I was thinking about the whole posts.js
[08:49:19] <B-lue> thing
[08:49:21] <Eviltwin> That's not organized
[08:49:28] <Eviltwin> That's not even close to organized
[08:49:29] <globe_tmp> B-lue:  may be it's what you're looking for http://www.persvr.org/Page/Persevere :d
[08:49:30] <blackspotwiggins> B-lue, flat file store is also a database
[08:49:33] <blackspotwiggins> a shitty one
[08:50:08] <meesebyte> eviltwin: it seems nobody knows what they're talking about in #css
[08:50:23] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Well don't ask me about CSS
[08:50:33] <Eviltwin> It's probably the language / markup I know least well
[08:50:44] <Eviltwin> Aside from maybe English
[08:50:46] <meesebyte> ok :)
[08:51:16] <meesebyte> eviltwin: how do I add timer/delay/whatever, anything to slow down or speed up the animation? http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/ZCt5n/95/
[08:51:22] <ajpiano> B-lue: http://octopress.org/
[08:51:35] <DashNY> how do I get the underlying dom object's reference (e.g. of type HTMLLIElement) using jquery?
[08:51:51] <Eviltwin> DashNY: see ?.get
[08:51:51] <bot-t> DashNY, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[08:51:51] <ajpiano> DashNY: use .get(index) or index the jquery object as an array $("#foo")[0]
[08:52:20] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: see ?.animate
[08:52:21] <bot-t> meesebyte, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[08:52:23] <B-lue> ajpiano: checking it out now, thanks alot :D
[08:52:43] <ajpiano> B-lue: "putting something somewhere" is not the same thing as "being organized" )
[08:52:52] <ajpiano> B-lue: otherwise my apartment would be considered "very organized"
[08:52:56] <B-lue> lol
[08:53:15] <ajpiano> javascript is for scripting the behaviour of pages, not for storing actual content
[08:53:50] <joshualibrarian> So this selector WORKS, giving me always the first slide's title.
[08:53:50] <joshualibrarian> $('.slide').attr('title')
[08:53:54] <shal3r> Is it possible to animate width by 2px per frame, not 1px?
[08:53:55] <joshualibrarian> however, this one....
[08:54:26] <Eviltwin> joshualibrarian: Are you looking for $(".slide").map(function(){return $(this).attr("title")}).get()?
[08:54:32] <joshualibrarian> however this one produces undefined:
[08:54:32] <joshualibrarian> $('.slide').eq(current).attr('title')
[08:54:45] <Eviltwin> Well what's current?
[08:55:08] <B-lue> yes I know, but I was looking basically for something small without a bunch of bloat as I have no need for facebook, or social stuff, or plugins.. just plain text with a picture here, and there.. I just wanted to load the plain text, and such on scroll so someone, or I didn't have to load 2 years of journal text at once
[08:55:29] <ajpiano> B-lue: you don't have to include any of that stuff
[08:55:38] <Eviltwin> B-lue: Putting everything in one file is a bad idea
[08:55:41] <ajpiano> (the social stuff)
[08:55:50] <Eviltwin> One JS file
[08:55:54] <Eviltwin> Your entire blog
[08:56:03] <ajpiano> is certifiably an insane approach
[08:56:06] <B-lue> lol
[08:56:18] <Eviltwin> You know that having a database doesn't imply any of that crap, right?
[08:56:42] <NoiseEee> B-lue: enjoy writing long text with linebreaks in JS!
[08:56:55] <B-lue> yeah, but it seems the databases I know of, or used (MySQL) has so much crap I personally don't need.
[08:57:13] <B-lue> I just need something to store plain text, and url links to images..
[08:57:27] <NoiseEee> B-lue: that doesn't really work well when more than a couple people hit it at once
[08:57:28] <Eviltwin> Sounds like HTML is your solution
[08:57:30] <NoiseEee> you're on the right track
[08:57:33] <ajpiano> B-lue: have you considered static htm
[08:57:38] <ajpiano> lol
[08:57:53] <ajpiano> static html is how i did my first blog when i was 14
[08:57:59] <ajpiano> IT WORKS EVERY TIME
[08:58:29] <Eviltwin> My site is mostly HTML currently
[08:58:31] <B-lue> yeah I wanna use static html, but I just wanted to load the posts part dynamically as someone scrolled down.. like top would be most recent post, and as you scrolled down it would go yesterday, day before, last year, etc..
[08:58:39] <Eviltwin> I mean it actually uses PHP to stitch a few static files together
[08:58:40] <blackspotwiggins> B-lue, maybe just use tumblr orother hosted stuff
[08:58:52] <Eviltwin> But it could be static
[08:59:03] <joshualibrarian> ajpiano: that sure did something!  reading about .map()... that outputs for my debugging:["Slide1 Title", "Slide2 Title"]
[08:59:04] <meesebyte> eviltwin,  ajpiano: was the same with my website. but trying to add lots of cool jquery.
[08:59:08] <B-lue> blackspotwiggins: I wanna host it myself tbh.. I have a vps, and such thats only 15/yr that I use for other stuff too
[08:59:19] <ajpiano> joshualibrarian: i didn't say anything about map
[08:59:20] <blackspotwiggins> if you cant figure out mysql, you are wasting your money
[08:59:24] <Eviltwin> joshualibrarian: But I did
[08:59:27] <erichynds> 15/yr VPS?
[08:59:29] <B-lue> I have mysql installed now
[08:59:31] <erichynds> wat
[08:59:42] <blackspotwiggins> 15 TONS OF GOLD
[08:59:48] <B-lue> I just dont need what it offers.. I need plain text loaded dynamically ;P
[08:59:56] <Eviltwin> $15/yr sounds a little on the cheap side for a true VPS
[08:59:56] <B-lue> erichynds: http://www.buyvm.net
[09:00:11] <B-lue> they are heard all over the net with vps's.. they are awesome
[09:00:21] <Eviltwin> Oh, a very limited VPS
[09:00:21] <erichynds> mysql isn't just for the enterprise ™ you know
[09:00:31] <blackspotwiggins> it's not for enterprise at all :)
[09:00:35] <B-lue> they arent limited imo..
[09:00:37] <Eviltwin> Also not for the USS Enterprise
[09:00:38] <kkuno> hi
[09:00:40] <shal3r> B-lue, then you can save each post to different HTML file and load these files dynamically via AJAX on scrolling ;)
[09:00:40] <NoiseEee> B-lue: the entire point of a database is to do what you're describing you want to do
[09:00:45] <NoiseEee> B-lue: thanks for coming out!
[09:00:53] <kkuno> something like     obj.find('> div')   will work?
[09:01:04] <erichynds> kkuno: use children() instead
[09:01:06] <erichynds> butyeah
[09:01:13] <kkuno> ok thanks
[09:01:24] <joshualibrarian> eviltwin: I'm a bit confused by that one.  Now I've got both titles, but I need only one.
[09:01:37] <Eviltwin> joshualibrarian: Which one?
[09:01:46] <Eviltwin> You know .eq(0) means the first one right?
[09:01:48] <ajpiano> B-lue: you are welcome to do whatever you want, just understand that no one is ever going to really be interested in helping you with your solution and that there is a reason people use actual blogging engines, be they powered by an actual "database" or not, instead of just lumping a bunch of content inside of a javascript file
[09:01:58] <erichynds> thats like saying you want to make a website, but don't want to write it in html because there are a lot of tags you probably won't sue
[09:01:59] <erichynds> use*
[09:02:18] <shal3r> lol
[09:02:19] <blackspotwiggins> erichynds, would it be possible to roll custom dtd? :P
[09:02:59] <B-lue> ajpiano: I understand.. I just really think all that other stuff is bloat in a case of someone just wanting to have a simple blog, and not do all the plugins, etc..
[09:03:18] <Eviltwin> B-lue: A simple blog would be a static HTML file
[09:03:21] <Eviltwin> That you edit
[09:03:27] <NoiseEee> B-lue: you have a skewed definition of the word 'bloat'
[09:03:45] <NoiseEee> B-lue: by your definition, if your CPU isn't workign @ 100% all time, why bother with that speed CPU?  go lower!
[09:03:49] <B-lue> yes thats what I want but I didn't want to have someone load tons, and tons of pictures/text at once
[09:03:59] <NoiseEee> B-lue: you get to control all of that
[09:04:03] <B-lue> so I wanted it on scroll..
[09:04:08] <NoiseEee> you can do that
[09:04:09] <ajpiano> B-lue: ithat's like saying living in a house is bloat, because in reality, you don't *really* need a toilet or a refrigerator
[09:04:21] <blackspotwiggins> oh well
[09:04:27] <B-lue> NoiseEee: please tell
[09:04:31] <blackspotwiggins> that's #jquery for you, see you in another month :D
[09:04:33] <Eviltwin> blackspotwiggins: ?
[09:04:41] <joshualibrarian> eviltwin: it's the zero index that was my problem!  I was doing .eq(current), but I needed .eq(current-1)
[09:05:11] <NoiseEee> B-lue: you get to control how many entries you want at once, which ones, etc etc
[09:05:13] <blackspotwiggins> can be summed up with http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwinvshFtr1qa4fpmo1_500.jpg
[09:05:26] <B-lue> I do want static html.. I want everything in one file.. I just wanted it loaded as needed as you scroll down..
[09:05:28] <NoiseEee> B-lue: its not all or nothing.  its called learning how to write SQL, its a necessary part of developing for the web
[09:05:37] <joshualibrarian> EUREKA!  It works!  Thank you all!
[09:05:38] <Eviltwin> blackspotwiggins: You realize that A) we have no obligation to help anyone, B) we don't have like an official question queue and not infrequently miss questions entirely and C) targeting individuals is not a good idea 'cause everyone comes and goes
[09:05:54] <blackspotwiggins> Eviltwin, yea i know
[09:06:06] <Eviltwin> blackspotwiggins: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[09:06:07] <blackspotwiggins> it's fun what kind of inane stuff comes up here tho
[09:06:09] <NoiseEee> B-lue: you do realize that a backend creates the html file, as little/large as you want, and lets you do things like control 'scrolling down' stuff
[09:06:11] <Eviltwin> Then once you've made it through the advanced level
[09:06:23] <Eviltwin> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[09:06:32] <blackspotwiggins> Eviltwin, dude wat
[09:06:40] <blackspotwiggins> im not the one doing a cms in js
[09:06:47] <todd_work> what Eviltwin said. i keep going back to it for patterns etc.
[09:07:17] <B-lue> NoiseEee: yes I know... I have wordpress installed now.. I just don't need it tbh.. I just want all my posts in one file, and as you scroll down it loads more of that file with the posts..
[09:07:26] <NoiseEee> B-lue: best of luck
[09:07:40] <NoiseEee> B-lue: come back with any jquery specific questions that arise
[09:07:44] <B-lue> lol
[09:07:46] <B-lue> will do
[09:08:15] <B-lue> I wish someone would start developing that jquery load infitie thing again..
[09:08:44] <B-lue> http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[09:08:49] <B-lue> its dead now though it seems
[09:09:07] <B-lue> its exactly what I need :P
[09:09:10] <todd_work> B-lue, is your question not about databases but "how do i use jquery to scroll all of my content"?
[09:09:17] <B-lue> yes
[09:09:20] <blackspotwiggins> yep, infinite scroll plugin makes a cms
[09:09:34] <B-lue> todd_work: exactly all I needed
[09:09:55] <todd_work> then ask it.
[09:10:33] <B-lue> well http://jsfiddle.net/uwYW7/ is essentially it, but I was asking if I could put everything in one posts.js file so all my posts would be there, and I would only need to backup that one file..
[09:11:01] <B-lue> but if there is a way to make everything in posts.html (a static html file) load on scroll then that is what I want
[09:11:06] <Eviltwin> B-lue: And we're telling you that putting a whole CMS in one JavaScript file is a really bad idea
[09:11:29] <sphinxxx> b-lue, you shouldn't really do stuff in the scroll event
[09:11:30] <ajpiano> B-lue: and even putting "all your posts" in a single html file is a bad idea too
[09:11:42] <sphinxxx> or if you do, debounce it so its not constantly firing
[09:11:49] <B-lue> why is it a bad idea?
[09:11:56] <ajpiano> it's completely unmaintainable and unscalable to have a blog like that
[09:12:02] <ajpiano> B-lue: you can't have permalinks to individual pages
[09:12:06] <B-lue> so?
[09:12:07] <blackspotwiggins> maintaniblity is bloat
[09:12:09] <Mkop> GAH
[09:12:10] <Mkop> I hate IE7
[09:12:11] <blackspotwiggins> :)
[09:12:24] <ajpiano> B-lue: you know what, i'm gonna go buy some xmas presents
[09:12:27] <erichynds> let him learn fellas
[09:12:28] <B-lue> lol
[09:12:29] <ajpiano> B-lue: you work on your blog
[09:12:34] <Mkop> I try to write good, functional (in the functional programming sense) code and it doesn't let me
[09:12:37] <ajpiano> and let's all pretend this never happened
[09:12:40] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Kinda last minute, no? :P
[09:12:42] <B-lue> lol
[09:12:50] <Mkop> doesn't seem like jquery has a cross-browser equivalent of Array.filter
[09:12:56] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: just some last minute things, mostly need boxes and wrapping paper
[09:13:01] <Eviltwin> Mkop: see ?.grep perhas?
[09:13:01] <bot-t> Mkop, jQuery.grep(array, function, [invert]): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[09:13:18] <B-lue> have fun in those jam packed stores..
[09:13:19] <B-lue> :P
[09:13:22] <todd_work> B-lue:  http://www.queness.com/post/356/create-a-vertical-horizontal-and-diagonal-sliding-content-website-with-jquery
[09:13:29] <Eviltwin> B-lue: I think he'll have more fun there than here :P
[09:14:40] <B-lue> todd_work, thanks alot that may work, and I could create a menu to hyperlink to post #59559595
[09:15:05] <Mkop> oh, NICE! Thanks Eviltwin!
[09:15:15] <B-lue> wait
[09:15:23] <B-lue> that doesnt work because it loasds everything at once
[09:15:26] <B-lue> loads
[09:15:36] <B-lue> its just "hidden"
[09:15:58] <ajpiano> B-lue: you realise that all the *javascript* with all the content in it will ALSO load all at once
[09:16:01] <NoiseEee> B-lue: you don't get to load a JS file a portion at a time
[09:16:07] <todd_work> right. the web browser is going to read the whole document hidden or no.
[09:16:18] <NoiseEee> B-lue: also, troll of the month
[09:16:22] <Eviltwin> B-lue: That's why people have more than one file
[09:16:26] <B-lue> well I more mean like this - http://jsfiddle.net/uwYW7/
[09:16:51] <B-lue> but it all be in html, or all in js(not the actual stying, etc.. just the POSTS part)
[09:16:55] <Mkop> does IE7 not even have Array.indexOf???
[09:17:03] <Mkop> *sigh*
[09:17:55] <NoiseEee> Mkop: its easy enough to add it / use jquery inArray?!
[09:18:05] <erichynds> also, underscore.js
[09:18:10] <erichynds> do you speak it?
[09:18:49] <Mkop> erichynds: are you talking to me?
[09:18:54] <erichynds> yeah
[09:19:48] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a problem for #underscore
[09:19:59] <Eviltwin> Mkop: see ?.inArray
[09:19:59] <bot-t> Mkop, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[09:20:33] <Mkop> thanks. I already replaced indexOf with that, and will research underscore.js as well
[09:21:41] <B-lue> well thanks alot everyone.. I guess this troll - will troll you later.. I will get the dyanic content load going somehow though.. thanks again Eviltwin for the jsfiddle :D
[09:22:01] <erichynds> you're by boy, b-lue
[09:22:06] <Mkop> what else I hate about IE7: it helpfully tells me that an error occured on line 716 char 5, but fails to tell me which file
[09:22:35] <Eviltwin> Mkop: This is why people who develop for IE put vastly varying amounts of blank lines at the top of their JS files
[09:22:43] <Mkop> lol
[09:22:49] <Eviltwin> So the line numbers never overlap
[09:23:02] <Mkop> I think it is in jquery-1.7.1.js
[09:23:07] <nickadeemus2002> hi there!  can anyone help with a question about the firebug console tool?
[09:23:15] <Eviltwin> nickadeemus2002: Perhaps
[09:24:06] <nickadeemus2002> hi eviltwin.  in have a line in code that says console.log(Shops); , which will show a large array of about 50 objects.
[09:24:40] <nickadeemus2002> is there anyway for me to get this array from the console panel without having to write a script to loop everything?
[09:24:59] <Eviltwin> "get" it?
[09:24:59] <nickadeemus2002> i need to get at the data in the Shops array and see all the data in the firebug console
[09:25:22] <Eviltwin> How about console.log(JSON.stringify(Shops))
[09:25:24] <nickadeemus2002> yes, get it , as in a print out so i can copy and paste it then move it into a file
[09:25:32] <nickadeemus2002> ok
[09:25:38] <nickadeemus2002> let me try that....thanks
[09:26:54] <nickadeemus2002> ET:  that did it bud.  always a fan : )
[09:27:19] <Sean-Der> Can I append a TD in a table row?
[09:28:02] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: Only if you really want to
[09:28:30] <Eviltwin> nickadeemus2002: Then maybe you could help me reach my goal: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[09:28:49] <NoiseEee> $28!! SWEET
[09:28:50] <hexa2k9> hi, how can I "export" the data which was returned by getJSON to a variable which is available within a complete script? e.g. https://gist.github.com/da14af32ebd1f9e51a00
[09:29:16] <Eviltwin> hexa2k9: otherVariable = data;?
[09:29:23] <Eviltwin> I don't understand
[09:29:57] <NoiseEee> also, what does 'export' mean to you?
[09:30:22] <sphinxxx> hexa2k9, only global variables will be available anywhere in the script
[09:30:49] <sphinxxx> also depends how you want the data formatted
[09:31:13] <Eviltwin> hexa2k9: Are you trying to do something like this? http://pastebin.com/qkFc7PMm
[09:31:17] <Eviltwin> 'Cause that's not going to work
[09:31:25] <Eviltwin> console.log will give you "undefined"
[09:31:31] <hexa2k9> that's true
[09:31:39] <hexa2k9> yes, exactly like this
[09:31:59] <Eviltwin> If something relies on that data, you need to do it in the success
[09:32:10] <Eviltwin> Or some callback for the getJSON function
[09:33:07] <kborchers> ?ajax101 @ hexa2k9
[09:33:07] <bot-t> hexa2k9, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[09:33:29] <hexa2k9> thanks
[09:33:39] <Eviltwin> Gotta remember that link
[09:33:47] <sodapop> can i define that something is a .button() and give the click function in the same statement
[09:34:28] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: http://jqfundamentals.com/#example-3.13
[09:34:30] <Eviltwin> sodapop: http://jqfundamentals.com/#example-3.13
[09:34:32] <Eviltwin> Rather
[10:03:17] <Bish> this.click(['yo'],function(eventObject){alert(eventObject[0]);}); why does this doesn't work?
[10:03:27] <Eviltwin> $(this).click
[10:03:47] <Bish> this is already a jquery object, since im inside of a plugin
[10:04:31] <Eviltwin> function(event,data){alert(data[0])}
[10:04:54] <necromancer> nickadeemus2002: did you know there's a dj (nickodemus) with your name?
[10:05:16] <Bish> Eviltwin, uhm, no
[10:05:32] <Eviltwin> Uhm, yes
[10:05:37] <nickadeemus2002> @necromancer: ha!  this i did not know ; 0
[10:05:54] <necromancer> nickadeemus2002: http://nickodemus.com/
[10:05:59] <Bish> Eviltwin, doesnt work
[10:06:12] <Bish> this.button.click('yo',function(event,data){alert(data);});
[10:06:29] <Eviltwin> Oh I lied
[10:06:37] <Eviltwin> That's the other data
[10:07:07] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/Nm6Xp/
[10:07:47] <Bish> well thank you very much, but where could i find about this?
[10:07:56] <Eviltwin> ?.bind @ Bish
[10:07:56] <bot-t> Bish, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[10:08:30] <Eviltwin> Bish: http://jsfiddle.net/Nm6Xp/1/
[10:08:41] <nickadeemus2002> thanks for the link necromancer
[10:08:41] <Bish> well, that actually looks like .click, but.. do they have something written anywhere, which says
[10:08:49] <Bish> eventhandler/data has to look like that
[10:09:05] <nickadeemus2002> lol.  and the guy is from NYC...i work in NYC and Austin Texas
[10:09:15] <Eviltwin> Bish: .click(...) is a shortcut for .bind("click",...)
[10:09:26] <Eviltwin> And .click() is a shortcut for .trigger("click")
[10:09:34] <Eviltwin> Bish: see ?.click
[10:09:34] <bot-t> Bish, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[10:09:53] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure the data can be anything you want
[10:10:39] <Bish> yeah ofc, but where could've found that the handler function has to look like function(event,data){}
[10:10:47] <Bish> since i don't want to ask such silly qustions again
[10:10:59] <Eviltwin> Bish: It only has to look like it if you want to use the trigger data
[10:11:11] <Eviltwin> To do what you were doing, you don't need the data
[10:11:21] <Eviltwin> And you can call event eventObject or whatever you wanted
[10:12:07] <Bish> yeah well, BUT i thought the formal data parameter of the eventhandler was the thing containing my data
[10:12:18] <Bish> where could've found that it is event.data, what i am searching
[10:12:30] <gloomer> what data are you  trying to get from click event?
[10:12:52] <Bish> and what is data  :D?
[10:12:56] <Eviltwin> Bish: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[10:13:19] <Bish> its a form, handled by jquery.. and when i pressing the button, it should get the data in the textfields
[10:13:34] <Eviltwin> And the extra parameters are described here: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[10:13:39] <gloomer> ahh the .submit
[10:14:45] <Bish> okay cool, next time i will spend more time rtfm-ing
[10:14:48] <Bish> thank you very much
[10:52:31] <d7h> hello
[10:53:11] <d7h> in .scroll() how i can determinate if the user move vertical scrollbar?
[10:53:52] <Eviltwin> Well you can keep track of the scrollLeft and scrollTop properties
[10:54:32] <d7h> so i save previous coordinate in one var, is right?
[10:54:44] <Eviltwin> Sure
[10:56:14] <PPaul> in IE 8 can i do something like this [html:  <main></main>] [js: $('main').html("my html")  ]
[10:56:38] <PPaul> or do i have to use an id and ('#idname').html(...)
[10:56:46] <Eviltwin> Shouldn't have to
[10:57:09] <PPaul> i'm using 1.7.1 and i'm getting an error when i try to use .html on $('main')
[10:57:21] <afidegnum> hello, pls is there any jquery library allowing us to do a visual image search just like how google image search operates?
[10:57:22] <PPaul> $('main') is returning something, though
[10:57:47] <Eviltwin> PPaul: Do you have a noConflict or are you using some other library?
[10:57:53] <Eviltwin> afidegnum: Ha ha, no
[10:58:13] <afidegnum> hmm
[10:58:35] <PPaul> i don't have noconclickt
[10:58:47] <PPaul> i'm not using another lib with $
[10:59:05] <PPaul> i'm using underscore,backbone, and jquery plugins that work fine in other browsers
[10:59:09] <PPaul> just getting stuck in IE
[11:00:11] <Eviltwin> d7h: http://jsfiddle.net/2Uu5z/
[11:00:38] <aaairc> with the .each() function, how can you tell when its in its final loop?
[11:00:49] <Eviltwin> aaairc: You can't really
[11:00:50] <d7h> already dony, thanks and marry christmass :)
[11:00:53] <d7h> *done
[11:00:58] <Eviltwin> aaairc: Why?
[11:01:08] <Eviltwin> d7h: You're welcome
[11:01:29] <necromancer> how do i get the x/y coordinates of the mouse relative to the element i clicked on?
[11:01:33] <necromancer> or mousovered?
[11:01:48] <aaairc> Eviltwin: when the .each is done, i want to execute a relayout function, but right now the relayout doesn't seem to wait till its all finished
[11:02:00] <Eviltwin> necromancer: Start with the absolute coordinates
[11:02:06] <Eviltwin> necromancer: event.pageX and event.pageY
[11:02:10] <necromancer> ahhh really?
[11:02:17] <Eviltwin> necromancer: Get the .offset() for the element you want it to be relative to
[11:02:20] <Eviltwin> Subtract
[11:02:35] <aaairc> i think it might be because what happens in the .each function is an action that takes some time, so the .each keeps going while the inserts in the .each take some time to occur
[11:02:40] <Eviltwin> event.pageX - .left, event.pageY - .top
[11:03:05] <necromancer> Eviltwin: i dunno that sounds kinda brittle. suppose the element moves at some point? will i have to alter these intervals?
[11:03:07] <Eviltwin> aaairc: Can you show a code example?
[11:03:15] <Eviltwin> necromancer: What?
[11:03:27] <aaairc> Eviltwin: let me try
[11:03:37] <necromancer> Eviltwin: this is for the volume control of an audio player
[11:03:51] <necromancer> there's one big image, and depending on where you are in the image is where the volume indicator goes
[11:04:15] <RobSpectre> Is there a way to get a page to redraw without a page refresh?
[11:04:29] <necromancer> so you can over around the volume control to get the indicator moving and then click on it to actually change the volume
[11:04:35] <necromancer> s/over/hober
[11:04:39] <necromancer> s/hober/hover
[11:06:41] <necromancer> am i doing this the right way? this seems like the most simple actually
[11:07:53] <Eviltwin> necromancer: http://jsfiddle.net/yKw4B/
[11:08:04] <Eviltwin> Click and drag the box
[11:11:15] <Eviltwin> What's fragile about this?
[11:11:24] <Eviltwin> Or "brittle" as you said
[11:21:45] <Sean-Der> I am moving from delegate to .on

[11:21:53] <Sean-Der> This does not seem to be working?
[11:23:43] <Mkop> given a <div>containing <span id="name"></span> and a <span id="room"></span> </div> that I want to populate with {name:"John",room:"1023"}, what is the best tool for the job? is it worth pursuing backbone.js or the like, or should I just iterate over the object and $("#thediv").find("."+prop).text(value)?
[11:23:47] <necromancer> Eviltwin: thanks i thought you were talking about something else actually :)
[11:23:55] <necromancer> it worked! only problem now is i can't set the .data() of the element
[11:23:56] <erichynds> Sean-Der: you need to pass on() a selector a delegate to
[11:24:08] <necromancer> i tried $(this).data('level', calculatedLevel) but it didn't work
[11:24:14] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: $(a).delegate(b,c,d) becomes $(a).on(c,b,d)
[11:24:15] <Sean-Der> oh in this case body
[11:24:18] <necromancer> it did work when i did .attr('data-level'... though
[11:24:26] <necromancer> is .data() just a getter now?
[11:24:32] <Sean-Der> Sorry for not reading the docs well enough thank you
[11:24:34] <Eviltwin> No...
[11:24:41] <Eviltwin> necromancer: But are you cloing it or something weird like that?
[11:24:50] <necromancer> Eviltwin: cloning? no
[11:25:24] <Eviltwin> Mkop: You showed IDs and most fillers would operate on name, I imagine
[11:25:30] <Eviltwin> Probably best to just do your own
[11:25:47] <necromancer> Eviltwin: https://gist.github.com/1515142 is what my click action looks like
[11:26:03] <Mkop> I have control over the html as well. I could easily use name. Never thought to give spans names.
[11:26:10] <Eviltwin> necromancer: Okay
[11:26:21] <necromancer> here lemme fix that alignment for ya
[11:26:23] <necromancer> lol
[11:26:27] <necromancer> should be easier to read now
[11:27:07] <Eviltwin> That should work fine
[11:27:12] <Eviltwin> Where are you getting it?
[11:27:16] <necromancer> right but it doesn't
[11:27:19] <necromancer> getting what?
[11:27:33] <necromancer> .attr('data-level' does work, however...
[11:27:47] <Eviltwin> .data(key,value) is the setter
[11:27:48] <nocturne7> are you guys aware if ui.selectmenu.js is deprecated ?
[11:27:51] <Eviltwin> .data(key) is the getter
[11:27:55] <Eviltwin> Where are you using the getter?
[11:28:08] <necromancer> Eviltwin: i don't use the getter, i just re-set the data value depending on where they clicked
[11:28:19] <necromancer> that's what i want anyway
[11:28:31] <Eviltwin> Why?
[11:28:35] <Eviltwin> You set data but never use it?
[11:28:41] <necromancer> haha no i do use it
[11:28:47] <necromancer> just not yet
[11:28:56] <necromancer> the data actually controls the CSS background-position
[11:29:15] <Eviltwin> .data() won't change the attrs of the element
[11:29:21] <Eviltwin> If that's what you're asking
[11:29:31] <necromancer> so how does .data(key, value) work?
[11:29:33] <Eviltwin> But it subsequent calls to .data for the same key will get that info
[11:29:38] <Eviltwin> It's stored in JavaScript's memory
[11:29:40] <Eviltwin> Not with the actual element
[11:29:41] <necromancer> oh..
[11:29:48] <nocturne7> what jquery UI library am I supposed to use for 'select' input boxes ?
[11:30:01] <necromancer> i thought .data() attributes just looked up data-<attribute> in the element, and that's where all the data was stored
[11:30:19] <Eviltwin> necromancer: Actually it copies all of that stuff into JavaScript memory the firs ttime
[11:30:23] <Eviltwin> first time*
[11:30:25] <necromancer> ohhh i see
[11:30:27] <Eviltwin> And then just works on it in JavaScript
[11:30:41] <zayker> hi all
[11:30:46] <necromancer> that's strange i always thought it just worked like normal attributes
[11:30:54] <nocturne7> guys, plz help
[11:30:57] <Eviltwin> There was a reason for them not doing that
[11:31:00] <Eviltwin> Slow or something
[11:31:06] <necromancer> oh ok
[11:31:12] <necromancer> Eviltwin: hey one more thing...if i have a .bind('
[11:31:27] <necromancer> Eviltwin: hey one more thing...if i have a .bind('click mousover', can i use the event object to return the name of the event listener?
[11:31:38] <necromancer> like can i check in .bind() whether it's a "click" or "mouseover"?
[11:31:44] <kborchers> nocturne7: UI Selectmenu is still in dev http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Selectmenu
[11:31:59] <Eviltwin> necromancer: Yup
[11:32:13] <necromancer> cool
[11:32:16] <necromancer> i'll inspect that object
[11:32:19] <kborchers> nocturne7: there are links to plugins on there that could be used until it is released
[11:32:19] <Eviltwin> necromancer: Take a peek here: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[11:32:29] <necromancer> ooh much easier, thanks Eviltwin
[11:49:04] <nocturne7> kborchers: tnx for the explanation
[11:49:32] <sheldonh> how can i get access to the sortable that a sort item got dropped in? i'm using ui.item in the stop callback, but that gives me the sortable it came _from_
[11:51:35] <kborchers> sheldonh: r u using two connected sortables?
[11:51:52] <sheldonh> kborchers: yup
[11:52:22] <sheldonh> kborchers: i may have gotten lost in the dom. is ui.item.parent() in the stop callback supposed to gimme the drop target?
[11:52:24] <kborchers> the receiving sortable fires a receive event when an item is ... received
[11:53:45] <sheldonh> kborchers: okay, that will be better.
[11:54:54] <sheldonh> kborchers: do you know whether it's possible to allow dragging to other sortables *without* using connectWith? i notice connectWith stalling the page render for a small amount of time (probably because i make every .sortable connectWith every other .sortable)
[11:56:44] <kborchers> sheldonh: not sure .. don't actually use sortables that often see ?tias
[11:56:45] <bot-t> sheldonh, Try It And See
[11:57:22] <Eviltwin> connectWith takes a selector
[11:57:55] <sheldonh> Eviltwin: yeah, so i do $(".sortable").sortable( "option", "connectWith", '.sortable' );
[11:59:18] <sheldonh> i can live with the delay. just smells like i'm doing something wrong, since there are only... 22 sortables on the page i'm playing with
[11:59:49] <Eviltwin> ...
[11:59:56] <kborchers> 22 items or 22 lists? 22 lists would be a lot
[11:59:58] <Eviltwin> Why are there 22 sortables on the page you are playing with?
[12:00:01] <Eviltwin> And why are they all connected
[12:00:07] <kborchers> and sounds unusable
[12:00:30] <jedimind> 22 lists of 2 items each
[12:00:31] <jedimind> :)
[12:00:34] <sheldonh> it's a checklist of concerns, and concerns can be nested
[12:01:08] <sheldonh> i could do magic to exclude concerns that don't have any nested concerns yet
[12:01:19] <sheldonh> that would bring this page down to 5 sortables
[12:01:26] <Eviltwin> This sounds like a mess
[12:02:08] <sheldonh> Eviltwin: well i'm pretty proud of it. nested checklists have been something i've wanted to implement for ages, and it's worked out pretty well so far :)
[12:03:08] <sheldonh> perhaps i should be using draggable and droppable instead of sortable?
[12:04:32] <Sean-Der> Is it possible to use a .val against a bunch of concated strings?
[12:04:50] <Sean-Der> ('My' + 'Selector').val()
[12:04:50] <Eviltwin> Sean-Der: What?
[12:05:12] <Sean-Der> Eviltwin: ('My' + 'Selector').val()
[12:05:35] <Eviltwin> Not $("My" + "Selector")?
[12:06:07] <Sean-Der> Oh maybe that is my issue
[12:06:12] <Eviltwin> :P
[12:06:16] <Sean-Der> I am putting the ''$ inside the brackets
[12:06:23] <Sean-Der> Hahah thanks :p
[12:06:28] <Eviltwin> Someone doesn't understand how JavaScript or jQuery works
[12:06:55] <Sean-Der> I am having code coma I am writing too much today and going to quickly
[12:08:59] <Eviltwin> w/e
[12:12:22] <sheldonh> LOL i see what you guys meant. dunno how i ended up thinking every bloody concern needed to be a sortable! dropped the selector class from the template that gets copied to make new concerns, and it still works, now without connectWith and without stalling. thanks for the LART, much appreciated
[12:14:00] <sheldonh> toggleClass()   *swoon*
[12:30:46] <notbenh> hello all I have what I'm guessing is a scope issue, I want to be able to take the results of $.ajax and create attributes of them in the current object: https://gist.github.com/1515279
[12:31:26] <notbenh> I was hoping that the async:false thing would allow me to keep scope, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Is there a way to do this?
[12:31:41] <Eviltwin> notbenh: Don't use async false
[12:31:59] <xrated> notbenh, if you want to assign the data to the Thing.user object just call it explicitly inside the ajax callback
[12:32:19] <notbenh> xrated: will that then apply to the class or the instance?
[12:32:43] <Eviltwin> notbenh: I think this is what you wanted: https://gist.github.com/1515285
[12:32:44] <notbenh> ie: var me = Thing.user.new('notbenh'); me._fetch_user_data();
[12:33:18] <notbenh> Eviltwin: ahh... so I do need to scope this.
[12:33:24] <notbenh> very handy thanks
[13:14:35] <sheldonh> is there a way to specify items in a sortable that you're not allowed to drag another item after?
[13:19:14] <Eviltwin> sheldonh: Don't think it's designed for stuff like that
[13:19:53] <sheldonh> Eviltwin: cool, if i'm not missing out, i don't mind :)
[13:21:34] <sheldonh> i'm going to put placeholders in items that don't have nested items, and then use start and stop events to add/remove placeholders as appropriate
[13:23:30] <sheldonh> is there an easy way to access the parent element that the item was dragged from, in the stop callback? otherwiseif not, i'll need to attach it to the item as data() in the start callback
[13:24:42] <sc0ttkclark_away> anyone ever see jQuery slide* functions do a little bungee effect? i was expecting it to start and stop at the real height of the container, but it over extends a little and bounces back like a browser glitch or something
[13:25:34] <Eviltwin> sc0ttkclark_away: Code?
[13:26:14] <Eviltwin> sc0ttkclark_away: Have you looked at the easings? http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/easing.html
[13:26:17] <Eviltwin> From jQuery UI
[13:27:34] <sc0ttkclark_away> Eviltwin: i'm not looking for it to bungee, i only needed it linear, but that's not the problem either, it looks like it over extends
[13:27:46] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ sc0ttkclark_away
[13:27:47] <bot-t> sc0ttkclark_away, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[13:28:10] <sc0ttkclark_away> unfortunately it's a little deep into my project, but the basis of the code is: $el.slideDown();
[13:28:22] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ sc0ttkclark_away
[13:28:22] <bot-t> sc0ttkclark_away, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[13:28:24] <sc0ttkclark_away> which is the problem, it's so basic, it's gotta be something someone else has run across
[13:28:39] <sc0ttkclark_away> hmm let me see if i can manage that, lots of external assets
[13:28:44] <Eviltwin> So it only happens in your super particular situation?
[13:28:53] <Eviltwin> Sounds like it's other code that's the problem then
[13:29:24] <sumeetjain> I have this string: '[{"errors":[{"1":["Length must be a number."],"2":["Name cannot be blank."]}]}]'. It's been returned to me from the server. I'd like to loop through it and alert out the messages. I'm having a hard time getting to the messages in the loop. I tried parsing as JSON with $.parseJSON, but I can never seem to get to the actual messages.
[13:30:25] <Eviltwin> sc0ttkclark_away: Why aren't you using an array for the errors? http://json.org/
[13:30:54] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ sc0ttkclark_away
[13:30:54] <bot-t> sc0ttkclark_away, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[13:31:44] <Eviltwin> This is over 570K of code
[13:31:45] <sc0ttkclark_away> using the jsfiddle link i sent, you should be able to see the page i'm referring to
[13:31:46] <Eviltwin> I'm not reading this
[13:31:47] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[13:31:50] <sc0ttkclark_away> no not reading
[13:31:52] <sc0ttkclark_away> just seeing what happens
[13:31:57] <sc0ttkclark_away> click edit on any of hte fields
[13:32:04] <sc0ttkclark_away> in the field type drop-down select relationship
[13:32:13] <sc0ttkclark_away> you'll see the two fields below do a slideDown
[13:32:25] <sc0ttkclark_away> and it glitches
[13:32:47] <sc0ttkclark_away> i really came in here to see if anyone has seen something like that happen before, not to have anyone debug it
[13:33:15] <Eviltwin> Everything looks find here
[13:33:20] <Eviltwin> Not sure what you're talking about
[13:34:50] <sc0ttkclark_away> i just slowed down the slideDown to 10000
[13:34:57] <sc0ttkclark_away> i can see now what it does
[13:35:02] <sc0ttkclark_away> lemme screenshot it
[13:35:37] <sc0ttkclark_away> http://grab.by/bshc
[13:35:55] <sc0ttkclark_away> so it ends up doubling the height, then quickly snapping back to the visible hight
[13:35:58] <sc0ttkclark_away> height*
[13:36:04] <sc0ttkclark_away> running chrome
[13:36:20] <sc0ttkclark_away> thx for your help anyway, looks like i've got a lot more digging to do
[13:51:04] <monstaRtruck> hallow!
[13:51:08] <monstaRtruck> ummm
[13:51:20] <monstaRtruck> im trying to have a zoom to mouse position

[13:55:48] <iateadonut> what is $this id?
[13:56:08] <iateadonut> (i'm just trying to run a function that alerts the id of the checkbox that was just changed)
[13:56:22] <Eviltwin> ?eval $this

[14:00:52] <xrated> ##php
[14:00:59] <sc0ttkclark_away> lol
[14:01:06] <Eviltwin> :P
[14:01:14] <Eviltwin> "programming theory"

[14:02:27] <monstaRtruck> no
[14:02:35] <monstaRtruck> im trying to zoom to cursor
[14:02:57] <Eviltwin> What do you think "programming theory" means?
[14:06:36] <xarxer> If I want content to be shown upon the press of a button, is it best to take it from a page which outputs it via php's "echo"-function, or is it possible to call a page with a php-function that returns a string?
[14:07:47] <Eviltwin> xarxer: No
[14:10:11] <zulax> is there a better way to do .html('<img src=".... ?
[14:10:19] <zulax> i think i am having issues with chrome
[14:11:01] <RLa> something like $('<img/>', { src: '...' })?
[14:11:18] <Eviltwin> Well rather than $('<img src="image.php" class="foobar">') You can do $("<img>",{src:"image.php",class:"foobar"})
[14:11:27] <Eviltwin> Which I find more readable when you space it out
[14:11:40] <Eviltwin> Obviously not going to space it out here
[14:12:19] <zulax> is it img or img/
[14:12:31] <Eviltwin> zulax: jQuery doesn't care
[14:13:02] <rubynfootball> how can I get the value of a select element on page load?
[14:13:34] <Eviltwin> $(window).load(function(){alert($("{select selector}").val())});
[14:14:03] <rubynfootball> Eviltwin;  sry, rather the value of a radio buctton on page load?
[14:14:09] <zulax> Eviltwin, is it $("id").html("<img>", { .....     ?cause i see $("<img
[14:14:14] <Eviltwin> $(window).load(function(){alert($("{radio button selector}").val())});
[14:14:35] <Eviltwin> zulax: $("id").html($("<img>",{...}));
[14:19:43] <zulax> well, when seeing the firebug i get the same output for img tag in FF and Chromium, but the image is shown only in FF
[14:19:59] <zulax> what could be wrong?
[14:20:13] <Eviltwin> Does Chromium have a debugger?
[14:21:08] <astropirate> Eviltwin, does it ever?
[14:21:31] <Eviltwin> What?
[14:21:41] <astropirate> Eviltwin, thats a positive
[14:21:43] <zulax> it does
[14:21:49] <zulax> ctrl+shift+J
[14:22:03] <Eviltwin> zulax: Use that to see if it's loading the image and if so, what its loading
[14:22:09] <nickdc> I'm getting an ajaxError but it actually successfully makes the request and gets the correct response code back. The body doesn't come back from the request. any ideas why I may be running into this?
[14:22:15] <zulax> Eviltwin, it loads the image in the DOm, but i cant see it
[14:22:25] <zulax> it loads the image, then i have an alert
[14:22:29] <Eviltwin> Check the Resources
[14:22:38] <Eviltwin> And see if it loads the image correctly
[14:23:46] <zulax> is Resources supposed to be dynamic like Elements?
[14:23:53] <zulax> nothing happens in resource
[14:25:09] <rubynfootball> Eviltwin:  I tried this;  $(window).load(function(){alert(#company_type).val()});  but it does nothing.  btw, company_type is the id of the select element I am trying to get the value of
[14:25:29] <rubynfootball> Eviltwin:  any idea on what I'm doing wrong??
[14:25:53] <zulax> rubynfootball,  "#company_type" ?
[14:26:26] <Eviltwin> rubynfootball: Many, many things
[14:26:39] <Eviltwin> Copy what I wrote and then make the change
[14:26:44] <Eviltwin> You just...fucked up all over the place
[14:27:36] <zulax> WTH, i clicked on network debug options on chromium and the image shows up!
[14:28:02] <zulax> but when i click somewhere else, the image isnt there
[14:29:02] <iateadonut> if an element has two classes, how can i show them?
[14:29:10] <Eviltwin> What?
[14:29:41] <rubynfootball> Eviltwin:  I just trieed this:  $(window).load(function(){alert($("{company_type}").val())});  and it still doesn't work.  Can you please help me figure out what I am doing wrong
[14:30:20] <Eviltwin> #company_type instead of {company_type}
[14:32:31] <zulax> so i narrowed my problem to this
[14:32:46] <zulax> I have 1) load img 2) alert 3) remove image
[14:32:59] <zulax> this squesnce works fine on FF but not on chromium!
[14:33:23] <Eviltwin> Wait
[14:33:28] <Eviltwin> Like add(); alert(); remove(); ?
[14:33:44] <zulax> img src = :something, alert, img src=nothing
[14:34:03] <Eviltwin> Why are you alerting?
[14:34:24] <zulax> they click on something, i show image, alert(reason), remove image
[14:34:40] <Eviltwin> So you're using alert to communicate with the user?
[14:34:45] <zulax> i dont like i am using alert
[14:35:09] <Eviltwin> alert shouldn't really use used any more
[14:35:15] <zulax> dialog box?
[14:35:27] <rubynfootball> Eviltwin:  I changed it to:  $(window).load(function(){alert($(".ctype").val())}); but I'm still not getting anything to alert
[14:35:32] <Eviltwin> It should be done in HTML if you want to do it
[14:35:41] <rubynfootball> any idea what I'm doing wrong?

[14:42:23] <someprimetime> does appendTo not work in IE?
[14:43:04] <ahandy> question, how i select ALL the children inside a div?
[14:45:51] <zulax> jquery ui is kinda confsing, i download the entire thing and included the jquery-ui/js/jquery-ui.....js
[14:46:13] <zulax> doesnt that include the js files in development/ui/  ?

[14:57:38] <Spuddy> My problem is the Featured section.
[14:57:51] <Spuddy> I want to click Peacemaking and have the first slider fadeOut.
[14:58:29] <Spuddy> I tried simply having it alert on click and nothing.
[15:09:58] <simoon> hi everyone
[15:10:12] <simoon> I was wondering if it was possible to overlap textareas
[15:13:23] <rockfruit> Hello, how can I 'normalize' a string (ie, make it fit for being an ID or a filename) - remove whitespace/specials or so, and quote html chars.  is there a jquery shortcut for this one?
[15:15:49] <simoon> rockfruit: not that I've found, but maybe this will help http://hastebin.com/WqO6ZsicMG.js
[15:16:55] <rockfruit> yip i can work with that thanks
[15:17:13] <simoon> lol yipyip is my canv.as name... you tripped me out
[15:17:26] <simoon> glad I could help
[15:17:58] <rockfruit> round here yipkop = yes
[15:18:06] <rubynfootball> why do these lines of code:  $("#company_company_type_1").click(function(){alert('test');}); give me an unexpected end of input error?
[15:19:04] <rubynfootball> Eviltwin:  ^
[15:19:04] <rockfruit> paste a few lines of context?
[15:19:23] <solidus-river> how would you recommend making a docked area draggable, ie, the user could click on the top and pull it up / down. This would modify the height attritubets of the relevant divs
[15:22:05] <rubynfootball> rockfruit:  here is a js fiddle of a little of what I'm trying to do:  http://jsfiddle.net/utcFR/1/
[15:24:43] <rubynfootball> rockfruit:  based on the plan selected, I want to hide/show the storage option, but I currently keep getting an unexpected end of input when the page loads
[15:29:04] <rockfruit> jsfiddle and I are at odds like this.  If I take your js code and throw it in <script> tag, it works? i updated fiddle
[15:29:26] <rockfruit> second time today I find I can't make that js panel work - have to use inline script tag
[15:30:01] <rockfruit> so your code is fine something else nearby is flying out of formation tho
[15:30:29] <rockfruit> could have been your window.onload
[15:30:48] <rockfruit> I've never used that
[15:33:13] <fotoflo> hi all. I'm trying to manipulate $("#id").css("width");    do i  have to do a substring and then convert to an int to work with this or is there a better way?
[15:33:59] <Rembane> $('#id').width();
[15:34:36] <solidus-river> i seem to have found ui.resizable() :) MY PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED
[15:34:37] <fotoflo> Rembane: THanks!
[15:36:03] <Rembane> fotoflo: np
[15:58:31] <rubynfootball> why would I get un unexpected identifier for the following line?  if($(#storage:visible)){$('#storage').hide()};
[16:00:45] <simoon> rubynfootball: $(#storage:visible)
[16:00:51] <simoon> are you missing quotes?
[16:01:07] <rubynfootball> simoon:  tnx

[16:02:07] <bot-t> rubynfootball, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[16:35:48] <Eviltwin> Christ, I didn't realize how vocal I've been since I got here
[16:36:43] <Eviltwin> I've sent about 11,000 messages, aaronmcadam's sent about 10,000, ajpiano's ent about 8500, and coldhead's sent about 8000
[16:36:55] <ajpiano> since when :p
[16:37:27] <Eviltwin> Only since July
[16:37:49] <ajpiano> yeah you have been repping it pretty hard :)
[16:38:13] <Eviltwin> Ran out of TV to watch :P
[16:38:19] <Eviltwin> Needed a distraction
[16:40:07] <ajpiano> you picked well
[16:41:44] <someprimetime> is appendTo not supported for IE?
[16:41:51] <Eviltwin> What?
[16:42:09] <Eviltwin> Should be fine everywhere
[16:42:18] <Eviltwin> Are you using it backwards?
[16:42:34] <Eviltwin> That throws people
[16:42:44] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: not that I'm aware of. i'll post the jsfiddle up in a sec
[16:42:48] <someprimetime> need to switch back to that branch
[16:42:52] <Eviltwin> Well I'm just about to head out
[16:43:03] <someprimetime> ok maybe someone else can have a look @ it
[16:49:42] <pimperle> hi
[16:49:58] <pimperle> is there a difference between $.event and $.Event?
[16:50:24] <pimperle> i found $.Event in the docs, but one example for global events used $.event.trigger and i'm curious what the difference is
[16:50:40] <pimperle> however i could not find $.event in the documentation
[16:51:48] <xarxer> Why doesn't "click()" work for <a> elements?
[16:58:17] <simoon> xarxer: if someone could answer "why" would that even help you?
[16:59:12] <simoon> I'm going to help anyway ;)
[16:59:27] <ajpiano> pimperle: $.Event is the constructor for making jQuery's event object
[16:59:40] <simoon> <a href='http://poop.poo' onclick='......
[16:59:58] <ajpiano> jQuery.event is just an object on window.jQuery where most of the functions for event manipulation exist
[17:00:08] <pimperle> ah, thanks
[17:00:10] <ajpiano> is there really an example in the docs that uses $.event.trigger? it shouldn't
[17:01:01] <enerel> when assining another iframe src $(".ytvid").attr('src',link); why it does not work?
[17:04:57] <RedFox2> hey
[17:06:13] <RedFox2> I'm adding items to a ul as <li><a data-id="xyz" class="removeitem">value</a> and if I want to hook $('a.removeitem') it does not register in jquery. Any idea? =)
[17:06:24] <RedFox2> (+ </li>, missed it)
[17:07:29] <simoon> hi RedFox you might want to look at http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:08:14] <RedFox2> simoon, would you please take a look if I paste it into jsfiddle? =)
[17:08:48] <simoon> RedFox2: yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa :)
[17:08:53] <enerel> when assining another iframe src $(".ytvid").attr('src',link); why it does not work?
[17:10:51] <RedFox2> simoon, thx, here: http://jsfiddle.net/xEb2w/
[17:11:29] <RedFox2> I actually want to remove li, I guess that can be done with $(this).parent.remove(); ?
[17:11:50] <RedFox2> but I can alert("hi"); and it doesnt "hi" :(
[17:12:20] <simoon> OK I'll look right now
[17:12:24] <RedFox2> thx
[17:13:28] <nocturne7> is anybody using the 'dropkick' select box library? I am getting this error when I include the file "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dropkick'

[17:14:37] <simoon> RedFox2: I've never used fiddle before... can you see my changes? or do I need to fork?
[17:14:52] <simoon> or wait... share?
[17:14:53] <RedFox2> you need to click "update" then give me the new paste
[17:15:03] <simoon> http://jsfiddle.net/xEb2w/1/
[17:15:40] <RedFox2> thx simoon, but why do I need live and not just click?
[17:15:46] <RedFox2> This confuses me
[17:15:50] <simoon> I can sort of explain it:
[17:16:19] <RedFox2> When I add dynamically items and want to do stuff on them I need live, if they're from start on there I need just .handler ?
[17:16:20] <simoon> when you do the .append
[17:16:27] <simoon> yes
[17:16:38] <simoon> because of ... here lol
[17:16:44] <simoon> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[17:16:47] <RedFox2> ok, is this a new change or did I missed it?
[17:16:51] <simoon> they use technical terms
[17:16:55] <simoon> I'm not smart with that ;)
[17:17:26] <RedFox2> I'm wondering if I am on the safe side if I'm only use .live ?!!?!?!? ;)
[17:18:45] <simoon> Safety is an illusion, but the breast will be ever comforting
[17:19:11] <RedFox2> haha - anyway you helped me, thx

[17:22:37] <fotoflo> console.log("clicked "+ this.id.substring(this.id.length-1, this.id.length));
[17:22:43] <fotoflo> is there a better way to do this?
[17:24:14] <fotoflo> (that console log is inside an on-click binding)
[17:32:38] <ch3mical> ?p @ fotoflo
[17:32:39] <bot-t> fotoflo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:48:04] <surfdue> ch3mical: who were you posting that for
[17:48:05] <surfdue> :P
[17:48:49] <surfdue> I am making my first plugin because I think I need to organize my code into one js file, instead of per page.. What is the best method of detecting the url and running the proper script?
[17:49:19] <surfdue> I could use hashes, and execute a certain function just not sure exactly how to go about this.. I am on the plugins/authoring page now.
[17:49:40] <surfdue> More of the best way to go about it, not necesarrily how.
[17:51:09] <nocturne7> what select box plugin do you guys recommend ?
[17:51:21] <nocturne7> I think uniform looks good
[17:52:20] <muhoo> what's the difference between $(function() {  and function($) { ?
[17:52:20] <surfdue> oh gosh select boxes...
[17:52:31] <surfdue> the second isnt jquery muhoo
[17:52:54] <muhoo> really? i've seen it that way before
[17:53:17] <surfdue> well I mean if jquery is preloaded then technically your passing in jquery to the function
[17:53:18] <muhoo> in fact, i have working code using it
[17:53:23] <surfdue> its a bad way of doing it -.-
[17:53:37] <ajpiano> surfdue: what
[17:53:37] <muhoo> oh, ok. thanks
[17:53:40] <ajpiano> no it isn't
[17:53:43] <surfdue> muhoo: np :)
[17:53:51] <muhoo> yii appears to do it that way
[17:53:51] <ajpiano> (function($) { })(jQuery) is a very common pattern
[17:54:08] <ajpiano> nocturne7: also take a look at chosen
[17:54:09] <surfdue> ajpiano: i didnt see the (jQuery) after his example :P
[17:54:24] <muhoo> i also see this: jQuery(function($) {}
[17:54:28] <ajpiano> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[17:54:30] <muhoo> which makes my hair stand on end, it's so ugly
[17:54:41] <surfdue> muhoo: yikes.. :P
[17:54:45] <ajpiano> muhoo: a reference to jQuery is passed in to the document ready handler
[17:54:51] <surfdue> muhoo: sorry technially the answer is they both work fine. :P
[17:54:57] <ajpiano> $(document).ready(function($) { });  jQuery(function($) {})
[17:55:18] <surfdue> ajpiano: i like this plugin thanks for linking :)
[17:55:49] <surfdue> ajpiano: do you know if chosen supports ajax calls for the multi selects off hand?
[17:55:56] <ajpiano> what
[17:56:24] <muhoo>  so $(document).ready() is an alias for jQuery()
[17:56:39] <surfdue> for example I do not want to list all my options with code, can I pull them in with ajax?
[17:56:46] <surfdue> list in html*
[17:56:49] <ajpiano> jQuery(function() {}) is an alias for jQuery(document).ready( function() });
[17:56:58] <ajpiano> surfdue: assuming you transform it into a select before calling the plugin it would work
[17:57:03] <ajpiano> alright folks i'm out, good luck
[17:57:41] <surfdue> ajpiano: darn i wanted your feedback on my function question
[17:57:41] <surfdue> :(
[17:57:52] <muhoo> cool. so how is that different from $(function(){}) ?
[17:58:04] <muhoo> or is it identical?
[17:58:25] <nocturne7> ajpiano: choosen is awesome
[17:58:30] <nocturne7> I am already using it
[17:59:04] <surfdue> nocturne7: agreed where have I been.. :P (where is the checkbox support) lol
[17:59:18] <muhoo> so wait,  $(function(){}) is the same as jQuery(function() {}) which is the same as jQuery(document).ready( function() }); ?
[17:59:21] <muhoo> but what about jQuery(function($) {}) ?
[17:59:26] * muhoo is getting more confused the more he looks at this
[17:59:29] <surfdue> nocturne7: notice if they include theme options for all fields so I can make them match?
[17:59:49] <surfdue> muhoo: no dont use on ready unless you want to wait for the window to completely load first.
[18:00:09] <nocturne7> dropkick is not working for me properly
[18:00:56] <nocturne7> I am getting this "$('.default').dropkick(); " unless Include the file from github instead of from my local hdd
[18:01:08] <nocturne7> "$(".default").dropkick is not a function"
[18:01:18] <surfdue> is it loaded?
[18:01:34] <surfdue> nocturne7: what browser do you use?
[18:01:40] <nocturne7> firefox and chrome
[18:02:00] <surfdue> in chrome open the dev toolbar (cmd + i on mac) and check the network tab
[18:02:14] <surfdue> see the file being loaded? (after jquery)
[18:02:50] <nocturne7> surfdue: I think it is loaded before jquery
[18:03:33] <nocturne7> surfue: full error message from chrome http://pastebin.com/sWELEvzr
[18:03:36] <surfdue> thats the problem, jquery needs to be in the head before every other js file using it
[18:06:08] <muhoo> so wait. is $(document).ready(function($) { }); the same as  jQuery(document).ready( function() }); ?
[18:06:38] <muhoo> but then what does $(function() {}) do that's different? or is it the same?
[18:06:45] <ajpiano> they are all identical
[18:07:20] <nocturne7> surfdue: my bad, it is being loaded after the jquery
[18:07:26] <muhoo> so why would people use all these different variations?
[18:07:30] <muhoo> it's crazy-making
[18:07:38] <muhoo> $(function() {}) is nice and clean though.
[18:07:42] <ajpiano> muhoo: because they aren't "variations"
[18:07:45] <ajpiano> jQuery  == $
[18:07:47] <surfdue> ajpiano: your still here?
[18:07:58] <ajpiano> and the ready function gets jQuery as an argument
[18:08:04] <ajpiano> whether or not you actually list it in the function arguments
[18:08:04] <nocturne7> surfdue: all other js libraries I am using are being written into this "include.js"
[18:08:09] <surfdue> muhoo: i prefer $.(function(){});
[18:08:10] <nocturne7> which is included after jquery
[18:08:11] <muhoo> ajpiano: AHA! thanks
[18:08:19] <ajpiano> surfdue: no, i'm not
[18:08:41] <surfdue> ajpiano: damn you ... :P id love your advice too you know
[18:08:42] <muhoo> $.(function(){}) not $(function() {}) ?
[18:08:43] <ajpiano> surfdue: i lack the mental facilities at the moment to give you sufficient guidance
[18:08:55] <surfdue> ajpiano: true.
[18:10:43] <surfdue> i guess ill just create funtions inside of funtions inside of baby functions.
[18:10:46] <muhoo> so if i were doing $(window).bind(), do i need to wrap that in a $.(function() { $(window).bind()}) ?
[18:11:14] <muhoo> or just throw that into a <script></script> tag anywhere?
[18:11:58] <nocturne7> do you guys like coffeescript ?
[18:12:38] <CantUnplug> i dont..  but i like to write js..
[18:13:05] <surfdue> heh
[18:13:19] <surfdue> muhoo: i think either would work
[18:14:41] <muhoo> but which is correct?
[18:15:04] <muhoo> also, what is the difference between $(function() {}) and $.(function(){}) ?
[18:16:30] <surfdue> muhoo: I was previously responding, but I cant answer your questions as im not an expert. My guess is to try both and then check your execution time?
[18:17:20] <muhoo> hmm $.(function(){}) appears to be illegal
[18:17:25] <muhoo> so that answers that questino
[18:17:41] * surfdue shrugs
[18:18:06] <muhoo> the apathetic leading the stupid :-)
[18:18:41] <muhoo> well i think i understand this a little better now. thanks.
[18:18:54] <surfdue> i have concern for you, I just dunno how to help
[18:19:00] <surfdue> I have obv. given you bad information so far. :P
[18:19:14] <surfdue> muhoo: ask me a php question :)
[18:19:16] <muhoo> it's ok. the internet has given me bad info before
[18:19:35] <surfdue> good thing im not part of that
[18:19:54] <CantUnplug> jQuery(document).ready() is same as $(document).ready... the $ is shorthand like <?=$var;?>... use jQuery() is you are on wordpress or anywhere there might be a conflict with another lib
[18:20:19] <CantUnplug> when jQuery loads it assigns an instance of iteself to the $ variable.
[18:20:27] <CantUnplug> thats it..  just shortcut for typing
[18:23:12] <CantUnplug> if you need jQuery()... you can force it in your loader..  jQuery(document).ready(function($){ //do your stuff here with shorthand });
[18:28:10] <surfdue> Sorry.. I just had a pissing fit with my ISP on twitter..
[18:28:22] <CantUnplug> clean your screen
[18:28:23] <surfdue> CantUnplug: did you respond? :)
[18:28:34] <surfdue> Lulz.. I did, with my tongue.
[18:28:35] <CantUnplug> yeah, scroll up
[18:29:03] <surfdue> CantUnplug: even though I was here, I really wasnt I was disconncted from the bouncer.
[18:29:05] <surfdue> I was bounced. :P
[18:29:24] <CantUnplug> jQuery(document).ready() is same as $(document).ready... the $ is shorthand like <?=$var;?>... use jQuery() is you are on wordpress or anywhere there might be a conflict with another lib
[18:29:53] <CantUnplug> when jQuery loads it assigns an instance of iteself to the $ variable.  thats it..  just shortcut for typing if you need jQuery()... you can force it in your loader..  jQuery(document).ready(function($){ //do your stuff here with shorthand });
[18:29:56] <surfdue> oh I saw that & knew that my bad
[18:31:13] <surfdue> I am making my first plugin because I think I need to organize my code into one js file, instead of per page.. What is the best method of detecting the url and running the proper script? I could use a hash plugin to monitor then execute a certain function based off that. Just not sure exactly the best way to go about this.. I am on the plugins/authoring page now.
[18:31:21] <surfdue> ^^ CantUnplug helpies?
[18:32:13] <CantUnplug> Usually, I oad my plugins then have an init.js that binds all the bits..
[18:32:25] <CantUnplug> like a construct function
[18:32:56] <CantUnplug> in my framework/templating system, i actually build all the seperated js files based on url ..
[18:33:02] <CantUnplug> but thats all cserverside
[18:33:04] <surfdue> CantUnplug: can you provide an example? I do this with php on my framework using a "boot" constructor but not really sure the best way to do this with js
[18:33:52] <surfdue> like on plugins/authoring page, how can I call a method function from another method?
[18:33:53] <CantUnplug> $(document).ready....   $('.slidetoggle').livequery()...
[18:34:59] <CantUnplug> once you convert an elemnent with a plugin, you should be able to interact with it by its variable/reference.
[18:35:43] <CantUnplug> unless you are talking about namespacing
[18:36:14] <CantUnplug> var mycompany = {};  mycompany.mystuff = {}  etc... then you can call from anywhere
[18:36:46] <surfdue> CantUnplug: its all quite confusing i guess i need a specific example before i ask
[18:36:54] <surfdue> im just not digging the js on each page. :P
[18:37:36] <surfdue> what happens if I create a standard function inside of a (function( $ ){})( jQuery ); will it still be accessible?
[18:37:40] <surfdue> javascript function*
[18:37:53] <CantUnplug> in my tmplate system.  i load the dependant js in module js files, it gets compiled down as needed
[18:38:01] <CantUnplug> of course
[18:38:19] <surfdue> but only within the jquery function or also external?
[18:38:20] <CantUnplug> as long as the function is loaded before you call it..
[18:38:22] <surfdue> aka scope
[18:38:26] <surfdue> ok
[18:38:27] <CantUnplug> anywhere on the dom
[18:38:52] <surfdue> so its not like php , inside of the jquery method I dont need to run like $this.function()
[18:39:01] <CantUnplug> that what namespaces are awseome for.. make a file of functions (assumign not a plugin)..  and call it yourcompany.library.checkDate() etc..
[18:39:07] <CantUnplug> you can load once and have it forever
[18:39:36] <CantUnplug> then application specific stuff (things you wouldnt reuse) .. yourcompany.productname.verySpecificToProjectFunction
[18:40:13] <CantUnplug> no.. only in plugins
[18:40:16] <surfdue> CantUnplug: so your suggestion i dont use methods?
[18:40:19] <CantUnplug> where its an 'instance''
[18:40:22] <instanceoftom> can anyone recommend an image gallery?
[18:40:40] <surfdue> CantUnplug: oh. So I shouldnt make this a jquery plugin?
[18:40:47] <CantUnplug> there ar eno real classes in js.. so no methods per say.. only
[18:41:23] <CantUnplug> you could.. i make a mental differentition of a plugin for reusable 'things' like...  $('.clickAlerts).clickAlert();
[18:41:33] <CantUnplug> to convert one thing into an 'instance' of a plugin
[18:41:41] <CantUnplug> otherwise its just standard library of helper funcitons
[18:42:05] <surfdue> for example i have flash messages loading on every page they are just functions containg jquery like showMessage etc
[18:42:13] <surfdue> should this be made into a plugin?
[18:42:17] <CantUnplug> right.. so make a flashmessage plugin..
[18:42:24] <CantUnplug> or better yet.. go grab one.. there are tons
[18:42:33] <surfdue> ya but i wrote this :p
[18:42:42] <CantUnplug> you load the message in a <div class='flashmessage'>Message Here..
[18:42:43] <surfdue> do you suggest any specifically?
[18:42:50] <CantUnplug> css hides it..
[18:43:09] <CantUnplug> but yor init turns all .flashMessages into a flash message object
[18:43:10] <surfdue> Ya I do that all with php, then js  loops and intiates
[18:43:15] <CantUnplug> that fades in.. etc..
[18:43:42] <surfdue> my function is pretty specific it shows the messages under my header and moves the content down. Showing multiple ones pushes one under each adding to the padding between header and content
[18:43:50] <CantUnplug> ... if you are writign the same code more than once.. you need to turn it into a plugin (in a perfect world)
[18:43:51] <surfdue> do you have any suggestions for flash plugins?
[18:44:03] <surfdue> well technically im not, its only loaded one.. :P
[18:44:14] <surfdue> ya i guess your right...
[18:44:36] <surfdue> ill just use that namespace stuff.. like Site.jiggle.puff()
[18:44:54] <surfdue> jiggle being the "class" and puff being the "action"
[18:45:04] <CantUnplug> http://www.plumtheory.com/demos/notification-center/light/
[18:45:11] <CantUnplug> switch demo to growl
[18:45:18] <ch3mical> I ran 'du -h ~' and it's been going for over 6 mins -_-
[18:45:26] <CantUnplug> .. check out his code and see how he is doign it.. - i havnt checked, just found first example
[18:45:34] <ch3mical> Sorry, kind of off topic :p
[18:45:35] <surfdue> CantUnplug: i broke it already :O
[18:45:41] <surfdue> CantUnplug: you cant show multiple ones :(
[18:45:53] <surfdue> ch3mical: lol
[18:46:17] <CantUnplug> surfdude.. change it to 'growl'
[18:46:21] <CantUnplug> it pushes up
[18:46:30] <CantUnplug> he made a ntoficationcenter plugin
[18:46:52] <surfdue> teehee
[18:47:02] <surfdue> CantUnplug: hmm
[18:47:06] <ch3mical> omg finally finished
[18:47:10] <surfdue> with?
[18:56:46] <MysterOnyx> Could someone eyeball this code? For some reason, jplayer is playing both sounds in the first player instead of in the first and second. I'm asking in here because the error may be a simple jquery issue. Here's the code output: view-source:http://mysteronyx.com/new_audio/testjp.php
[18:57:53] <enerel> when assining iframe src $(".ytvid").attr('src',link); why it does not work?
[19:32:59] <surfdue> CantUnplug: how do I do those namespaces im trying to do var message.type = 'test'; and its giving me a execpected identifier
[19:33:45] <ch3mical> surfdue: is message already defined as an object?
[19:37:27] <surfdue> ch3mical: yes var message = {}
[19:38:08] <ch3mical> ?p @ surfdue
[19:38:09] <bot-t> surfdue, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:38:48] <surfdue> oh nvm one of the message objects had a var infront -.-
[19:39:00] <ch3mical> ...
[19:40:49] <ch3mical> So what are you working on anyway (bored while waiting for files to copy)
[19:41:42] <surfdue> ch3mical: a cloud editor for developers
[19:41:53] <ch3mical> o_O
[19:42:00] <surfdue> o.O
[19:42:06] <ch3mical> There are tons of those already
[19:42:10] <surfdue> so
[19:42:15] <ch3mical> *shrug*
[19:42:20] <ch3mical> Whatever makes you happy :)
[19:42:22] <surfdue> none of the ones I have seen are worth my time
[19:42:31] <surfdue> cloud9 for example is expensive..
[19:42:42] <surfdue> and really really beta even though beta isnt mentioned
[19:42:43] <ch3mical> Cloud9IDE is free...
[19:42:56] <surfdue> not for private stuff
[19:43:04] <ch3mical> Yes, it is
[19:43:07] <surfdue> http://c9.io/pricing.html
[19:43:11] <surfdue> 15/mo
[19:43:35] <ch3mical> That's not Cloud9IDE you're paying for
[19:43:57] <ch3mical> The IDE is free, you're talking about project hosting
[19:44:04] <surfdue> ey?
[19:44:24] <ch3mical> Forget it
[19:44:35] <ch3mical> So what language is your IDE for?
[19:44:51] <surfdue> wow their site sucks look at the thing on the right
[19:44:57] <surfdue> u cant click it to get it
[19:45:05] <surfdue> ch3mical: anything you want
[19:45:06] <surfdue> :)
[19:45:35] <ekz> hi all
[19:45:52] <surfdue> hi ekz
[19:45:54] <ch3mical> Hey, check this out, I just wrote a code editor in HTML5: data:text/html;<div contentEditable>
[19:46:04] <ekz> hey surfdue
[19:46:14] <ch3mical> It supports every language
[19:46:18] <ch3mical> ;)
[19:46:21] <ekz> havent dabbled in jquery in like years...
[19:46:31] <ch3mical> Years? Wow
[19:46:31] <surfdue> its only been out for years
[19:46:33] <surfdue> ;P jk
[19:46:36] <ekz> lol
[19:46:36] <ch3mical> Lots has changed
[19:46:38] <ch3mical> lol
[19:46:38] <ekz> yeah.
[19:46:42] <ekz> it was 2006
[19:46:44] <ekz> it was a baby
[19:46:46] <ekz> it is way different now
[19:46:54] <ch3mical> Indeed
[19:47:00] <surfdue> whats that
[19:47:03] <ch3mical> Didn't it debut in 06?
[19:47:18] <ekz> yup
[19:47:24] <ekz> thats the only reason why i dabbled in it
[19:47:29] <ch3mical> heh
[19:47:30] <ekz> "whats this new cool thing:
[19:47:32] <ekz> "
[19:47:47] <ekz> and it was pretty cool, but i got back to work on what put food on the table : actionscript
[19:47:47] <surfdue> now the cool new thing has you wondering why your using mootools
[19:47:59] <ekz> yeah and this mootools business
[19:48:01] <ekz> confusing as well.
[19:48:04] <surfdue> :P
[19:48:06] <ekz> heh heh
[19:48:17] <ekz> now i am an adobe guy, so I heard about edge, and that seems cool
[19:48:17] <surfdue> actionscript can produce food?
[19:48:23] <ekz> seems to include jquery libs
[19:48:27] <ekz> in a wysiwyg editor
[19:48:32] <surfdue> i thought adope announced they were shutting down operations
[19:48:33] <ch3mical> Flash, blech
[19:48:37] <ekz> for html5 / rich content
[19:48:45] <ekz> surfdue : lol
[19:48:53] <ekz> the photoshop boys wwould commit suicide
[19:48:54] <surfdue> ekz: ?
[19:49:01] <surfdue> no i mean about flash
[19:49:07] <surfdue> "Adobe shutting the doors on flash ...."
[19:49:07] <ch3mical> surfdue: you mean they are pulling flash from *mobile*
[19:49:10] <ekz> theres more to adobe than what they inherited from macromedia
[19:49:12] <surfdue> oh the ... is mobile :P
[19:49:16] <ekz> surfdue : mobile
[19:49:17] <ekz> yeah
[19:49:22] <surfdue> same thing
[19:49:26] <ekz> but still, adobe has lost our confidence
[19:49:29] <ekz> totally
[19:49:38] <surfdue> im just waiting for microsoft to announce their new browser.. Chromie
[19:49:40] <surfdue> .. lol
[19:49:43] <ekz> hence why I am here today, with my head hanging a few degrees lower. and asking about jquery :-)
[19:49:51] <ch3mical> Flash will go the way of the dinosaurs eventually
[19:49:59] <ekz> ch3mical : exactly
[19:50:04] <surfdue> hey ch3mical watch your tongue, dinosaurs are real.
[19:50:08] <ekz> lol
[19:50:10] <surfdue> ly dead
[19:50:12] <ekz> any reconmednations
[19:50:17] <ekz> on jquery editors?
[19:50:25] <ekz> i'm all on eclipse
[19:50:26] <surfdue> ekz: for wysiwig
[19:50:36] <ekz> but if there are any wysiwyg editors that arent eclipse, bring em on
[19:50:44] <ekz> yeah, but i will survive if there are no wysiwyg
[19:50:49] <surfdue> tbh the last time i needed one i used the first result on google for jquery wysiwig :P
[19:50:50] <ekz> as i'm sure they would be horribly ineffecient
[19:50:56] <surfdue> eclipse?!
[19:51:03] <surfdue> thats like a dev environment
[19:51:05] <ekz> the eclipse ide
[19:51:06] <ekz> yeah.
[19:51:08] <ekz> lol
[19:51:11] <ekz> thats what i code in
[19:51:21] <ekz> with plugins for php, adobe flex, actionscript, html, etc
[19:51:35] <ekz> whats a good jquery one, is the question now
[19:51:40] <surfdue> OH
[19:51:41] <surfdue> coda
[19:51:43] <ekz> (wysiwyg preferred, but not necessary)
[19:51:47] <ch3mical> Eclipse is nice, but for most things I find it to be overkill
[19:51:55] <surfdue> there isnt wysiwyg for coding languages :/
[19:51:58] <ch3mical> I usually use Komodo or Notepad++
[19:52:05] <surfdue> i like coda or textedit
[19:52:09] <surfdue> maybe some nano
[19:52:14] <ch3mical> I hate WYSIWYG
[19:52:14] <surfdue> vi i never got.. :q
[19:52:17] <ekz> surfdue : for interface coding, yeah... adobe EDGE, for example, but it requires vista
[19:52:23] <surfdue> :/
[19:52:24] <ekz> coda, okay will look into it
[19:52:27] <ekz> has code completion
[19:52:30] <ekz> ?
[19:52:36] <surfdue> ya there is  plugins
[19:52:43] <surfdue> it required mac
[19:52:44] <surfdue> :P
[19:52:47] <ch3mical> Vista? You can't run it on Win7?
[19:52:48] <ch3mical> heh
[19:53:09] <surfdue> your sentance looks empty.. are you by change using *win*
[19:53:18] <surfdue> chance*
[19:53:19] <ekz> i run xp
[19:53:21] <ekz> ...
[19:53:26] <ekz> yeah.
[19:53:32] <surfdue> ekz: if I used the os that we must not name, I would also use xp.
[19:53:36] <ekz> adob edge allows you to coreograph animations, and so on
[19:53:50] <ekz> and it spits out your html5 / jquery
[19:54:00] <surfdue> I would like to know what companies still hire flash devs, except game companies :P
[19:54:10] <ekz> ( sorry I should have made it clear that this was more specifically for the interaction bit of jquery, not so much db connectivity )
[19:54:21] <ekz> surfdue : more than you would think
[19:54:25] <ekz> but now, we're all panicking
[19:54:37] <ekz> as our companies are like "wtf? time to find html5 guys"
[19:54:44] <ekz> its sad, adobe flex is so damn powerful
[19:54:48] <surfdue> ch3mical: ever hear of pines notify
[19:54:51] <ekz> what with the powerful debugging and optimization tools
[19:54:53] <ekz> and unit testing
[19:54:56] <ekz> code coverage tools
[19:55:00] <ekz> and socket connections
[19:55:06] <ekz> and rtmp ( real time protocols )
[19:55:10] <ch3mical> surfdue: maybe? I dunno
[19:55:11] <ekz> i suppose html5 will get there
[19:55:13] <ekz> *sig*
[19:55:20] <ekz> *sigh*
[19:55:21] <ekz> brb
[19:55:25] <surfdue> i would be panicing too if the my main income came from a solution provided by a company that has to PAY people to be stockholders.
[19:55:27] <surfdue> literally.. :P
[19:55:34] <ekz> surfdue : lol
[19:55:45] <ch3mical> I wouldn't mind getting paid to hold stock
[19:57:09] <surfdue> technically you do as dividens..
[19:57:17] <surfdue> I make about .24 cents a year with my disney stock
[19:57:35] <ch3mical> Time to retire on that
[19:57:41] <surfdue> its building up quite fast, I think by 1,500,000 ad I will be a thousandaire
[19:58:01] * surfdue places bets on sexy princess
[19:58:04] <surfdue> es*
[19:58:33] <zachera> is it possible to store the word "ajax" into an array and then use it as part of the ajax function call
[19:58:40] <zachera> var a="ajax"; $.a({}); ?
[19:59:47] <mrryanjohnston> zachera: that would be $."ajax" I think
[20:02:06] <Eviltwin> zachera: Yes
[20:02:18] <zachera> Eviltwin: how
[20:02:20] <Eviltwin> var a="ajax"; $[a]({})
[20:02:27] <zachera> noway
[20:03:16] <Eviltwin> foo.bar === foo["bar"]
[20:03:40] <zachera> ah right because $ is technically just an enormous object
[20:03:50] <zachera> full of methods and variables
[20:04:04] <Eviltwin> Well $ is a function but functions are also objects
[20:04:15] <surfdue> morning Eviltwin :P
[20:04:17] <Eviltwin> And they've added a lot of functions to that object
[20:04:23] <Eviltwin> surfdue: It's actually late evening here :P
[20:04:28] <surfdue> same thing.
[20:04:33] <zachera> x = a lot * x
[20:04:34] <zachera> :D
[20:04:56] <surfdue> zachera: habla espanol?
[20:05:25] <zachera> Я говорю на русском ;)
[20:05:30] * surfdue shrugs
[20:05:32] <surfdue> me either...
[20:05:39] <zachera> lol
[20:05:46] <surfdue> I also don't speak giberish, like so posted above.
[20:06:15] <zachera> that's russian you just insulted -_-
[20:06:17] <surfdue> Good day sirs(and maims) this chat is delaying my script output.
[20:06:27] <surfdue> zachera: I was obv. joking
[20:06:36] <surfdue> my irc plugin tells me its russian.
[20:06:54] <surfdue> "Geiberish detected, would you like me to try to translate into English"
[20:07:04] <surfdue> No. I want to decypher it myself. :P
[20:07:34] <zachera> haha
[20:07:36] <zachera> nice. :)
[20:07:39] <surfdue> -.O awkward....
[20:07:42] <rubynfootball> on click of another element, how do I change the selected value of a select dropdown?
[20:07:44] <surfdue> I thought you hated me for a second.
[20:07:47] <zachera> Eviltwin: anyways, the reason i asked was because of this website: w-3.net
[20:07:51] <zachera> check out the source code..
[20:08:03] <zachera> line 8 in particular
[20:08:19] <Eviltwin> Looks minified
[20:08:32] <Eviltwin> Probably wouldn't be too hard to fix some of this with find and replace
[20:09:29] <zachera> refresh ;)
[20:09:32] <surfdue> Eviltwin: you werent here when i got into a twitter fight with my isp
[20:09:37] <surfdue> and they disconnected my internet remotely.
[20:09:38] <surfdue> lol
[20:09:47] <zachera> wtf?
[20:09:50] <zachera> ISPs use twitter?
[20:09:58] <zachera> (lol involuntarily)
[20:10:00] <surfdue> isps power twitter.
[20:10:01] <surfdue> :P
[20:10:37] <Eviltwin> zachera: http://pastebin.com/bm9ivYR1
[20:10:40] <Eviltwin> Good hunting :P
[20:11:11] <zachera> paste on pastie.org
[20:11:14] <zachera> because pastebin.com isn't working for me
[20:11:15] <zachera> o.O
[20:11:39] <Eviltwin> http://pastie.org/3065297
[20:11:52] <zachera> ha
[20:12:04] <zachera> almost thought for a sec there that you actually did the find/replace for every character o_o
[20:12:23] <zachera> not that i've applied unwarranted self-importance on this code, just something i crafted in a great deal of time
[20:12:30] <zachera> but anyhow
[20:12:37] <zachera> the reason i'm here is because i'm curious if it would be possible to replace things like
[20:12:51] <zachera> $.ajax() with .. like $[a], you were saying?
[20:13:02] <zachera> just to make the code even uglier than before :)
[20:13:16] <surfdue> they must have gotten into an argument on twitter with their isp too
[20:13:47] <zachera> wat
[20:14:15] <zachera> rubynfootball: $('.something').val('new_val');
[20:14:20] <zachera> oh wait
[20:14:36] <zachera> $('.something').click(function(){$('.something_else').val('new_val');});
[20:15:42] <surfdue> just because its one line dosnt mean you can post it here.
[20:15:53] <surfdue> Who do you take us for? #asp.net?
[20:16:02] <surfdue> :P
[20:17:12] <zachera> o.-
[20:17:44] <surfdue> zachera: what are you making?
[20:17:50] <zachera> nothing
[20:17:52] <mrryanjohnston> anything with .net on it makes me a little queasy inside
[20:17:58] <surfdue> zachera: and im santa claus.
[20:18:04] <zachera> i'm making a monster of readable code
[20:18:10] <surfdue> mrryanjohnston: i just passed away, this is a ghost message.
[20:18:29] <surfdue> zachera: I also make monsters... of poop
[20:18:36] <mrryanjohnston> surfdue: what did you write that script in
[20:18:57] <surfdue> mrryanjohnston: godSharp
[20:19:07] <surfdue> even God uses microsoft products.. *sigh*
[20:19:18] <zachera> minecraft
[20:19:19] <zachera> microsoft
[20:19:22] <zachera> hard to tell the difference
[20:19:30] <surfdue> I guess thats why his notification center has not worked since human kind was invented.
[20:19:33] <surfdue> :P
[20:19:36] <mrryanjohnston> zachera: one is a game, the other is a very large software company
[20:19:58] <rubynfootball> I'm trying to use this to set the value of a select box back to its default value:  $("select#elem").prop('selectedIndex', 0);  what data should go in the prop portion of the statement?
[20:20:20] <zachera> store the selected value?
[20:20:22] <zachera> reference back to i?
[20:20:23] <zachera> reference back to it?
[20:20:29] <zachera> var default = $('select').val();
[20:20:33] <zachera> ...
[20:20:38] <zachera> $('select').val(default);
[20:20:39] <zachera> ...
[20:21:19] <rubynfootball> zachera:  jquery site says prop is now the prefered way to do this now
[20:21:33] <rubynfootball> as of 1.6
[20:21:49] <zachera> wut
[20:21:55] <zachera> i was saying you should reference back to it
[20:21:56] <zachera> store the default
[20:21:59] <zachera> then use the default var later
[20:22:06] <zachera> isn't that the better way? or is that more costly?
[20:23:36] <surfdue> How reliable is parseTheme.php on themeroller?
[20:23:42] <surfdue> if that goes down should I expect the internet to go down?
[20:24:34] <Eviltwin> rubynfootball: What about the defaultSelected property?
[20:24:56] <surfdue> Eviltwin: good question for you to answer :)
[20:25:12] <Eviltwin> surfdue: A PHP question?
[20:25:28] <surfdue> Eviltwin: no im referring to the one on themeroller on jquery's site
[20:25:39] <surfdue> im asking if its reliable enough to load from on a live site
[20:25:48] <Eviltwin> Um...I don't know
[20:25:51] <Eviltwin> I'm not quiet clear
[20:25:55] <Eviltwin> ThemeRoller where?
[20:26:00] <surfdue> did that work?
[20:26:09] <surfdue> jqueryui.com
[20:26:40] <surfdue> http://bit.ly/sCkW0j
[20:26:58] <Eviltwin> I really have no idea
[20:27:16] <Eviltwin> I wouldn't rely on it though
[20:27:47] <rubynfootball> Eviltwin:  actually $("select#company_storage").prop('selectedIndex', 0); works
[20:28:04] <rubynfootball> didn't know it would, but...
[21:05:18] <surfdue> How do I put a function into a namespace? Foo.bar(boo);  ?? var Foo.bar = function(boo);
[21:15:45] <surfdue> YEP.
[21:16:39] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you need to learn JavaScript
[21:16:44] <surfdue> whats that?
[21:17:06] <surfdue> Eviltwin: since I started using jquery I have erased that part of my mind. If it dosnt exist in jquery.. it dosnt exist.
[21:17:09] <surfdue> ;)

[21:17:19] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[21:17:27] <surfdue> except for dinosaurs.. for some odd reason jquery.js doesn't mention dinosaurs once..
[21:17:51] <surfdue> Eviltwin: I was kidding.
[21:18:07] <surfdue> my brain capacity is at 25% of normality atm thus the strange question
[21:18:49] <surfdue> sometimes I can forget entire programming languages untill I acquire atleast +8 hours of sleep.

[21:21:43] <surfdue> juha_: no.
[21:21:51] <surfdue> oops. tab wrog
[21:21:54] <surfdue> off*
[21:45:51] <bobbobbins> hey, I'm trying to add a class to a <li> and every <li> before it, does anyone know how to do this?
[21:52:54] <MysterOnyx> anyone around at this hour
[21:53:03] <CantUnplug> yip
[21:53:46] <MysterOnyx> this is simple I think
[21:54:13] <MysterOnyx> $(this).jPlayer("setMedia", { mp3: "x.mp3"});
[21:54:16] <MysterOnyx> I have that line
[21:54:44] <MysterOnyx> I want to replace "x.mp3" with a variable. When I do so, it stops working, I'm guessing because of the quotes
[21:54:57] <CantUnplug> dont know anything about jplayer
[21:55:12] <CantUnplug> oh.. nevermind
[21:55:20] <MysterOnyx> right
[21:55:48] <MysterOnyx> can you help me with correctly typing out the variable code. I keep trying and failing to get it to accept it
[21:56:08] <CantUnplug> 1 sec.. sorry, on phone call too..
[21:56:31] <CantUnplug> all of a suddent they neede me to actually be present
[21:56:32] <MysterOnyx> I've tried $x="'"+$file+"'";
[21:56:41] <MysterOnyx> and then having mp3: $x
[21:57:17] <MysterOnyx> it will alert out a 'file.mp3' if I ask it to, but it won't accept it in the line
[21:58:04] <CantUnplug> the whole x.mp3 needs to be a variable?
[21:58:10] <CantUnplug> or just the x part
[21:58:42] <CantUnplug> var songToPlay = 'xyz.mp3'
[21:58:57] <CantUnplug> $(this).jPlayer("setMedia", { mp3: songtoplay});
[21:59:03] <CantUnplug> er.. camel case
[21:59:48] <CantUnplug> where is the 'file' variable coming from?  Dom, ajax, etc?
[22:00:22] <MysterOnyx> I made it up
[22:00:28] <MysterOnyx> it's jscript
[22:00:47] <MysterOnyx> I have an array that is filled with mp3 names
[22:01:08] <MysterOnyx> when I alert array[1], I get 'x.mp3'
[22:01:27] <MysterOnyx> but when I fill the line with mp3: array[1], it doesn't accept it
[22:02:49] <CantUnplug> try array[1].toString()
[22:03:51] <MysterOnyx> nope.. arg
[22:03:57] <MysterOnyx> this is insanity
[22:04:02] <CantUnplug> do this..
[22:04:18] <CantUnplug> var songToPlay = array[1];
[22:04:24] <CantUnplug> $(this).jPlayer("setMedia", { mp3: songToPlay});
[22:04:38] <CantUnplug> it shouldnt matter, but ive had that happen before
[22:05:03] <CantUnplug> can you stick it on jsfiddle
[22:05:49] <MysterOnyx> sure one sec
[22:07:20] <MysterOnyx> http://jsfiddle.net/LYDwt/
[22:07:41] <MysterOnyx> if that doesn't work I'm sorry, the code is mostly php and is all over the place
[22:07:53] <CantUnplug> code is php?
[22:08:03] <MysterOnyx> not the part I put into jsfiddle
[22:08:36] <MysterOnyx> here's the whole page source: view-source:http://mysteronyx.com/new_audio/testjp2.php
[22:08:37] <CantUnplug> i think the '$' might be messing you up.. im not sure, but i beleive its tryign to run them all as jquery objects
[22:08:44] <CantUnplug> since $ is jquery object
[22:08:52] <MysterOnyx> yeah
[22:08:59] <MysterOnyx> that's probably it
[22:09:08] <MysterOnyx> so you're thinking I can't put variables inside that jquery object
[22:09:10] <CantUnplug> your $x="4".... is reading out as jQueryx="4"
[22:09:19] <CantUnplug> yes, but you dont need '$'
[22:09:23] <CantUnplug> its javascript.. not php
[22:09:36] <MysterOnyx> hmm
[22:09:39] <CantUnplug> $foo = bar < PHP....  var foo = 'bar' < JS
[22:10:23] <CantUnplug> is this supposed to be a Javascript array or a php array?  "$gallery[$x]"
[22:10:35] <CantUnplug> .. ie are you missing <?php echo $gallery[$x]; ?>
[22:10:57] <MysterOnyx> no it already echos it
[22:11:23] <CantUnplug> .. no.. what i mean, is $gallery[$x] Javascript code?  '$gallery' is a javascript array?
[22:11:33] <MysterOnyx> yea it's jscript
[22:11:37] <CantUnplug> or are you trying to output the php variabel "$gallery[$x]"
[22:11:38] <CantUnplug> ok
[22:11:42] <MysterOnyx> it's doing this because there are no quotes there, so I'm going to try and put quotes in via php
[22:11:47] <CantUnplug> pl
[22:11:48] <CantUnplug> ok
[22:11:58] <CantUnplug> ditch the '$' with the exception of the $()
[22:12:07] <MysterOnyx> ok
[22:12:14] <CantUnplug> .. im not positive.. but its confusing to read
[22:12:16] <MysterOnyx> you mean in general for all variables
[22:12:18] <CantUnplug> and you dont need it
[22:12:22] <CantUnplug> yeah..
[22:12:24] <MysterOnyx> ok
[22:12:28] <CantUnplug> dont make Javascript into PHP
[22:13:28] <MysterOnyx> but I must
[22:15:00] <CantUnplug> nevermind... i didnt explain right
[22:15:11] <MysterOnyx> I was joking
[22:16:03] <CantUnplug> i beleive its technically ok.. i just hate mixing styles..  confuses the hell out of me.. especially when workign in php, AS3, JS etc.. to try and switch is bad enough.. but crossign styles makes it harder
[22:16:29] <CantUnplug> and now coffeescript ruby esq.. ugh
[22:16:57] <MysterOnyx> yea
[22:17:22] <CantUnplug> ive also seen this work..  you have "$("#jquery_jplayer_"+$x).jPlayer("
[22:17:35] <MysterOnyx> ok, so if you look a little lower in the code, I was able to get "#jp_container"+x
[22:17:39] <MysterOnyx> hah exactly
[22:17:58] <CantUnplug> make into var toCheck = "#jquery_jplayer_"+x;
[22:18:05] <CantUnplug> $(toCheck).jPlayer(
[22:18:24] <MysterOnyx> you'd think I could just do "'"+array+"'"
[22:18:35] <CantUnplug> its finicky
[22:19:14] <CantUnplug> break it out all the way, get it workign.. then refactor it tighter
[22:19:31] <CantUnplug> go test in 9 browsers/versions and then see fi it stilll works
[22:19:45] <MysterOnyx> lol
[22:20:14] <CantUnplug> i keep a nice bottle of Zaya and a shot glass on my desk just for JS days
[22:21:11] <MysterOnyx> christ... so "x.mp"+3 works
[22:22:02] <MysterOnyx> but ""+array[x] doesn't
[22:25:54] <surfdue> why cant I do var Foo = $.function ?
[22:26:06] <surfdue> $.function is already a jquery function in this case.
[22:27:47] <abjorn> (づ￣ ³￣)づ
[22:28:03] <surfdue> whats that
[22:28:16] <surfdue> looks like the blob thing from star wars
[22:28:30] <surfdue> rymes with sunglass hut..
[22:28:33] <surfdue> jabba hut :P
[22:38:13] <MysterOnyx> CantUnplug you there?
[23:03:56] <E289> hi. i have a <ul> that contains <li> items. i want a search box on top so that i can type there a string and it only lists down <li> that contains the *text*. when the search box is left blank, it lists all items. how can i do this? :)
[23:04:02] <surfdue> anyone firmiliar with routesjs
[23:04:30] <LordThumper> Regarding javascript variable scope.
[23:04:46] <LordThumper> If i have two .each functions, one inside the other
[23:04:59] <LordThumper> How do i differentiate between the two [index] parameters?
[23:05:14] <wookiehangover> ?each
[23:05:14] <LordThumper> i will create an example on jsfiddle
[23:05:15] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[23:05:31] <wookiehangover> each( function(index, Element){ ... } )
[23:05:56] <LordThumper> each( function(index) { each ( function(index) { } ) } )
[23:06:09] <LordThumper> How do i differentiate outer index from inner?
[23:06:09] <E289> ok that answers my question too
[23:06:10] <E289> thanks
[23:08:46] <surfdue> if I am inside of document on .ready would it be proper to do var foo = function() {}
[23:08:49] <surfdue> to create a function ?
[23:12:47] <surfdue> I dont get how to make this instance mentioned here http://routesjs.com/
[23:18:28] <danieliser> how can i do a search and replace on something? its for an autocomplete form, i want to bold the queried letters in the results
[23:19:00] <danieliser> need to foreach my results and add html <b> tags around the queried letters
[23:19:39] <danieliser> but abc needs to match Abc
[23:25:56] <Eviltwin> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/JUNjc/
[23:26:02] <LordThumper> $("#id").each(function () { if // (logic here) { $(this).wrap(<b></b>)}
[23:27:05] <danieliser> ty both.. twin that looks awesome
[23:28:15] <surfdue> Eviltwin: this is driving me nuts.. How can I make a object/method using singletons http://routesjs.com/
[23:28:39] <surfdue> i just need a start then i can take it from there, using their example MyClass, I cant figure out where to add the functions to the instance()
[23:29:21] <Eviltwin> Are you asking how to use routejs?
[23:29:40] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: I like how you avoid jQuery inside the function
[23:29:42] <LordThumper> looks very neat
[23:29:56] <surfdue> Eviltwin: no im asking how to make the following variable page.instance().method
[23:29:59] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: I don't think jQuery would add anything there
[23:30:10] <Eviltwin> surfdue: They show you right there
[23:30:11] <LordThumper> Oh ok, thought it was good practise
[23:30:14] <Eviltwin> surfdue: http://routesjs.com/#singletons
[23:30:28] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: It's good practice to not use libraries when they don't really add anything
[23:30:33] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i cant figure it out.. I am using that.. I put a console.log inside before the return.. How do I add a method to the instance?
[23:30:34] <Eviltwin> And in this case it didn't really add anything
[23:30:45] <LordThumper> Yeah exactly
[23:31:01] <Eviltwin> surfdue: MyClass.prototype.method = function(arg1,arg2,...) { ... }
[23:31:20] <Eviltwin> Or inside the MyClass = function(){...}
[23:31:30] <Eviltwin> You put this.method = function(arg1,arg2,...) { ...}
[23:31:30] <surfdue> Eviltwin: do I need all this instance _instance stuff
[23:31:34] <surfdue> what is _instance?
[23:31:38] <Eviltwin> That's what makes it a singleton
[23:31:43] <Eviltwin> There's on instance of the class
[23:31:54] <Eviltwin> surfdue: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern
[23:32:20] <surfdue> i just dont get it, it pisses me off.. its like i dont understand ive never not understood programming
[23:32:27] <LordThumper> Ok the JSON created by the Chrome inbuit JSON library does not comply to the standard
[23:32:29] <surfdue> -.-
[23:32:32] <LordThumper> Need to find an external library....
[23:32:51] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Think of it as a global instance of a class
[23:33:00] <Eviltwin> That you use to organize stuff
[23:33:07] <Eviltwin> Like pass information from one class to another
[23:33:35] <Eviltwin> There are other ways to do it in JavaScript but this is designed to make it a lot like the singleton pattern in Ruby
[23:33:58] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i know this is wrong can u help me get on track? http://pastebin.com/2025fdxp
[23:34:13] <surfdue> Eviltwin: its killing me.. i dont get ruby lol
[23:34:39] <Eviltwin> surfdue: I've already just explained how to add methods
[23:34:45] <Eviltwin> I'm not going to explain it again
[23:34:48] <Eviltwin> Scroll up if needed
[23:34:55] <LordThumper> Pastebin is down for me
[23:35:33] <surfdue> Eviltwin: please.. dude i dont understand.. I dont know WHERE to put it
[23:35:53] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Your lines 15 and 19 are incorrect for adding new methods
[23:36:09] <surfdue> Eviltwin: so i put this.method inside of instance function?
[23:36:12] <Eviltwin> If you scroll up, I showed you the keyword you're missing
[23:36:33] <surfdue> Eviltwin: the prototype shit? i thought u said i could use this or something too
[23:36:38] <surfdue> i dont like the looks of that prototype :P
[23:36:57] <Eviltwin> surfdue: I told you where to put them with "this"
[23:37:01] <Eviltwin> You're not reading
[23:37:06] <Eviltwin> You need to read
[23:37:07] <surfdue> its 2:30am
[23:37:08] <surfdue> lol
[23:37:16] <Eviltwin> And?
[23:37:19] <Eviltwin> You're point?
[23:37:30] <surfdue> let me try to go back and read it
[23:37:32] <surfdue> 1 sec.
[23:38:42] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i got it.
[23:39:26] <surfdue> Eviltwin: is there a reason why myclass.instance function dosnt just do return new MyClass() ?
[23:39:39] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:39:44] <Eviltwin> Because it's a singleton :P
[23:39:57] <surfdue> but will that work?
[23:40:14] <surfdue> i just hate all these extra lines if they are not needed :)
[23:40:25] <Eviltwin> It will return the same instance every time
[23:40:32] <Eviltwin> But it will only instantiate it if you use it at least one
[23:40:40] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern
[23:40:45] <surfdue> ah
[23:40:45] <Eviltwin> Read the first sentence
[23:40:47] <Eviltwin> All the way to the period
[23:41:04] <surfdue> -.- whoever invented this made the wheel square.
[23:41:14] <surfdue> anyways thx Eviltwin
[23:41:17] <surfdue> again..
[23:41:34] <Eviltwin> No problem
[23:41:35] <Eviltwin> Well
[23:41:38] <Eviltwin> Small problem
[23:41:49] <Eviltwin> Being lazy while someone's volunteering their time
[23:41:56] <Eviltwin> Not a great way to get them to continue to volunteer
[23:42:09] <Eviltwin> You gotta put in the effort otherwise I'm not going to
[23:43:30] <surfdue> Eviltwin: yep. i just took an energy shot
[23:44:53] <surfdue> I guess this dosn't essentially make a difference, but I would like to keep my namespace the same throughout my site. I changed MyClass to Site.Page, however I realize that it does not work.. Probably because of the way routes loads the object im guessing?
[23:45:23] <Eviltwin> Probably but I don't know
[23:45:29] <Eviltwin> You can try something like Site/Page#method
[23:46:03] <surfdue> let me dig into the routes.js
[23:47:33] <Eviltwin> I'm going to sleep. Good luck to you
[23:48:43] <surfdue> night
