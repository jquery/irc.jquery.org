[00:02:15] <coldhead> hahahahah this plugin is perfect for me
[00:02:23] <coldhead> i write all my code on one line
[00:02:33] <coldhead> so it deals with all my bugs IN ONE ITERATION
[00:05:24] <rchavik> hello, is there a way to construct the markup so that $.data('tweet_id') is 'string' because now i'm getting the last digit changed to '0' http://jsfiddle.net/RGsPg/2/
[00:07:23] <Eviltwin> Rabi: http://jsfiddle.net/RGsPg/3/
[00:07:25] <Eviltwin> Err

[00:08:29] <rchavik> *shame*
[00:12:58] <Rovanion> When is it appropriate to use $.on() ?
[00:13:21] <systemfault> When you need to bind to events?
[00:13:34] <systemfault> Not sure I get the question..
[00:13:50] <Rovanion> I mean, in comparison to .bind() and .live()
[00:14:02] <systemfault> .bind and .live are dead.
[00:14:03] <Rovanion> And .delegate()
[00:14:10] <systemfault> .delegate is also dead.
[00:14:25] <systemfault> .on is the new cool unified, do it all function for events.
[00:14:56] <coldhead> HOPE FOR WARM BODIES
[00:15:08] <systemfault> coldhead: Creepy.
[00:15:44] <Rovanion> systemfault: But if I want to bind actions to DOM that's loaded after document.ready trough AJAX. Do I do .on() on a parent div like with .delegate()?
[00:16:06] <systemfault> Rovanion: Pretty much
[00:16:41] <systemfault> $('parentelementselector').on('click', 'targetselector', function() {});
[00:17:02] <systemfault> That's for event delegation (.live/.delegate)
[00:17:20] <systemfault> For normal bindingâ€¦ $('selector').on('click', function(){});
[00:17:22] <Rovanion> So; If <div id="AjaxDiv" /> is loaded after document.ready. I cannot select it with $('#AjaxDiv').on()
[00:17:27] <NodeX> systemfault has no clue what he is talking about, you really should not listen to him
[00:17:54] <systemfault> Rovanion: You would do $(document).on('click', '#AjaxDiv', function() {]);
[00:18:01] <NodeX> $('body').on('click','#AjaxDiv',function(){...});
[00:18:51] <Rovanion> Both your explanations seem to match, so I'll just check the docs first anyways :P
[00:19:29] <NodeX> the difference is I know what I am doing, whereas systemfault is a bad kid who guesses
[00:19:49] <mink> Maybe now any one can tell me what is the best way to console.log(this.function) in plugin looks like this -> http://jsfiddle.net/4Ymxp/  ^^
[00:20:47] <NodeX> where are you trying to log it?
[00:21:18] <mink> NodeX, toggle: function(options){            console.log(options);        }
[00:21:34] <NodeX> and what are you trying to log?
[00:21:48] <NodeX> I dont see this.function in your code
[00:21:50] <mink> this.options. Sorry, it wrong paste
[00:22:01] <mink> NodeX, this.options = $.extend( {}, defaults, options) ;
[00:22:36] <mink> And I can console.log(this.options) in init function. But when I try do it in other function it's impossible
[00:22:56] <NodeX> you need to pass the object to it
[00:23:25] <NodeX> var that=this; this.init(that); ..... init : function(foo) { ... foo is the previous object
[00:25:02] <mink> NodeX, I can console.log(this.options) in init function. But if I want console.log(this.options) in toggle function, it's impossible.
[00:25:32] <Cork> mink: your calling toggle through prototype
[00:25:41] <Cork> that will lose the connection to the object
[00:25:51] <Cork> Plugin.prototype.toggle(options); <--
[00:25:55] <NodeX> ^^
[00:26:24] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/4Ymxp/1/
[00:28:40] <mink> NodeX, Cork thanks a lot (:
[00:28:51] <NodeX> :D
[00:47:35] <newbiee> hello need help in a bit complex situation
[00:48:21] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[00:48:34] <newbiee> i will need to find a div with style set to "" that is display is block an then get its parent div and after that get the next div of the parent div and they both have the same class
[00:48:51] <systemfault> Wow :(
[00:48:51] <newbiee> this is as much specific as i could get
[00:49:10] <blackspotwiggins> use an id?
[00:49:14] <newbiee> searching tutorials point me to .find and .next
[00:50:10] <newbiee> cannot it be done with clas..like the requirement says that once a text of input box of the div is saved then focus to the next div
[00:50:43] <coldhead> you're entering a world of pain, son
[00:50:48] <coldhead> a world of pain
[00:51:12] <Dr-Bombay> walking the tree like that is not the best idea, it's very brittle if your HTML changes
[00:51:13] <blackspotwiggins> anyway, selecting anything by its style is something i would not do
[00:51:13] <newbiee> yeah i know even by using Id i will need a way to know the next id of the focused div or selected div
[00:51:23] <Dr-Bombay> just so you know, there are alternatives
[00:52:06] <blackspotwiggins> document.activeElement might be useful
[00:52:23] <coldhead> i don't think he's ready for that kind of power, blackspotwiggins
[00:52:41] <coldhead> fooooools russssh innnnn
[00:52:48] <systemfault> He needs more levels?
[00:52:50] <newbiee> ihmm so what woul ocument.activeElement give me
[00:53:31] <blackspotwiggins> newbiee, http://i.qkme.me/353uak.jpg
[00:54:31] <newbiee> the link does not open
[00:55:22] <blackspotwiggins> the general idea would be - use google
[00:55:53] <newbiee> i did
[00:57:36] <newbiee> i did $(element),click() and then $(this) and when alert that value got [object][object] how can i know what are those
[00:58:27] <coldhead> don't use alert
[00:58:33] <coldhead> use console.log()
[00:58:36] <coldhead> ?alert
[00:58:36] <bot-t> Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[01:00:48] <newbiee> still running around in circles :(
[01:03:30] <newbiee> now what i am trying to do is get the dom element of the button i clicked and then get to its parent container of div
[01:04:43] <newbiee> the structure is <div><div><div></div><div></div><div><input></div><div></div></div> the first div is the parent container and the input is the one i clicked
[01:04:49] <newbiee> yup a world of pain
[01:05:51] <systemfault> That's what happens when you work with markup without any context.
[01:05:59] <xec> newbiee: i just got a headache
[01:06:06] <phrearch__> hello
[01:06:09] <xec> newbiee: but i think you're missing a </div> there :P
[01:06:09] <newbiee> i am having that from the word go
[01:06:24] <phrearch__> is there a way to determin whether the text of a block element is overflowing or not?
[01:06:26] <xec> newbiee: have you heard of the term "divitis" before?
[01:06:31] <newbiee> yup i forgot to close one div
[01:07:02] <systemfault> xec: It's probably markup generated by some shitty PHP framework :P
[01:08:01] <newbiee> its actually a markup generated to create a sortable listing with each list element editable
[01:08:42] <newbiee> can i number all the parent div starting from one in the id and then if a particular list is edited then get the id of that list
[01:08:50] <newbiee> even then i would have to find out the parent div or the parent li
[01:09:52] <systemfault> newbiee: If you don't have classes.. your markup is shit.
[01:09:55] <xec> newbiee: why don't you show us what you got so far, maybe easier to get an idea of what you're trying to do
[01:10:07] <systemfault> (I'm not saying it's your fault of anything...)
[01:10:59] <newbiee> i can't upload the system yet
[01:11:03] <newbiee> its in local and in development
[01:12:14] <newbiee> i can send a screenshot or something if possibile
[01:12:21] <newbiee> of the currenet system and how it looks like
[01:12:23] <xec> newbiee: we don't need to see the whole system, just the small part you're having issues with
[01:12:31] <xec> a screenshot helps too
[01:12:37] <newbiee> where can i put it?
[01:12:47] <xec> imgur?
[01:13:32] <newbiee> cannot find the link
[01:13:38] <xec> imgur.com ?
[01:14:44] <newbiee> the link does not open
[01:15:08] <newbiee> i m having issues with my internet just a minute
[01:15:41] <Kingsy> guys, I am having really weird  behaviour to click events after ajax calls.. is this normal?
[01:15:51] <xec> brb
[01:16:19] <Kingsy> for example.. a jQuery(".block-title").click(function() { }); is getting called twice on one click after an ajax load
[01:17:06] <systemfault> Kingsy: Could you show us your code or something?
[01:18:34] <Kingsy> hmm its a little "extensive" to create a fiddle
[01:18:43] <Kingsy> just trying some stuff out now
[01:20:55] <newbiee> http://i.imgur.com/igIlF.png
[01:20:59] <newbiee> this is the link for the scrrenshot
[01:21:30] <newbiee> i need the next element of the one being edited that is sub sub tasks to be editable
[01:21:56] <newbiee> br right back after lunch
[01:21:58] <Kingsy> systemfault: hmm weird, the problem is fixed if you re-load the section of the html that has the click event on it with the ajax result. if you don't the event is all messed up
[01:23:19] <systemfault> Ah :/
[01:31:19] <xec> newbiee: have a look at methods like .closest() or .parent() and .next() -- should be able to do what you describe
[01:39:45] <Julien_`> Hello
[01:40:18] <Julien_`> I  wonder if a variable is defined as local context inside a $(document).ready() ...
[01:40:58] <systemfault> If you declare it with var (as you should do) then yes
[01:41:50] <Julien_`> ok
[01:42:01] <Julien_`> thanks :)
[01:46:52] <Lost123> i am using jquery ui for a dialogue and it give undefined instead of ok in a prompt
[01:47:00] <Lost123> how can that be corrected
[01:48:13] <Lost123> jquery-ui.dialogue version is 1.8.16
[01:48:14] <Julien_`> Is there a better way to do this :
[01:48:14] <Julien_`> var panel =  $( $('.category-filter-container').get(0) );
[01:48:16] <Julien_`> ?
[01:48:39] <Julien_`> because 'get(0)' don't return a jquery object...
[01:48:59] <systemfault> .eq(0) IIRC
[01:49:20] <arkascha> I am confused about this not working: $('#jqibox fieldset #payload').val('sometext').select().click(function(){this.select();});
[01:49:47] <arkascha> I would expect 'sometext' to appear in the input field with id payload, which it does.
[01:50:08] <arkascha> I would expect all clicks in that input field to select the text contained, whoch works.
[01:50:22] <systemfault> arkascha: My guess is that you want $(this).select() instead of this.select() inside the function
[01:50:24] <arkascha> But I would also expect that the text would be already selected without clicking it.
[01:50:39] <systemfault> Ah.. then I don't know.
[01:50:42] <arkascha> This does NOT work.
[01:50:58] <arkascha> systemfault: the click handler works fine.
[01:51:36] <arkascha> systemfault: it does _not_ work using $this...
[01:53:08] <sasha_> hey guys
[01:53:15] <sasha_> if i have a question about jquery ui draggable/droppable
[01:53:20] <sasha_> is this the place to ask it
[01:54:46] <sasha_> Basically, I've got a draggable object and multiple droppable boxes
[01:54:56] <sasha_> And some of the boxes overlap
[01:55:14] <sasha_> but I only want the draggable to be dropped on 1 box at any time
[01:55:39] <sasha_> At the moment, if the droppables overlap, if the draggable is dropped on 1 box, all boxes touching that box count as having the object dropped on _them_ as well
[01:58:24] <arkascha> What am I missing: http://jsfiddle.net/4CK7Y/1/ ? Why isn't the content of the textarea not selected upon load ?
[01:59:00] <systemfault> arkascha: It is :( On chrome
[01:59:05] <sasha_> is on chrome
[01:59:13] <arkascha> also when NOT clicking ?
[01:59:28] <arkascha> I mean it has to be selected WITHOUT clicking.
[01:59:28] <systemfault> arkascha: it's selected on load without clicking
[01:59:33] <arkascha> hm
[01:59:35] <systemfault> Also fine on Safari
[01:59:48] * arkascha is very confused.
[02:00:00] <arkascha> thanks !
[02:01:19] <arkascha> too in opera, konqueror and rekonq. Stupid fox !
[02:01:49] <systemfault> But but but!!1!!!111 fox has a 3d dom inspector!
[02:02:44] <arkascha> strange, the content IS highlighted in Firefox upon a complet reload.
[02:06:09] <kreol[Ukr]> hi all. i have some problem: i work with cmf drupal. and there is jquery 1.5.2. but i need for example last version without removing first. So i need two jquery on one page. How can i do this? (i think i have to use jQuery.noConflict()) but i'm not sure.
[02:10:38] <duffyblackpeace> you can put it like this        (function ($) {  // all your jquery stuff goes here       })(jQuery);
[02:10:44] <duffyblackpeace> just wrapping it in a closure
[02:11:17] <duffyblackpeace> i hope that helps
[02:13:03] <raj> shoky, holla
[02:14:25] <Lost123> i am using jquery ui for a dialogue and it give undefined instead of ok in a prompt
[02:14:31] <Lost123> jquery-ui.dialogue version is 1.8.16
[02:14:49] <kreol[Ukr]> <duffyblackpeace> thanks. i'll try it
[02:17:01] <shal3r> When i set FORM action to URL with & character and then do form.submit(), user gets redirected to URI with &amp; (& get's encoded). How to avoid this?
[02:18:07] <newbiee> how to get the active dom element
[02:18:21] <newbiee> and then its parent container
[02:18:59] <blackspotwiggins> newbiee, like i told you a long time ago, document.activeElement
[02:19:06] <shoky> hy raj
[02:19:22] <blackspotwiggins> and if you bothered to google the exact phrase you typed there, you would see it as the first result
[02:19:41] <newbiee> i did but is it jquery equivalent
[02:19:49] <raj> niceeeee
[02:20:03] <raj> after 4 days break, I've gotta followup question, lol
[02:20:07] <blackspotwiggins> .. what?
[02:20:32] <mink> Maybe anyone how i can get all child from first line? (:
[02:21:29] <blackspotwiggins> mink, all children of what?
[02:22:21] <raj> shoky, calling $timer.timer('reset') doesn't work
[02:22:32] <raj> am I supposed to call that on the $('.card')?
[02:23:52] <shoky> hm can you link me to the fiddle
[02:24:27] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/t4MRN/5/
[02:24:36] <Lost123> shoky:  can u help....i am using jquery ui for a dialogue and it give undefined instead of ok in a prompt
[02:24:40] <Lost123> jquery-ui.dialogue version is 1.8.16
[02:24:41] <raj> at least I think that's the latest
[02:24:49] <shoky> no that's an old one, no?
[02:25:02] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/wx7cWSHKz63sYd3Rw9qJRp
[02:25:04] <raj> that's the latest
[02:25:52] <mink> blackspotwiggins, i want get only 'li' column, not foo http://jsfiddle.net/ayPTL/
[02:26:58] <blackspotwiggins> mink, $("li:not(:has(foo))"), but not sure if that works
[02:27:33] <teleyinex> Hi everyone
[02:27:38] <mink> blackspotwiggins, I don't have defined structure of column. I want get only first column.
[02:27:39] <mink> But thanks :)\
[02:27:47] <blackspotwiggins> first column?
[02:27:56] <blackspotwiggins> how do you define the first column?
[02:28:21] <teleyinex> I'm trying to add to the DOM a string when the async call has been completed
[02:28:43] <teleyinex> I'm using the d3.js framework for visualizing some data, and I'm having some issues updating some labels
[02:29:04] <teleyinex> the labels are IDs and I want to replace them via ajax calls
[02:29:46] <blackspotwiggins> teleyinex, doesnt d3 use canvas?
[02:29:48] <teleyinex> I'm using this approach: var r = $.ajax().pipe(function(data){return data.name})
[02:30:11] <teleyinex> blackspotwiggins, I'm using SVG via d3
[02:30:27] <shoky> raj
[02:30:32] <raj> yessir
[02:30:44] <shoky> i think you need to change  in reset():  this.start = Date.now();   ->     this.when = Date.now();
[02:30:49] <teleyinex> then I try return r and I get the object not the string :-)
[02:30:56] <teleyinex> any idea about how I can solve this issue?
[02:31:28] <raj> k
[02:32:56] <shoky> this was the latest one i made: http://jsfiddle.net/aSfEB/11/
[02:33:40] <blackspotwiggins> teleyinex, set the stuff from the callback
[02:33:47] <blackspotwiggins> r is always going to be an object
[02:33:55] <systemfault> shoky: What's that?
[02:34:13] <systemfault> shoky: A more precise timer using requestAnimFrame?
[02:34:28] <teleyinex> blackspotwiggins, how?  :-) I mean, do I have to define the string as a callback?
[02:35:00] <shoky> systemfault: yea raj wanted it a while ago, me & EvilTwin kept improving/tweaking it
[02:35:47] <shoky> to raj's whims!
[02:36:07] <raj> shoky, works beautifully Mr.!
[02:36:11] <shoky> ;]
[02:36:50] <granden> Saw something about a jquery conference this weekend. what is it, some sort of training conference or what? To late to buy ticket for this year but got me intrested in perhaps getting next year.
[02:37:02] <blackspotwiggins> teleyinex, $.ajax().success(function() { // do something with data });
[02:37:42] <raj> shoky, what OS are you on?
[02:37:56] <shoky> raj win7, why? i got some others on VM
[02:38:01] <raj> oh ok
[02:38:05] <raj> just wondering
[02:38:18] <raj> I've been fooling around with Arch
[02:38:25] <raj> which is why I've had no internet for 4 days
[02:39:06] <shoky> hm. first time i hear of it
[02:39:43] <shoky> debian's my linux poison
[02:40:17] <systemfault> shoky: Will debian ever have kernel 2.6? ;)
[02:40:27] <blackspotwiggins> .. they dont?
[02:40:55] <systemfault> blackspotwiggins: I'm jokingâ€¦ it's just that debian stable usually has old versions of softwares..
[02:41:09] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[02:41:13] <blackspotwiggins> they at 2.6.32 it seems
[02:41:52] <blackspotwiggins> unstable @ 2.6.38
[02:42:09] <systemfault> I'm at 3.4 on my fedora 17 workstation :P
[02:42:27] <blackspotwiggins> 3.2 here
[02:43:10] <blackspotwiggins> fedora seems really nice.. until selinux rapes everything you love
[02:43:28] <shoky> hmm
[02:43:36] <blackspotwiggins> i couldnt even get my dev environment up
[02:43:55] <blackspotwiggins> and selinux errors are more cryptic than gcc compile errors
[02:44:41] <systemfault> blackspotwiggins: I always end up disabling it.
[02:47:54] <systemfault> Try this: http://www.buildwithchrome.com/static/map (on chrome)
[02:52:34] <shoky> so, 3.0 released just a year ago, just for 20th linux anniversary
[02:52:47] <shoky> i am happy with my 2.6 ;)
[02:53:16] <shoky> i'm also not a heavy linuxer
[02:53:58] <systemfault> I only use linux when I cannot get OSX..
[03:00:44] <shoky> hm actually i did hear about arch already. donno where my mind was
[03:01:32] <Xotix> can  somehow print a string an see the \n etc?
[03:02:04] <NodeX> console.log("String\nline break")
[03:02:25] <Xotix> i mena liek getting the string from a texarea or whatever and output for debuging
[03:02:52] <NodeX> ^^ console.log or add it to a <pre> / <textarea> - thyey preserve line breaks
[03:03:14] <shoky> ?eval "hi\nbye".replace('\n','\\n')
[03:03:16] <bot-t> shoky: "hi\nbye"
[03:03:18] <Xotix> console log won't show me \n
[03:03:21] <shoky> there you go
[03:03:27] <NodeX> mine does
[03:04:01] <NodeX> >>> console.log("String\nHey");
[03:04:01] <NodeX> String Hey
[03:04:06] <NodeX> plus a line break of course
[03:04:11] <Xotix> shoky  thanks not exactly what i meant but should be okay probably.
[03:04:34] <Xotix> Nodex i want to see it, not have the break but see "\n" :) But anyway thanks
[03:05:23] <NodeX> str.replace("\n","\\n");..

[03:30:02] <newbiee> it is something like that
[03:31:20] <shoky> well that works fine
[03:31:23] <thinced> newbiee: $("#firstol").append("<li>testing</li>"); ?

[03:35:13] <peitolm> is it possible to set an absolute minimum value for a jquery slider? I can set min, and value, but then the slider seems to allow me to go below min
[03:37:11] <newbiee> i want to detect a and A press event but both have same key code
[03:37:13] <newbiee> so what to do
[03:38:03] <shoky> peitolm: what do you mean, it goes below min?
[03:38:11] <GreekFreak> hi all.
[03:38:55] <Xotix> has anyone an idea why I'm losing my linebreaks? http://jsfiddle.net/eJNKy/ I'm putting the pasted stuff into a hidden div  and get it via text();
[03:39:02] <peitolm> well, i want  slider from say 0 to 100, with a starting value of 50, but I want the minimum selectable to be 10
[03:39:09] <peitolm> if that makes sense
[03:39:23] <GreekFreak> In this gist one can see what I have as JS, and I wanted to know if it's correct. Also I'd like to know if there's it's allowed to chain the button().click(). I ask cause I'm coding in CoffeeScript, and it's not easy to try things out. https://gist.github.com/2994938
[03:39:51] <shoky> newbiee: if you use keypress event you'll get different keycodes  (event.which)
[03:41:03] <newbiee> i am getting the same keycode for both small and capital a
[03:41:13] <rohanrhu> hi
[03:41:14] <rohanrhu> i need help
[03:41:46] <peitolm> shoky: i guess i could set something like absmin, and plug some stuff into 'slide' to check the value,
[03:42:05] <shoky> peitolm ah
[03:42:52] <rohanrhu> im handling form submits with .ajaxForm(), form submit and response writing a div and response html existing same form
[03:43:13] <rohanrhu> but response html's form dont handle from .ajaxForm()
[03:43:26] <rohanrhu> i writed a recursive function but it dont works

[03:44:07] <rohanrhu> ajaxform_yakala is recursive
[03:44:50] <Whirl3d> Good mornin all. I am still struggling with when to use "new" ....I am setting up a basic object that will act as a "controller" for various kinds of content. It will have basic methods like show/hide/load.init/configure. and then I wan to generate different implementations of this item based on the content type...
[03:44:50] <shoky> peitolm: you can return false from 'slide' event yea
[03:45:05] <shoky> peitolm: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/12/
[03:45:17] <rohanrhu> where am i doing wrong?
[03:45:49] <rohanrhu> shoky: can you help me
[03:45:58] <shoky> rohanrhu: i donno ajaxForm sry
[03:46:05] <shoky> mornin whirly
[03:46:08] <peitolm> shoky: thanks muchly
[03:46:30] <Whirl3d> mornin' shoky! I see you are up to lots o good this am already...
[03:46:55] <shoky> ;p
[03:47:07] <rohanrhu> shoky: if you see, you may solve
[03:47:16] <shoky> Whirl3d mm you use 'new' when you have a constructor function and want a new instance ;p
[03:47:25] <GreekFreak> I have a button that I want to have it permanently with the "hover state" colours. What class do I need to give it?
[03:48:00] <Whirl3d> See I keep running into this same pattern...
[03:48:06] <shoky> rohanrhu also i don't know turkish :\
[03:48:18] <Whirl3d> I need to show some content/hide content. load/init/config content
[03:48:25] <rohanrhu> shoky: thank you
[03:48:28] <Whirl3d> and sometimes that content has content....
[03:49:28] <Whirl3d> So for example, I have sections on my site. Each section has pages and each page has topics
[03:49:56] <newbiee> how can i check if i am typing inside input box
[03:50:26] <rohanrhu> i solved :)
[03:50:29] <newbiee> i don't want the keydown event to occur when i press a inside input box but want it to hapen if i press it when not typing
[03:50:59] <Whirl3d> newbiee, check to see if the input box has focus by $("input").is(":focus");
[03:51:39] <newbiee> can i use the id of the input in above
[03:52:10] <Whirl3d> $(document).keypress(function (e) {if $("input:focus").length) { do nothing} else { do something});
[03:53:12] <Whirl3d> if ("#inputid").is(":focus")) {do nothing} else {do something}
[03:53:28] <Whirl3d> sorry, $("#input")....
[03:53:44] <newbiee> got it
[03:53:55] <newbiee> but i m still stuck in differentiating between a and A keypress
[03:54:26] <Whirl3d> newbiee, you know that I was speaking in general terms, right...don't use the literal "#inputid" instead use "#"  and YOUR inputid...
[03:54:43] <newbiee> yeah i got that
[03:55:17] <Whirl3d> $(elem).keypress(function (e) { console.log(e.charChode, e.which, e.keyCode);}
[03:55:40] <Whirl3d> do something like that and see if you get different results for A and a...if so, use that ...
[03:56:05] <Whirl3d> I can't remember if charCode works or not come to think of it....might just be string method
[03:56:19] <Whirl3d> ?e
[03:56:20] <bot-t> Whirl3d, event.which - For key or button events, this attribute indicates the specific button or key that was pressed. http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[03:56:22] <fuchstronaut> when using .each, is there a way to just get back a slice of the jquerystack instead of getting a dom-element, than making a jquery-stack out of it and calling methods?
[03:57:58] <Whirl3d> do you mean $(this)
[03:58:40] <fuchstronaut> Whirl3d: yes, i think this is killing performance for me (as it uses 10% firebug tells me)
[03:58:42] <Whirl3d> $collection.each(function () {$(this)   is a jquery object, whereas   this is the element
[03:59:07] <fuchstronaut> I'm looking for a way to improve performance
[03:59:20] <Whirl3d> fuchstronaut, wrapping this in jquery is not it
[03:59:48] <Whirl3d> post your code at jsfiddle and you are more likely to get some input on ways to optimize
[04:00:01] <fuchstronaut> firebug tells me that 10% are used by pushStack of jQuery
[04:00:16] <fuchstronaut> though i dont know much about console.profile
[04:00:56] <Whirl3d> pushStack is internal to jQuery  I don't think there's any way around it. YOu could manually cycle through the jquery collection with a for-each loop
[04:01:24] <Whirl3d> is your code running slow or are you just tweaked out thinking it could be faster
[04:01:52] <Whirl3d> cause lord knows I have spent a great deal of time thinking the same thing when my code ran perfectly well in the first place. LOL
[04:01:52] <fuchstronaut> I'm building something like a jQuery excel
[04:02:19] <Whirl3d> Well excel is a dog, so don't worry about speed at all . lol
[04:02:30] <fuchstronaut> on loading a page i have to call a method for a number of fields
[04:02:39] <fuchstronaut> the method basicly executes userdefined functions
[04:02:45] <fuchstronaut> so i dont have control about that
[04:02:55] <fuchstronaut> all i can do is get the most out of my code
[04:03:10] <fuchstronaut> because if it takes to long while loading, firefox will ask the user to stop the script
[04:03:14] <fuchstronaut> thats something i dont want
[04:03:26] <Whirl3d> Than don't do them all at once
[04:03:31] <fuchstronaut> so, if they have to wait, it's fine, but i dont want the script to break
[04:03:39] <fuchstronaut> you think spliting will help?
[04:03:49] <Whirl3d> do them, post the update to the dom, satisfy them and firefox and do the next one
[04:03:53] <Whirl3d> usre
[04:03:55] <Whirl3d> sure
[04:04:09] <fuchstronaut> I'll try that
[04:04:11] <Whirl3d> it will take longer, but the user won't notice if the browser doesn't
[04:04:38] <Whirl3d> the thing is that it sucks when your computer is just running amuck and you don't know it until it crashes..
[04:04:58] <fuchstronaut> besides that, do you think i can get any extra-performance out of a js native loop compared to jquerys each?
[04:05:01] <Whirl3d> You could use deferred objects or callbacks to fire oneafter the other
[04:05:43] <Whirl3d> in a comparative study I once saw, the fastest looping was done where you said var c=items.length; while (c--) {do stuff}
[04:05:57] <Whirl3d> but it was only miniminally faster than other methods
[04:06:08] <Whirl3d> It's likely not the loop that is your bottleneck
[04:06:39] <fuchstronaut> no, it's the user defined functions
[04:06:50] <Whirl3d> what kind of functions are they?
[04:07:30] <fuchstronaut> it's kind-of-excel, so if you type a value in one field, several other fields have to be re-calculated
[04:07:32] <Whirl3d> and how are you mapping their text intput to functions? using eval()?
[04:08:04] <fuchstronaut> I'm storing the functions in an object as anonymous functions
[04:08:10] <fuchstronaut> their returnvalue is used
[04:08:15] <Whirl3d> so it's likely your event handlers
[04:08:23] <fuchstronaut> ye
[04:08:23] <Whirl3d> how are you handling the changed input events
[04:08:30] <fuchstronaut> change()
[04:08:37] <Whirl3d> on every cell?
[04:08:53] <fuchstronaut> on change i check if there are cells that depend on that changed fields value
[04:09:01] <fuchstronaut> if yes i run their functions
[04:09:16] <newbiee> i tried to focus to input using keypress but the key being pressed is also shown in the input box..how can i remove that
[04:09:18] <fuchstronaut> just on cells that can be altered by a user
[04:09:34] <fuchstronaut> newbiee: return false or preventDefault
[04:09:39] <Whirl3d> theres your problem
[04:09:47] <Whirl3d> you should have one event handler
[04:09:49] <Whirl3d> period
[04:09:57] <Whirl3d> it should handle the changes for all your cells
[04:09:59] <fuchstronaut> Whirl3d: can you explain what you mean
[04:10:32] <fuchstronaut> should i use delegate or something?
[04:10:37] <Whirl3d> table.on("change", ".cellclass", function (e) {var cell=$(this); do stuff)
[04:11:22] <fuchstronaut> is it really a difference?
[04:11:24] <fuchstronaut> ill try that
[04:11:26] <fuchstronaut> thank you
[04:11:30] <Whirl3d> then the table listens for the change event on your user-enabled cells only and if they change, it looks up the cell, applies it to the associated other cells
[04:11:37] <Whirl3d> HUGE difference I bet
[04:11:47] <Whirl3d> Also, how are you referencing the other cells?
[04:12:05] <Whirl3d> if cell a5 need to update b5, b6, b7   how do you know that?
[04:12:47] <fuchstronaut> i have that object and there is an array containing all cells that use it's value in their formula
[04:13:06] <GreekFreak> I have a button with the .button() function, and when I hover over it, it changes colour as per the theme. How can I make it so that it will always remain with the "hover colour" for this one button? What class do I need to give it?
[04:13:13] <Whirl3d> you could use the $.callbacks() object o to register a series of callbacks for each cell
[04:13:43] <Whirl3d> then if the cell changes, simply do $cell.data("callbacks").first($(cell).val());
[04:13:49] <Whirl3d> and boom they all get updated
[04:13:54] <Whirl3d> no looping or nothing
[04:14:37] <Whirl3d> then to add dependent cells, you could do $(celll).data('callbacks").add("newcellformula");
[04:15:32] <shoky> Whirl3d
[04:15:45] <shoky> no idea if this has anything to do with anything .. but.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pu5aA/1/
[04:15:46] <Whirl3d> yes
[04:15:54] <GreekFreak> ok, so if I add the .ui-state-hover, then it starts off like that, but as soon as I go off it, that class is removed..... any ideas?
[04:16:08] <shoky> dont know why im turning javascript into java :(
[04:16:18] <fuchstronaut> thank you Whirl3d, I'll try first what i can get by changing the event
[04:17:32] <fuchstronaut> can I use selectors with OR operators? like 'td.class_1 OR td.class_2 > input OR select' ?
[04:17:37] <fuchstronaut> something like this
[04:19:01] <fuchstronaut> funny, I'm still using jquery 1.6.2
[04:19:42] <shoky> fuchstronaut: yeah, use a comma
[04:20:16] <fuchstronaut> but comma will result in td.class_1 OR td_class_2 > input OR select
[04:20:43] <fuchstronaut> sorry my question was stupid
[04:20:47] <shoky> wat
[04:21:07] <fuchstronaut> i ment something like (td.class_1 OR td.class_2) > (input OR select)
[04:21:20] <fuchstronaut> so any of these two classes with any of these to childelements
[04:21:44] <shoky> putting all that logic into one selector string seems fugly to me, even if it was possible
[04:22:23] <shoky> $('td.class_1, td.class_2').children('input,select')
[04:23:11] <fuchstronaut> I need a selector for my on()
[04:23:23] <shoky> ah
[04:23:27] <blackspotwiggins> fuchstronaut, :input maybe
[04:24:30] <blackspotwiggins> $(".class1, .class").on("stuff", ":input", dostuff)
[04:24:51] <shoky> dont think that's what he asked for
[04:25:23] <shoky> he wants  .on('stuff', '(td.class_1 OR td.class_2) > (input OR select)', fn)
[04:25:49] <fuchstronaut> hm, i have the feeling that I'm getting better performance out of change() using chained children()-methods than with on() using a complicated selector
[04:26:07] <fuchstronaut> css-selectors are nice, but if it comes to performance complicated ones are really messy
[04:26:12] <shoky> i'd just check the event.target myself
[04:28:46] <blackspotwiggins> shoky, yea im missing td, otherwise should work
[04:29:11] <Rovanion> Is it possible to animate to the natural height of an element?
[04:29:26] <blackspotwiggins> Rovanion, on some browsers, it seems to work
[04:30:34] <Rovanion> blackspotwiggins: What arguments do I throw $.animate?
[04:33:28] <fuchstronaut> Whirl3d: thanks, the while(c--) loop just gave me 10% on that loading thing
[04:34:12] <fuchstronaut> just need to find 9 other tweaks, than it's instant ;P
[04:37:34] <mazzachre> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/5VXvH/ This is what I am looking for... I know it is kind of impossible in some ways, but perhaps I can get the html mended in ways to make it easier...
[04:38:48] <Whirl3d> fuchstronaut. you don't need any complicated selector. gimme a second and I'll show you what I mean...
[04:40:16] <blackspotwiggins> Rovanion, you can try height: auto
[04:41:07] <mazzachre> I have this problem, simplified here http://jsfiddle.net/5VXvH/ I want to replace a bunch of radio inputs with a block containing a single text based on the selected radio button... I have based it on the html I have been given, if at all possible I should not replace the html, but it might be nessecary... I have no idea where to go from here
[04:41:11] <Whirl3d> fuchstronaut http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BswkB/9/
[04:43:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BswkB/10/
[04:44:22] <Whirl3d> that'll make more sense. when you have an input field focused and you click on another element, it adds that elements id to your input value
[04:48:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BswkB/14/
[04:48:48] <Whirl3d> closer

[04:52:30] <j0nr> Hello folks. I am new to jquery. I am trying to perform 2 actions on a toggle event. Currently when I click on the handler, I have a toggle to slideUp and slideDown, this works.
[04:52:50] <j0nr> I call it by  $('label').toggle(function() { ...
[04:53:12] <j0nr> I want to also change a css property of a child div.
[04:53:27] <j0nr> erm, shall I try and put it in a jsFiddle
[04:57:58] <Zhy> j0nr by doing so you'd increase the  chances for people to help you ;>
[05:01:48] <tansaku> hmm, am trying to get cursor to appear in inputbox, but focus() does not appear to be working ...
[05:03:10] <j0nr> ok.... http://jsfiddle.net/uAz3H/5/
[05:03:29] <j0nr> rudimentary, but when a 'label' is clicked on it reveals the nested UL
[05:04:17] <j0nr> what is NOT showing it the icons.png, but all that is an image of a + and -. '+' shows when the nested ul is collapsed... I want to toggle the background-position o at the same time I expand my ul
[05:04:25] <j0nr> to show the '-'
[05:06:20] <j0nr> so something like $(this).css('background-position','new_pos');   but I have to make sure I select only the active div.folderTree
[05:07:08] <sgflt> is there a way to scrape (i.e. get html contents) of foreign pages that does not run afound the Access-Control-Allow-Origin ?
[05:08:16] <blackspotwiggins> sgflt, possibly with iframes
[05:08:19] <blackspotwiggins> if you mean in browser
[05:08:49] <sgflt> blackspotwiggins, but i cannot access the iframe then and manipulate it, can i?
[05:09:42] <Thoemchen> hey guys, I'm having a "<td id="foo">                  my text                    </td>" (it has tabulator intends to make the sourcecode prettier) - trying to get the data with $('#foo').html() or $('#foo').text() it returns the value with the tabs. Is it possible to trim that in one step?
[05:10:04] <blackspotwiggins> sgflt, i think you can.. but not the other way around
[05:10:21] <blackspotwiggins> might be different by browser
[05:10:57] <Billy_> Cork: are you around?
[05:11:06] <Cork> sure
[05:11:17] <Billy_> i have a question
[05:11:28] <Billy_> about the $.ajax request
[05:11:50] <Billy_> when i am using the ajax request at the same server it is working perfectly
[05:12:26] <Billy_> when i try to use the same service from the other domain it is giving the error message
[05:12:49] <Cork> Billy_: yup, thats cross domain
[05:12:56] <Cork> and browsers block that by default
[05:13:18] <Billy_> then is there any way to do that
[05:13:20] <Cork> in some modern browsers you can control this with a http header
[05:13:31] <Cork> Billy_: cross browser, no
[05:13:41] <Cork> if you don't have control of the server on the other domain, no
[05:13:43] <Zhy> j0nr active div.folderTree would be the one clicked and expanded?
[05:13:59] <Stefunel> if for ajax calls, the async false is now deprecated, how can I still make a sync call?
[05:14:07] <sgflt> Billy_, if you control the server you're trying to get stuff from, set proper Access-Control headers.
[05:14:18] <sgflt> Billy_, otherwise, set up some sort of proxy or use YQL
[05:14:28] <Cork> ?mdc http access
[05:14:28] <bot-t> Cork, HTTP access control (CORS) - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control
[05:21:38] <Billy_> Cork: thankx but how to do that in asmx file .net webservices
[05:21:59] <Cork> Billy_: never done that
[05:22:01] <Cork> so donno
[05:22:40] <Billy_> sgflt : i try to use the yql but when i passing the query string in it. yql giving me error
[05:23:05] <Billy_> Cork: thanks for the support
[05:23:35] <Billy_> Cork: jQuery.support.cors = true; // force cross-site scripting (as of jQuery 1.5)
[05:24:15] <Billy_> it is only in 1.5 version of jquery
[05:25:44] <uamam> what method should I use if I want to check if any of the inputs are empty? To avoid registrering without every input being filled.
[05:26:30] <yuka> hi lads
[05:26:50] <yuka> anybody knows a jquery tag cloud script that would enable me using a picture to display tags on?
[05:27:00] <yuka> something similair to woordle effect
[05:32:41] <jmaister> hai
[05:33:23] <jmaister> shouldn't this return every child element that doesn't have the class has_changed? `$(this).children(":not(.has_changed)")`
[05:34:24] <Whirl3d> shoky, first of all thanks for doing all that. Second of all, wtf? I understood everything up until (line 2--just kidding) the ControllerFactory....I just don't get that part of the code. It seems backwards or something...can you explain, maybe?
[05:38:35] <Bjornet> Hi there, I want to find the opposite selector to the addition sign $(selector + selector);
[05:39:02] <Bjornet> Goal: to select the previous element
[05:39:25] <Bjornet> and not use the .prev() method. Is there any such selector?
[05:40:24] <shoky> heh Whirl3d i just made that ControllerFactory cause you said you want to generate different implementations based on content type
[05:41:48] <Cork> Billy_: warning though, that doesn't work with ie
[05:42:18] <shoky> so the factory provides you with a new controller instance of whatever type you ask for
[05:43:31] <shoky> bbl
[05:45:29] <mazzachre> Is there some easy way to make a replacement object? Say I have an input field, and I want to replace that with a <span> I want the span to take up the exact same space as the input field does... how do I do that?
[05:46:55] <jmaister> mazzachre: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419749/get-selected-elements-outer-html ?
[05:47:04] <Cork> var span = $('<span/>'); span.css({ display: 'inline-block', width: input.width(), height: input.height }).text(input.val()); input.replaceWith(span);
[05:47:18] <Cork> *var span = $('<span/>'); span.css({ display: 'inline-block', width: input.width(), height: input.height() }).text(input.val()); input.replaceWith(span);

[05:54:07] <ajpiano> when it's ready
[05:54:36] <zim> Like I said I know there is no real answer just after a best guess
[05:55:04] <ajpiano> possibly this autumn
[05:55:28] <zim> TY thats what I was after
[05:56:52] <zim> In that case what would people use that work like the Tooltips widget planed in 1.9
[05:57:01] <mazzachre> jmaister: That did not quite do what I expected...
[05:57:20] <fusion27> I don't talk programming as well as I do it.  I have one of these --> http://pastie.org/4154234, which I believe is a JS object?
[05:57:25] <fusion27> I wanna build one of those dynamically with the return from an ajax $.get()
[05:57:36] <ajpiano> zim, nothing is stopping you from using the most current release of 1.9 milestone in production :)
[05:57:48] <fusion27> not sure of how to google this one
[05:57:51] <granden> If I got a few lines of code that I want to be runned during a mouse over. I could use .hover(), but if exiting the element before all animations etc functions have been runned. I want it to be completed.
[05:58:05] <ajpiano> fusion27: that's an array of objects
[05:58:15] <zim> Ah OK. How stable is it?
[05:58:19] <sacho> fusion27, it's an array of objects.
[05:58:26] <ajpiano> zim: a few horses live there
[05:58:27] <ajpiano> GET IT
[05:58:29] <ajpiano> HOW STABLE
[05:58:30] <ajpiano> IS IT
[05:58:31] <sacho> fusion27, it sounds like you need a tutorial.
[05:58:32] <fusion27> ajpiano: I want to push objects on an array then...
[05:58:42] <fusion27> yeah
[05:58:50] <fusion27> I'm not sure of how to google the right tutorial
[05:58:51] <ajpiano> ?mdc push

[05:59:08] <fusion27> tx ajpiano
[05:59:30] <ajpiano> zim: it's relatively stable
[05:59:40] <zim> ajpiano: ty will give it a go.
[06:01:10] <mazzachre> Cork: That is very like what I have done, however the input element is somewhat bigger (counting for some border of the element) so the text inside the new span is cut off at the bottom (so a y looks like a v)
[06:01:34] <jmaister> mazzachre: How about `$(selector).attr("outerHTML")`?
[06:01:46] <blackspotwiggins> attr? really?
[06:02:15] <mazzachre> jmaister: Does not return anything...
[06:02:40] <mazzachre> jmaister: I get the html with that function you sent me, but what I want is the size of that html...
[06:03:26] <zim> ajpiano: Probably being a nupty but where do I download it from?

[06:04:15] <Cork> mazzachre: input { box-sizing: border-box; }
[06:04:27] <zim> ajpiano: TY
[06:04:31] <Cork> mazzachre: input elements has weird padding by default
[06:04:38] <Julien_`> concerning custom events
[06:04:46] <Cork> or rather weird box model by default
[06:04:51] <Julien_`> the custom event have to be trigger like this
[06:05:05] <Julien_`> $(el).trigger('....')
[06:05:23] <Julien_`> but couldn't be like in PHP :
[06:05:37] <Julien_`> $.trigger('customevents)  ?
[06:06:47] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya, I know... I have no idea how to fix my problem though... What I do is very like your exmple... Except I use replaceWith(function()) but otherwise it is like it... I then use overflow: hidden to hide long texts (I set the value as title too, for mouse over) but the text that is shown in the span looks different and is cut off before... I have no idea what to do about it...
[06:07:29] <Cork> mazzachre: are you copying over the font from the input fields?
[06:07:44] <Cork> form elements use different fonts then the rest of the page
[06:07:54] <mazzachre> Cork: No, I currently only copy width and height
[06:08:22] <mazzachre> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/5VXvH/1/
[06:08:35] <mazzachre> Cork: The Select elements get all wierd :s
[06:09:21] <Cork> uh...
[06:09:27] <Cork> your copying over the options too?
[06:10:59] <mazzachre> Cork: I copy the selected values for select boxes... This might be changed somewhat though...
[06:11:07] <Billy_> Cork: thanks for the help. Thanks alot
[06:11:45] <zim> ajpiano: in the 1.9 dev download is there an include all script of do I have to add a line for each file?
[06:12:34] <ajpiano> pretty sure there's a concatted file in there somewhere, look around in the directories
[06:12:36] <zim> I am looking at the demo's an they seem to include only the required files
[06:12:54] <zim> ty will dig about
[06:13:06] <mazzachre> Cork: I have been given the task of replacing a form with set values with a read only version after somethign is set... My first solution, which works and have been accepted was to run through each element and put "disabled" on them... all is ok, but now some customer wants a "true" read only html version where all the form elements are replaced with static html elements with the values in them...
[06:14:06] <ajpiano> zim: in your download folder in ui and min... jquery-ui.js and jquery-ui.min.js
[06:14:12] <zim> mazzachre: can't you just add a class to the elements and hit them in one go?
[06:14:28] <zim> ajpiano: ty
[06:14:56] <mazzachre> zim: it is not a problem of finding and hiding them.. it is a problem of showing something else in stead, that actually works as expected...
[06:15:29] <zim> based on what?
[06:16:19] <jeffsmykil> Where are the ajax calls displayed in chrome?  In firebug it is in the console.
[06:16:34] <Cork> mazzachre: i would just loop over the elements and use .val() in combination with its type
[06:16:42] <zim> sounds like it will be much easier to just pull in the new/working form via ajax
[06:16:46] <Cork> mazzachre: and prob have css rules to make them look nice
[06:16:59] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: in the network panel
[06:17:08] <johnkpaul> it could also be in the regular console,but that's an option I think
[06:17:14] <jeffsmykil> johnty
[06:17:47] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: the option in the dev tools settings pane is "log xmlhttprequests"
[06:17:55] <johnkpaul> and then it'll show up in the console
[06:17:57] <mazzachre> zim: When I have an input element with value="test" I want to replace that with a <span> with text="test"... No problem, I can do that, however I don't want the element to be bigger than the input element was, so I set css(height and width with the input elements heigh and width, which is where the trouble starts, because now the new span is not the same height as the label that goes with the input element... And it is not alligned
[06:17:57] <mazzachre> to the same baseline
[06:20:17] <zim> Ah. OK when I did somthing like that I had huge problems with ie/ff/etc as they all render a little diff so in the end I just made a class that made the input box look like a span and toggled the classes
[06:22:56] <Cork> zim: thats the box-sizing
[06:23:29] <Cork> and changing that should make it fairly simple to make a span behave similar
[06:24:19] <mazzachre> zim: But the customer does not want any form elements, only static html element... So no input/select/textarea etc...
[06:24:26] <mazzachre> zim: formatted or otherwise..
[06:24:31] <mazzachre> :(
[06:25:20] <mazzachre> Cork: I can see the problem, I just can't understand why it is there... It is no longer an input element, so why does the text behave differently from the text element next to it?
[06:25:53] <Cork> mazzachre: do you have the link again?
[06:26:01] <zim> mazzachre: when you make what ever work is it individual items or the whole form?
[06:26:55] <mazzachre> Cork: I got it... however it does not help me much.. since it just gives me the outer html, and those does not have the needed values...
[06:27:34] <mazzachre> zim: I iterate through the individual elements replacing them as I come by them
[06:27:44] <Cork> mazzachre: so you want the html representation to include the options for the select box too?
[06:27:52] <Cork> but why?
[06:27:58] <Cork> isn't it meant to be static?
[06:28:17] <mazzachre> Cork: Not all the options for the select box... Only the selected one
[06:28:26] <rohanrhu> I've created a nice looking button with div tag using input: submits. After, I'm having them sumbit on .click() method. But Im not having expected result. .ajaxForm() is randomly submitting the form, and there are many ajaxes on the page. When all ajaxes are loaded / successed, handlers are redefining repeatedly..
[06:28:29] <mazzachre> Cork: Or in case of multiple select, all the selected ones
[06:28:31] <Cork> ah, you want the value not the option
[06:28:34] <rohanrhu> Do you have any suggestions?
[06:28:40] <mazzachre> Cork: Yes
[06:29:04] <Cork> mazzachre: so select.find('[value="' + select.val() + '"]).text()
[06:29:04] <mazzachre> Cork: Or actually, for select boxes, I want the display.. so the option.text()
[06:29:23] <zim> mazzachre: I know what you are doing was just wondering if it would be quicker to post the content and pull it back via ajax or store it in session and just pull in the form when needed
[06:29:28] <mazzachre> Cork: No, I do select.find(':selected').text()
[06:29:35] <rohanrhu> can you help me?
[06:29:38] <Cork> ah, that works too
[06:30:42] <mazzachre> zim: I was wondering that as well... But apparently that is not the question currently (I have no idea what is generating the form... I would probably be better off trying to change that code instead...
[06:31:32] <zim> mazzachre: Yup ugly patches only get uglier :-)
[06:33:51] <mazzachre> zim: Yep... and as consultant I usually get the enviable job of fixing these hacks when stuff starts to go wrong...
[06:34:35] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know of any good libraries with the same menu as microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx?pvti=0&mnui=7 ?
[06:34:58] <zim> mazzachre: then some upstart starts dicking with tidy code and hacks it to death and you start all over again. Well it pays the bills
[06:35:45] <mazzachre> zim: And then you die... :D
[06:37:11] <jmaister> argh. really struggeling witht this. How can I select all children that does not have a given class?
[06:37:36] <xec> .children(":not(.class)") ?
[06:38:13] <mazzachre> zim: You have not seen the worst of this code however :) All layout is done via tables and tables in tables... Then there was some table data (columns and rows) which were laid out with divs that were moved into position to be showed as a table...
[06:38:36] <jeffreylevesque> .children("!(.class)")?
[06:38:39] <jmaister> xec: Yeah, tried that, but I get the exception: "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded"
[06:38:58] <zim> mazzachre: start over it will be faster
[06:39:22] <jmaister> zim: you forgot a comma ^^
[06:39:25] <mazzachre> zim: Ya, try and convince the client about that...
[06:40:18] <xec> jmaister: http://jsfiddle.net/MS77w/
[06:40:23] <jmaister> jeffreylevesque: "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: !(.class)" I don't think that'll work
[06:40:27] <zim> mazzachre: Just expain that it will cost less as it take $x time to find/fix a problem.
[06:40:53] <xec> jmaister: or better, use .not() http://jsfiddle.net/MS77w/1/
[06:41:23] <jmaister> xec: So maby I've got too many child elements for it to handle?
[06:41:48] <xec> jmaister: i think you're doing something else wrong, show us your code?
[06:42:53] <jeffreylevesque> maybe specifying a parent html element .children(".myContainer:not(.class)")
[06:43:13] <xec> jeffreylevesque: that won't be a parent element
[06:43:23] <jeffreylevesque> (".myContainer:not(.class)")
[06:43:36] <jeffreylevesque> sorry i pasted from somthing else
[06:45:00] <granden> is there any function I could add before a fadeIn() or similayr so all other animations is runned before that is exequeted?

[06:48:48] <rohanrhu> can you help me
[06:49:03] <Julien_`> i xwonder if special event can be user as observer that not relies on DOM element ?
[06:49:11] <rohanrhu> shoky:
[06:49:14] <laszlof> rohanrhu: I'd suggest not cornering people, its rude.
[06:49:26] <xec> rohanrhu: don't look for experts, ask the channel and wait for a response
[06:50:09] <Julien_`> can we fire special event without DOM element ?
[06:50:11] <sacho> Julien_`, what problem are you trying to solve
[06:50:11] <xec> jmaister: what exactly are you trying to do with this code, how is it supposed to behave?
[06:50:16] <laszlof> rohanrhu: if you're submitting via ajax, make sure you return false at the end of the click event to prevent the normal submit action
[06:50:29] <rohanrhu> laszlof: yes returning false
[06:50:33] <sacho> Julien_`, who is listening to that event? How do they subscribe?
[06:50:45] <sacho> How do you fire it? Who is its event dispatcher?
[06:50:45] <laszlof> rohanrhu: paste your code to jsfiddel
[06:50:48] <laszlof> jsfiddle
[06:50:57] <jmaister> xec: As stated: I want to remove all fields that hasn't been changed, so that only fields with changes is submitted on POST
[06:51:00] <rohanrhu> laszlof: after ajaxform submit, new form is coming with response
[06:51:02] <Julien_`> sacho: i want to register event and then fire it
[06:51:13] <Julien_`> when this event is fire i want to capture it
[06:51:13] <sacho> Then implement all that I just mentioned.
[06:51:24] <rohanrhu> laszlof: thank you im pasting
[06:51:31] <Julien_`> it's more like oberver pattren that event functionlatily
[06:51:56] <rohanrhu> laszlof: http://jsfiddle.net/Lz3VF/
[06:51:57] <Julien_`> ... yes i want observer pattern that not relies on DOM event
[06:52:09] <sacho> then make one
[06:52:20] <Julien_`> .. :)
[06:52:28] <rohanrhu> laszlof: after ajaxform submit, same form is coming with response and im putting it to same div
[06:52:29] <sacho> or google for an existing
[06:52:40] <xec> jmaister: the checkboxes only? or the texts as well
[06:52:41] <Julien_`> ok but it seems that $.deferred is noot far that what i want ...
[06:53:06] <Julien_`> i want to lanch an event in a class and get it in another class
[06:53:14] <jmaister> xec: all inputs and textareas
[06:53:18] <rohanrhu> laszlof: so, i must redefine all handlers (ajaxform handler, submit button to submit button as div)
[06:53:56] <rohanrhu> laszlof: http://88.238.168.67/animesitesi/anime/bolum/another-bolum-1-izle/izle.html
[06:54:03] <rohanrhu> problem in comments
[06:54:07] <jmaister> xec: I guess narrowing the "change" event handler to only input and textarea will optimize the code a bit
[06:54:24] <xec> jmaister: ok, i think your approach is okay, just need tweaking, yes. the * is a bad idea
[06:55:23] <xec> jmaister: and i'm not sure why you're doing .off() this and that?
[06:55:50] <jmaister> xec: To be truly honest, me neither.
[06:56:38] <gadlol> Hello, i am using this: $('#content').on('click',$('.elem'),function(){   console.log($(this));   }); But it outputs the content not the element wich has been click...
[06:56:39] <DeltaHeavy> I think I have a really trivial bug but it's just not clicking with me what-so-ever. The console.log is returning (0, 2) when the loop should be running 3 times and returning 0,1,2. Anybody know what it is? Problem I think is with the for loop at line 7: http://pastebin.com/TrE0mmii
[06:57:06] <gadlol> How to make it so to get the clicked .elem div?
[06:57:59] <jmaister> xec: Seems it was a bug for iOS where it would loop the event if you didn't shut it off.
[06:58:21] <jmaister> But it should be OK now. Time to trim code :)
[06:58:48] <sacho> DeltaHeavy, you're using a global i. addToCart probably uses the same global i and modifies it.
[06:59:07] <xec> jmaister: lykke til :)
[06:59:19] <DeltaHeavy> sacho: That would explain it. Thanks! Pretty sure that's it now that I think about it. Will try it now
[06:59:21] <jmaister> xec: Takker ;)
[06:59:21] <sacho> DeltaHeavy, use strict, etc.
[06:59:23] <scar> if i want to use SQL to store cities and states, and when someone selects a state from my dropdown it queries and pulls the cities in that state from my database-- would this be difficult?
[07:00:31] <DeltaHeavy> scar: Nope, pretty easy
[07:00:50] <DeltaHeavy> Just need some server side code and $.ajax
[07:03:51] <rohanrhu> gadlol: $(this).html()
[07:04:28] <rohanrhu> laszlof:
[07:05:15] <gadlol> rohanrhu: the problem is that the this is refered to the parent div with id = content not the clicked element
[07:06:19] <Julien_`> sacho: this is what i nedd : https://gist.github.com/661855 :)
[07:06:36] <Julien_`> but i was wondering how to implement this with $.callbacks
[07:06:53] <scar> DeltaHeavy: do you know of a simple, helpful tutorial for basics?
[07:06:55] <rohanrhu> gadlol: paste the code
[07:07:19] <gadlol> $('#content').on('click',$('.elem'),function(){   console.log($(this));   });
[07:08:05] <Billy_> gud night friends
[07:08:41] <gadlol> I figured it out
[07:09:07] <gadlol> in the selector i was putting $('.elem') but it should be '.elem'
[07:09:17] <gadlol> thanx anyway
[07:09:23] <depy> what's the difference between Deffered objects, promises and   when/then ?
[07:14:47] <gadlol>  $(this).removeClass('class1').addClass('class2');  Can that be better coded? Because it is executed lots of times during  dragging of div
[07:15:05] <QueueQueue> Does anyone have any recommendations for good programming podcasts?
[07:15:43] <J4M> gadlol: you might need a return false somewhere
[07:15:58] <J4M> or an if statement
[07:16:08] <gadlol> Look: if(event.pageX<dragX) $(this).removeClass('movementRight').addClass('movementLeft'); else $(this).removeClass('movementLeft').addClass('movementRight');
[07:16:14] <gadlol> thats what i have
[07:16:18] <gadlol> but its ugly
[07:17:22] <J4M> if the class only needs to be changed when the css isn't changed, use an if for that
[07:17:58] <NodeX> toggleClass @ gadlol ?
[07:18:08] <gadlol> xmmm
[07:18:13] <rvsjoen> anyone have a clue why this stops auto-scrolling after inputting 20 lines or so ? http://jsfiddle.net/czhXS/1/
[07:18:22] <gadlol> yes i did not think of toggleClass
[07:19:02] <NodeX> rvsjoen does it do it in your script or just inside jsfiddle ?
[07:19:07] <rvsjoen> both
[07:19:23] <J4M> I'm using $('#divhere').draggable(); but I want a child element to not drag the entire div, how would I go about doing this?
[07:19:36] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone
[07:19:44] <jarr0dsz> anyone can recommend a good clean small sound player for jquery?
[07:19:56] <J4M> my I found myObject.draggable( 'disable' )
[07:19:59] <J4M> oh*
[07:20:11] <jarr0dsz> i basically only want to play a piece of mp3 on a certain page it has to be loaded on page load dont need fancy full libs like soundmanager those are to big
[07:20:21] <jarr0dsz> but needs cross browser, is that possible without using flash?
[07:20:23] <rvsjoen> it seems to be due to the height property on the div
[07:20:36] <NodeX> rvsjoen : good point , it's not the non scrolling, the submission is not happening
[07:21:30] <NodeX> my mistake,it is and it's down to your overflow:hidden property
[07:21:50] <NodeX> scrollTop wont work with that property set without relative position iirc
[07:22:13] <J4M> Disabling the draggable for a child div doesn't seem to keep it from controlling the parent
[07:22:23] <NodeX> you need a second div in there to do it
[07:22:24] <Woet> jarr0dsz: html5 and the oldschool embed
[07:22:29] <rvsjoen> hm
[07:23:49] <NodeX> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1193414/scrolling-a-div-with-jquery <---- describes the concept to get it to work
[07:24:20] <rvsjoen> thanks
[07:24:30] <jarr0dsz> Woet: yes i know but wanted something non embedded
[07:24:38] <Woet> jarr0dsz: ?
[07:24:41] <jarr0dsz> think i go for soundmanger in the end seems they made it lots smaller since last time
[07:24:59] <jarr0dsz> hoped there sould be something just plug and play soundmanger is quite some work to implement in my webapp
[07:25:02] <NodeX> http://www.switchonthecode.com/tutorials/using-jquery-slider-to-scroll-a-div <-- seems to do it also - just dont use the UI parts
[07:25:17] <Woet> jarr0dsz: what is wrong with html5?
[07:25:30] <jarr0dsz> nothing i love html5 but its not supported cross browser eh
[07:25:39] <J4M> the opensource browsers won't play mp3
[07:26:23] <J4M> you can use ogg though
[07:35:37] <anew> anyone??? this plugin from yesterday http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/  line 3 in mktsignup.js what is "password" refering to i have no idea
[07:36:15] <ajpiano> yea i was it's creating a new validator method called "password"
[07:37:05] <kotya> hi
[07:37:19] <kotya> i need to do cross-domain ajax calls in my projet
[07:37:46] <kotya> i added Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * to headers and it works, but without cookies
[07:38:07] <anew> ajpiano but how does it know where to place that method on the page? i dont understand
[07:38:11] <kotya> i.e. if i make ajax call from site A to site B , there are no cookies for B available on B site
[07:38:16] <kotya> how can i solve this issue?
[07:38:18] <ajpiano> anew: it's creating a new validator method called "password", which is in turn invoked by the markup conventions on the form
[07:38:55] <anew> i cant find where the id or class is being called to place the error message ?
[07:39:50] <ajpiano> i imagine that's baked into the validation plugin
[07:40:08] <ajpiano> that when a field fails, it puts the message next to the field
[07:40:19] <anew> so using this plugin for example... i would have to build my html around what the plugin says
[07:40:24] <anew> or edit the plugin
[07:40:39] <ajpiano> yes, this plugin works mostly by markup conventions with some config injs
[07:40:54] <ajpiano> anew: i really strongly recommend that you don't learn js application development by studying this one example of the validation plugin
[07:41:11] <anew> yeah i just didnt want to move on until i knew what was happening here
[07:41:34] <anew> how do u think i should learn js application dev then ?
[07:41:44] <ajpiano> thats like saying "i didn't want to learn how to put a saddle on a horse until i knew how to play polo"
[07:41:51] <ajpiano> by starting with putting the saddle on the horse
[07:42:27] <anew> lol
[07:42:27] <ajpiano> start at the beginning
[07:42:41] <bartmax> hi ajpiano
[07:42:47] <ajpiano> hi bartmax
[07:43:01] <bartmax> ajpiano: still wondering if you don't want to live/work mmm lets say 1 year in uruguay? :D
[07:43:13] <anew> bartmax ur in uruguay ?
[07:43:20] <bartmax> I am
[07:43:20] <ajpiano> i can confirm that i definitely don't want to move to uruguay
[07:43:28] <bartmax> :(
[07:43:29] <anew> damn that's awesome
[07:43:32] <anew> ajpiano where u live ?
[07:43:33] <ajpiano> unless i get to hang out with diego forlan
[07:43:34] <ajpiano> all the time
[07:43:39] <ajpiano> new york city
[07:43:47] <anew> man, go to uruguay !
[07:43:48] <bartmax> ajpiano: ... mmmm let me see if I can arrange that :D
[07:44:13] <anew> 1 yr in uruguay sounds awesome... ur right next to rio and buenos aires
[07:44:19] <anew> and the girls are supposed to be gorgeous
[07:44:22] <seutje> but so far from NYC
[07:44:26] <ajpiano> lemme just run that by my gf
[07:44:26] <anew> mfw ajpiano did not accept
[07:44:30] <anew> ah
[07:44:31] <anew> lol
[07:44:36] <bartmax> hahah anew, you know here ?
[07:44:44] <ajpiano> now that we've been linving together for 2 days, i'm sure she'll be down with moving to uruguay for a year
[07:44:45] <ajpiano> lol
[07:44:53] <seutje> ajpiano: hah, didn't she *JUST* move in?
[07:44:54] <anew> nope never been, but sounds like a sweet deal
[07:44:58] <seutje> lol yea
[07:45:00] <ajpiano> seutje: like i said, 2 days
[07:45:03] <ajpiano> :D
[07:45:07] <bartmax> lol
[07:45:09] <seutje> ajpiano: SORRY I DON'T TYPE AS FAST AS YOU
[07:45:12] <anew> i'm american and live in barcelona......and i would pick anywhere other than america to live in the world
[07:45:16] <ajpiano> YOU BETTER APOLOGISE
[07:45:19] <anew> once u see what other countries are like america - fail
[07:45:27] <seutje> ajpiano: TELL HER I SAID OHAI
[07:45:29] <ajpiano> anew: nyc and america are two different things ;)
[07:45:40] <seutje> urugay is still in the americas :D
[07:45:57] <anew> maybe.. but even nyc... big cities in europe blow it away imo
[07:45:58] <seutje> there's another u in there somewhere, isn't there?
[07:46:15] <anew> however northeast and pacific northwest are the only two places worth living in the states
[07:46:16] <seutje> I dunno, I kinda liked NYC when visiting
[07:46:31] <NodeX> it's all soon to be one giant NAFTA isn't it ?
[07:46:31] <seutje> that is, aside from the blatant flaming racists and lack of good pastry
[07:46:36] <bartmax> i would love to know nyc and live at least for some time with all the techy people, know gplex, universities... that's missing here
[07:46:39] <NodeX> NAU (north american union)
[07:47:00] <anew> nyc way overrated
[07:47:15] <bartmax> there's no uruguayan that knows about javascript, so forget workshops and the like...
[07:47:18] <anew> but i am biased so take what i say with a grain of salt
[07:47:18] <ajpiano> WATCH YO SELF
[07:47:21] <bartmax> for example.
[07:47:28] <seutje> and having a guy go "yo man, you got a cigarette, I'll give u a bag of coke for it" at like 2pm felt kinda off
[07:47:40] <anew> rofl @ seutje
[07:47:45] <NodeX> sounds like a good deal lol
[07:47:59] <seutje> INORITE? can't believe I gave him the cigarette for free
[07:48:19] <NodeX> should'a jacked his stash, new jack city styleee
[07:48:24] <seutje> ajpiano: YOU BETTER STEP DOWN FROM YOUR THRONE!!
[07:48:26] <NodeX> Color money Brothers
[07:48:27] <anew> well anyway real cool group here, from all over the world that's great
[07:48:51] <anew> bartmax what's the pay i uruguay for a jq dev there ? just curious

[07:50:03] <NodeX> lmao
[07:50:05] <anew> lol at a year
[07:50:12] <bartmax> but if you are ajpiano, that number goes a lot more. (per month 13 months/year)
[07:50:12] <anew> even per month that's low isnt it
[07:50:30] <anew> bartmax u have skype ?

[08:17:33] <duffyblackpeace> hi, got a strange problem, hoping someone has experienced it before, I have a plugin prepend() some html elements for a slider nav
[08:17:42] <duffyblackpeace> and I have classes set up to style them in css
[08:17:57] <duffyblackpeace> the css only works after I inspect element
[08:18:19] <duffyblackpeace> is is as though it needs to redraw or something
[08:19:28] <shoky> J4M: $('#div1').draggable({ cancel: '#div2-dont-drag' })
[08:19:43] <J4M> thanks a lot shoky
[08:20:52] <J4M> and works here
[08:23:51] <blackspotwiggins> duffyblackpeace, in IE ?
[08:24:19] <duffyblackpeace> nah chrome
[08:24:23] <duffyblackpeace> only chrome
[08:24:34] <duffyblackpeace> works fine in all other browsers
[08:25:07] <blackspotwiggins> i've had to force reflows in IE
[08:25:10] <blackspotwiggins> not sure about chrome
[08:25:29] <duffyblackpeace> yeah, strange, never seen anything like it.
[08:28:46] <shoky> can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle?
[08:33:19] <GhostBear> Hello. I have element in variable, how do I select elements with specific class inside my initial element?
[08:34:20] <zoned> .
[08:34:25] <lotus> GhostBear, you mean like... var element = $('selector');
[08:34:35] <GhostBear> yes, i have something like this
[08:34:35] <zoned> does anyone know how you can tell the iphone browser to DOWNLOAD a file instead of open it? i tried sending the file as binary, but then nothing happens when you click the link
[08:34:37] <lotus> element.find('childElementSelector');
[08:34:42] <Brodingo> ?find @ GhostBear
[08:34:47] <bot-t> GhostBear, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[08:34:49] <GhostBear> Thanks, this is what I wanted
[08:35:02] <GhostBear> was unsure what keywords should I use to find needed method
[08:39:04] <jarr0dsz> anyone might happen to know a solution for : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11206401/convert-variable-as-symbol-and-pass ?
[08:39:33] <jarr0dsz> have it on todo list im not sure how to approach it :( must be something very simple like conversion or so
[09:03:46] <anew> so how come here if i set a breakpoint on line 3 in mktsignup.js the script does not pause when i enter a short password and hit next http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/
[09:06:30] <sacho> set it on line 4.
[09:06:53] <sacho> line 3 is executed on document.ready() which has nothing to do with entering passwords or whatever
[09:07:19] <anew> hmm very good
[09:07:43] <anew> and line 4 is executed later
[09:08:46] <anew> what is the div name tho that line 4 is modifying
[09:09:41] <sacho> ..what?
[09:09:52] <anew> i mean not the div
[09:10:07] <anew> but where in the js is it modifying the page? i dont understand how it knows where to put the error message exactly
[09:11:43] <shoky> anew, the plugin takes care of that
[09:12:20] <anew> right i'm stepping thru the plugin still cant find where it is written
[09:12:37] <shoky> stepping through the plugin when the form is submitted?
[09:12:55] <shoky> or when the validation takes place, that is
[09:13:02] <shoky> not on page load
[09:13:16] <anew> i set the breakpoint for line 4... then i enter a short password and hit next... so now the js is triggered and paused at my bp
[09:13:32] <anew> then i keep stepping and cant find where in the plugin it says where to display the message
[09:15:27] <shoky> anew: line 640 in jquery.validate.js
[09:15:45] <shoky> label.html(message);   is setting the actual error text
[09:15:56] <anew> damn how u found that so fast
[09:16:04] <sacho> anew, in formatAndAdd()
[09:16:21] <shoky> i just stepped through it till it got to actually changing an element's text..
[09:16:40] <anew> sick
[09:17:50] <pingec> Does anyone know if I can parse and modify xml with jquery or a plugin? I'd need some well formated xml output
[09:19:28] <Jon47> pingec i've heard that jquery works fine with XML
[09:19:33] <Jon47> haven't used it myself though
[09:19:58] <shoky> it doesn't
[09:20:01] <shoky> only with very simple xml
[09:20:19] <shoky> afaik
[09:26:39] <anew> i still dont get this, if i wanted to port this plugin i have to reassign where the errors show up
[09:28:34] <dagerik> What is the advatage to "importing" jquery in the module pattern opposed to just use the global $?
[09:29:35] <diamonds> will $(window).load wait 'til my GA script is loaded?
[09:30:09] <dagerik> diamonds: probably not. Will execute when DOM is loaded I think.
[09:30:20] <diamonds> ? http://stackoverflow.com/a/1012156/146406
[09:30:21] <bot-t> diamonds, Couldn't find "http://stackoverflow.com/a/1012156/146406" in jQuery Docs.
[09:30:33] <diamonds> ? load
[09:30:33] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[09:31:01] <diamonds> "The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been completely loaded. "
[09:31:11] <diamonds> this SHOULD wait 'til GA is loaded
[09:32:16] <_ramok> hi
[09:33:05] <sssilver> So here http://bpaste.net/show/TTH0VmhM1yMaEm82fnT0/ somewhere in line 18-20, I get an error: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier".... what could possibly be causing it, if all my variable appear to have values at that point?
[09:33:44] <phidah> I have a basic plugin (some code omitted), that runs on all the elements matched by $.fn.powerlay - http://jsfiddle.net/kDayy/
[09:34:11] <phidah> Lets say I'd like to call the show method on the objects created for a specific elementâ€¦ how'd I do that?
[09:34:35] <_ramok> i'm loading a html snippet that includes some javascript via ajax into another site. this javascript has a document ready listener, that is doing some operations.  this javascript operations are not executed if i load this snippet
[09:34:41] <_ramok> can i force this somehow?
[09:40:44] <anew> shoky
[09:41:20] <anew> sacho
[09:43:31] <shoky> anew
[09:43:57] <anew> i see on line 640 of jquery.validate creates where the message will be displayed here http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/   but i still dont get how if i wanted to port this app what needs to happen
[09:44:21] <shoky> what's the question?
[09:44:59] <shoky> have you even read the plugin's documentation?
[09:45:02] <anew> shoky question is... if i need to port this i cant figure out what needs to be modified... he is creating where to place with line 640 but i just dont understand
[09:45:04] <anew> yes
[09:45:14] <shoky> port it to what?
[09:45:29] <shoky> "i just dont understand" wont get you anywhere..
[09:45:35] <anew> well documentation here is in german xd
[09:45:39] <anew> XD
[09:45:49] <shoky> is it
[09:45:57] <the_jeebster> hi guys. any suggestions for jquery carousel plugins?
[09:46:26] <anew> ok well this page for example, u type in a short password and hit next the error message comes up... great, so i step thru the code and set a breakpoint on line 3 of mktsigup.js .... but how can i move this code around sites tho what needs to be modified i dont get it
[09:46:41] <anew> *line 4
[09:46:52] <shoky> "move this code around sites"? what are you talking about
[09:46:53] <anew> *bp on line 4
[09:47:06] <shoky> if you want to use the plugin, follow the documentation :\
[09:47:08] <anew> i.e. use this plugin somewhere else
[09:47:32] <shoky> if you dont understand something specific, ask. but general questions will, at best, get you general answers
[09:48:03] <anew> yes i read it, no good, so i'm just trying to debug it to understand... hmmm ok let me think of a more specific question
[09:50:05] <shoky> making a jsfiddle of what you've tried so far is best
[09:50:08] <anew> shoky specifically if i changed the id and class to the password field i cant find where to edit the plugin to correspond
[09:50:18] <shoky> edit the plugin?
[09:50:22] <shoky> why would you edit the plugin?
[09:50:38] <shoky> what's the problem with changing id and class of the field?
[09:52:02] <shoky> (of course, you need to keep the class that has to do with the validation plugin, e.g. 'required' or 'password' )
[09:53:27] <superjoe> hey jquery ui team - I have a project that has received some complements about the UI and how pretty it is, and all I did is use jquery ui
[09:53:28] <DarKnight2012> scrollTop() can set the scrollbar at a specific position.
[09:53:40] <DarKnight2012> Is there anyway to set scrollbar at the bottom without having to hardcode the position in scrollTop()?
[09:53:42] <DarKnight2012> any suggestion please?
[09:53:47] <superjoe> I'm wondering if you guys might want to feature it as a demo on jqueryui.com?
[09:54:18] <Whirl3d> DarKnight2012, you could always use the tried and true ScrollTo plugin
[09:55:48] <DarKnight2012> Whirl3d: thanks. I'll try it nw
[10:00:06] <anew> shoky i guess i can change id and class of field, but where are these rules stated, that's what i cant find?
[10:00:50] <DarKnight2012> Whirl3d: just wonder why scrollTop($('#someid').height()) does not work?
[10:01:21] <DarKnight2012> it ends up with the scrollbar in the middle instead of the end of element
[10:02:50] <shoky> anew: what rules?
[10:03:17] <anew> shoky i mean where in the plugin does it state what the id and class field should be?
[10:03:29] <shoky> anew: it doesn't
[10:03:37] <Whirl3d> the ScrollTop value is the height of the content outside of the viewable area.  That being said, you might need to set scrollTop to $('elem').height()-$(portal).height()....where portal is the viewable portion
[10:03:38] <shoky> anew: it doesnt care about the id of the element..
[10:03:40] <anew> ok this is exactly where i'm confused
[10:03:58] <shoky> anew: it just cares about inputs that have classes like "required" or "password"
[10:04:10] <shoky> anew: according to the validation "methods" that are in the docs..
[10:04:14] <anew> ok so where are the classes if i want to change the names of the classes
[10:04:25] <shoky> anew: or custom methods that you can add yourself to the plugin, like that page does with "password"
[10:04:49] <shoky> anew: you mean you want to change "required" to some other string?
[10:04:55] <anew>  i dont see class required or class plugin or class form anywhere
[10:04:59] <anew> yes exactly
[10:05:13] <anew> i want to see where the plugin calls class required
[10:05:34] <shoky> you don't call a class
[10:05:53] <anew> wrong word
[10:06:03] <sebastian_o|> guys guys, there is something to do growl kind of notifications but that works outside the browser? (real growls?)
[10:06:05] <shoky> the plugin code has lots of references to "required"
[10:06:25] <shoky> anew: look at line 901 of validate.js
[10:06:35] <shoky> anew: that's where the "required" method is defined...
[10:07:12] <anew> so <td class="field'>  inside the plugin is controlled with $("form").validate ?
[10:07:24] <shoky> what?
[10:07:37] <DarKnight2012> Whirl3d: thanks
[10:08:01] <anew> lol i know i make zero sense lol
[10:08:10] <shoky> 0.1% maybe ;]
[10:08:17] <anew> rofl
[10:08:17] <tw2113> 0.05
[10:08:22] <shoky> ;p
[10:08:33] <anew> rofl
[10:08:52] <anew> ok so if u hit next, u get the error You missed 12 fields. They have been highlighted below. at the top
[10:09:09] <JosefB> hey all
[10:09:11] <anew> this is class='field' correct ?
[10:09:35] <JosefB> got a weird problem with .ajax post
[10:09:41] <anew> sorry that's wrong...div class = 'error'
[10:09:42] <anew> is what it is
[10:09:56] <shoky> "this" ?
[10:10:00] <shoky> "it" ?
[10:10:22] <JosefB> wokrs for next nad previous (i.e. 1 | 2 | 3 | 4) but when I hit the next for the 3rd page it's remembering page 2
[10:10:28] <anew> ok try hitting next on the form... u get the error message on the top
[10:10:43] <anew> this is shown by line 29 in mktsignup.js
[10:10:44] <shoky> i dont think the class="field" has anything to do with the validation...
[10:10:45] <anew> correct
[10:10:46] <shoky> it's just css
[10:10:59] <shoky> and you don't validate a <td> :)
[10:11:12] <anew> ok... so we have $("form").validate that controls that correct then ?
[10:11:28] <shoky> sigh.
[10:11:35] <anew> roflll
[10:11:36] <shoky> "that controls that"
[10:11:42] <anew> i feel so stupid... can we do this in private chat
[10:11:42] <shoky> right.......
[10:11:42] <anew> lol
[10:12:03] <shoky> it's fun here i think.
[10:12:15] <shoky> why don't you make a SIMPLE SIMPLE website
[10:12:20] <JosefB> if you use ajax post for more then one request do you need to "clear" post data first?
[10:12:22] <anew> fine in here...
[10:12:23] <shoky> use the validation plugin on ONE simple field
[10:12:39] <shoky> until you get it right and figure out what's affecting what
[10:12:47] <shoky> then add some more shit. go step by step
[10:12:53] <shoky> don't try to debug some page you know nothing about
[10:12:53] <anew> but if u use the validation plugin on one field how does it know where to put the error message??? cant it put it anywhere on the page unless you tell it where to appear ? (css) ??
[10:14:06] <shoky> i donno, there are probably defaults for where it shows the message, and i'm sure you can configure it to stray from the defaults
[10:14:08] <anew> how does the error message go above the field and not below for example
[10:14:12] <shoky> virtually every plugin works that way
[10:14:18] <anew> yes, exactly... that's what i'm trying to find !!
[10:14:22] <anew> i cant find it
[10:14:27] <anew> please i want to die
[10:14:42] <shoky> dont try to find it based on some random page with lots of fields
[10:14:45] <shoky> keep it SIMPLE
[10:14:52] <shoky> that's the only way to really learn
[10:14:54] <shoky> and progres
[10:14:55] <shoky> s
[10:15:04] <anew> yes but i will go crazy if i cant find this.... then i will keep it simple
[10:15:09] <shoky> ;]
[10:15:15] <anew> i feel like i have not accomplished anything
[10:15:29] <shoky> you're going against what your advisors tell you
[10:15:39] <anew> lol please....
[10:16:01] <anew> i just need to see the defaults of where to show the message
[10:16:12] <anew> then i am on the path of the advisors
[10:16:23] <sebastian_o|> no real growls from jquery then?
[10:16:58] <shoky> anew: mktSignup.js , line 33
[10:17:02] <catcher> anew, looks like error messages will show in <label for="fieldID" class="error"> if they exist.
[10:17:18] <shoky> $("div.error span").html(message);
[10:17:19] <shoky> ^^
[10:18:06] <anew> $("div.error span").html(message); makes it appear in fieldID and error ?
[10:18:08] <anew> interesting
[10:18:12] <shoky> what no
[10:18:19] <shoky> it makes it appear in div.error span
[10:18:40] <shoky> in this page they supply an 'invalidHandler' to the plugin
[10:18:44] <anew> yes but then where is div.error span defined as fieldID and error ?
[10:19:05] <shoky> what is fieldId and error ?
[10:19:13] <anew> <label for="fieldID" class="error">
[10:19:14] <bloof> lol
[10:19:18] <shoky> what about it?
[10:19:22] <bloof> circles
[10:19:25] <anew> rofl
[10:19:31] <anew> that's where the error message appears
[10:19:34] <shoky> no its not
[10:19:43] <anew> wat that's what u just said
[10:19:47] <shoky> did i.
[10:20:16] <anew> oh catcher said that
[10:20:22] <anew> i thought u said that
[10:20:26] <shoky> anew: he was talking about the messages that appear next to the fields
[10:20:29] <anew> yes
[10:20:34] <shoky> but right now we were discussing the message that appears on top
[10:20:35] <shoky> different things.
[10:21:39] <anew> so message appears here <label for="fieldID" class="error"> great... and $("form").validate() displays the message... how does $("form").validate display the message <label for="fieldID" class="error"> here then
[10:21:53] <shoky> that's done inside the plugin code
[10:21:56] <anew> all i see is show and hide
[10:22:26] <shoky> and we already found where that is done:
[10:22:26] <shoky> [19:15:30] <shoky> anew: line 640 in jquery.validate.js
[10:22:27] <shoky> [19:15:48] <shoky> label.html(message);   is setting the actual error text
[10:22:40] <JosefB> Hey anyone ever seen a problem with ajax post where it's sending previous post values?
[10:23:06] <anew> line 640 doesnt say anything about class="error" tho
[10:23:15] <shoky> IT DOESNT ALL HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME LINE
[10:23:25] <anew> yes but the whole function there
[10:23:28] <shoky> jeez. lay off this page already
[10:23:30] <anew> i dont see any references
[10:23:31] <shoky> start simple
[10:23:40] <shoky> i'm through trying to get through to you ;]
[10:23:43] <anew> bleh
[10:23:44] <anew> ok
[10:23:46] <anew> thanks tho
[10:23:49] <shoky> np
[10:24:18] <Murg|e> @shoky, you pointed out yesterday the .siblings() to toggle the display of a single div area. I'm trying to now execute a single save button. I tried using siblings again to specify the exact form but no go. Any suggestions again? http://jsfiddle.net/n9vaD/8/
[10:25:52] <shoky> Murg|e: not sure what the issue is
[10:26:08] <shoky> Murg|e: i only see one call to siblings, not related to the save button
[10:26:25] <Murg|e> shoky, I had the form working to ajax submit. But it would only work for the first save button in the CC item.
[10:27:03] <shoky> donno what you mean.. i dont understand what your question is
[10:28:06] <Murg|e> shoky, umm, so there are 6 forms on that page with 6 submit buttons generated dynamically. How do I identify which form is being submitted to send to ajax.
[10:28:37] <keirlav87> is there a way to remove the inverted commas from around an object property?
[10:28:47] <Murg|e> I could give all the forms dynamic ID's which should do it. But I still don't know how to get the id the specific form.
[10:29:07] <Murg|e> I was trying .closest() as well but couldnt get it to work.
[10:30:29] <shoky> Murg|e: you mean this? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/n9vaD/9/
[10:31:14] <shoky> oops
[10:31:44] <shoky> i meant: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/n9vaD/10/
[10:32:46] <Murg|e> So just identifying by class instead of ID should do it?
[10:32:52] <Murg|e> Let me give that a shot.
[10:33:07] <shoky> i also changed it from being a click handler on a button, to being a submit handler on a form
[10:33:18] <shoky> wait, the forms themselves are added dynamically too?
[10:33:22] <Murg|e> Yes.
[10:33:29] <Murg|e> Everything is dynamic on that page.
[10:34:27] <shoky> ah no they are not dynamic
[10:34:40] <shoky> and neither are the buttons
[10:34:43] <shoky> (at least in your fiddle..)
[10:36:03] <GreekFreak> hi all.
[10:36:13] <Murg|e> I meant dynamic in the sense, php just loops through and creates all the dolumns, line items, and forms.
[10:36:26] <shoky> ok, that's not dynamic from the browser's point of view
[10:36:32] <GreekFreak> I'm trying to get a Modal form to open on the same page, and I can't seem to get it right. Could someome please take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/tscholiadis/uFS3F/
[10:36:34] <shoky> static html
[10:36:53] <shoky> Murg|e: also, add the parameter to the submit handler  (e)
[10:37:00] <shoky> for the e.preventDefault() to work
[10:38:09] <Murg|e> Ok thats working. Such simple solutions. Thanks again.
[10:38:20] <shoky> np
[10:38:22] <Murg|e> While I have you, could you point me at what I'd be looking for to refresh that div on the save.
[10:39:30] <shoky> refresh?
[10:40:28] <Murg|e> I'll do some googling lol. But when I save the content, the input doesnt close and present the new value.  I actually have to reload the paeg to see the new values.
[10:40:30] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know why the toggle jolts, and how I can keep the first tier links always on top with absolute positioning?
[10:40:32] <jeffreylevesque> http://jsfiddle.net/5fNbh/183/
[10:40:35] <JosefB> how do I clear the pot values in from the .ajax post method?
[10:40:41] <jeffreylevesque> *without
[10:40:46] <JosefB> values are being cached from previous request
[10:41:10] <shoky> GreekFreak: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/uFS3F/1/
[10:41:34] <shoky> GreekFreak: you didnt include jquery ui and its CSS. and you didn't have an id on the <a>
[10:42:56] <shoky> Murg|e: you can do whatever you want in the ajax success callback ..
[10:45:42] <newbiee> what does document.activeElement return? i want it to check if input is the active element or not
[10:45:47] <newbiee> to use in if condition
[10:47:24] <Wizywig> hey guys, anyone seen a problem in IE when jquery 1.7 support is being checked, it gives "command not supported" error? It tries to set the input's type to "radio" before it is inserted into the dom, but that just fails (jquery source)
[10:47:41] <Wizywig> i been googling and cant seem to find this problem anywhere
[10:47:56] <Wizywig> ie7/8 won't run my pages because of it
[10:48:34] <cohitre> ? :focus @ newbiee

[11:11:09] <al_2000> hi
[11:11:43] <sacho> GreekFreak, buttons don't have focus or blur
[11:11:48] <sacho> ..I don't think
[11:12:04] <sacho> ah, they do, but it's not invoked by clicking or anything.
[11:12:11] <sacho> It's if you select them through tab-select, for example
[11:12:20] <xboi209>  someprimetime: you here?
[11:12:28] <someprimetime> xboi209: yo
[11:12:36] <xboi209> I wanted to use both arrays
[11:12:38] <someprimetime> i don't even know if that's possible to do with the same array name?
[11:12:38] <sacho> GreekFreak, at any rate, it works fine - just not when you expect it to
[11:12:49] <someprimetime> because you're overwriting it, right?
[11:12:53] <xboi209> but i've been thinking about it
[11:12:54] <xboi209> what if
[11:13:11] <GreekFreak> sacho, I want it to slideUp with the modal window is open. I updated the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/tscholiadis/rurY5/3/
[11:13:29] <xboi209> I use an increment operator ++ at the end of each name AND when i call the array
[11:13:33] <xboi209> wouldn't that work?
[11:14:38] <sacho> GreekFreak, then add the sldeUp to the click event that opens the modal window
[11:14:42] <sacho> and get rid of all those crazy returns
[11:15:50] <sacho> GreekFreak, http://jsfiddle.net/rurY5/5/
[11:15:56] <GreekFreak> sacho, I was just about to say, I moved it to the click. take a look http://jsfiddle.net/tscholiadis/rurY5/4/
[11:16:03] <xboi209>  someprimetime: any ideas now?
[11:16:36] <GreekFreak> sacho, as for the returns, they're being put there by CoffeeScript, not me

[11:18:17] <sacho> what element
[11:18:23] <sacho> test case, etc
[11:18:30] <xboi209>  sacho: But it doesn't return the values of both arrays
[11:18:59] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/QQsCx/5/
[11:19:00] <tesmar> hi sacho it is an input: <input class="tiny_input" id="apt_recall_units" maxlength="2" name="apt_recall[units]" size="1" type="text" value="9">
[11:19:09] <sacho> also, it sounds like you need a js primer. :|
[11:20:26] <xboi209>  sacho: That returns all the values in the array, I just need foo[0]
[11:20:52] <tesmar> sacho: http://jsfiddle.net/QQsCx/5/
[11:21:03] <tesmar> it works on jsFiddle but not in my app
[11:21:04] <tesmar> hmm
[11:21:53] <sacho> you have a really poor way of expressing what you want
[11:21:59] <xboi209> o.O
[11:22:32] <xboi209> ok I just want foo[0] from both of the arrays

[11:42:58] <Hornet> suggestions for best pattern to use for fading an image out, changing src attr, then fading back in again?
[11:43:00] <newbiee> $('div#currentitemEdit').closest('div.itemDiv span.item_label').click();
[11:43:07] <newbiee> i tried this did not fire the event
[11:43:08] <Hornet> image may or may not already be loaded, so onload is out
[11:45:09] <Hornet> $('div#mainslide img').fadeOut(500, function() {
[11:45:10] <Hornet> 	$('div#mainslide img').attr('src','carousel_img/1/'+itemid+'.jpg').fadeIn(500);

[11:45:26] <Hornet> that gives fade out, fade in, flick image swap
[11:45:43] <Hornet> seperating the commands has the same result
[11:46:21] <Hornet> not sure of the best method to use when load may or may not fire
[11:46:34] <Hornet> maybe load and a timeout(), one cancelling the other?
[11:46:43] <Hornet> race condition I suppose :\
[11:46:55] <Hornet> opinions please
[11:47:07] <sacho> newbiee, are the two divs actually siblings
[11:47:15] <sacho> are they both in the same container
[11:47:38] <newbiee> i don't think so..they are both inside different <li> container
[11:47:52] <sacho> then it won't match them
[11:47:58] <Brodingo> Hornet https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[11:48:00] <Hornet> so go up to a common parent, then down via find or similar
[11:48:06] <Brodingo> worth a look
[11:48:40] <Hornet> ah nice, thanks
[11:49:02] <sacho> newbiee, var $items = $('.item_edit');. var $next = $items.filter(function(i) { if (i == 0) return false; return $(items).eq(i - 1).is('#currentitemEdit'); }); <- is what I was typing out when you asked your question
[11:49:40] <newbiee> what will the above code do  sacho?
[11:49:42] <JosefB> Quick Question
[11:49:50] <sacho> nevermind! there's an easier solution
[11:49:54] <JosefB> How do you chain together commands onthe ajax call back function?
[11:51:16] <newbiee> sacho was your last msg meant for me?
[11:51:39] <sacho> yes
[11:51:52] <JosefB> ok got it -- my eval statement isn't working
[11:51:55] <newbiee> what did you mean by easier solution
[11:51:56] <newbiee> ?
[11:52:54] <Hornet> Brodingo, that has the same problem
[11:53:14] <sacho> var $items = $('.item_edit'); var index = $('.item_edit').index($('#currentitemEdit')); var $next = $items.eq(index);
[11:53:17] <Hornet> no idea how but it does
[11:53:24] <sacho> oops
[11:53:30] <sacho> var $next = $items.eq(index + 1)
[11:54:00] <sacho> newbiee that would get you the div with class item_edit that is after the one with the id #currentitemEdit
[11:54:23] <sacho> the one with the id, rather
[11:54:45] <datarecall> i have 3 buttons and 3 divs when each button is clicked each button will hide the other 2 divs and .show 1, is there an easier way to do this rather then .hide() the other 2 each time the button is clicked ?
[11:54:45] <fission6>  want to programmitally do the equivlent of toggling off the style using firebug but need that in my code is there a way to do this using jquery
[11:54:51] <newbiee> ok i will try
[11:55:46] <newbiee> but if you had noticed in my first line i had div and span inside $ and then click...would the above also compensate for the span or i would have to think of something else
[11:56:20] <sacho> I'm not sure what you mean
[11:56:54] <sacho> once you've found the "next" div, $next
[11:57:07] <sacho> if you wanted to click something inside it... $next.find('span blah blah').click()
[11:58:26] <newbiee> you have been of great help i wanted to emulate this function $(".itemDiv span.item_label).click()  where .itemDiv is the class of the div i was talking about
[12:00:59] <al_2000> How would I change the z-index of my jquery dropdown menu? It drops down from the navbar, but hides behind the pages content
[12:01:07] <al_2000> $( "#search" ).autocomplete({ source: availableTags });
[12:01:34] <al_2000> I tried putting $( "#search" ).css('z-index',3999); after it
[12:02:18] <NoiseEee> zIndex
[12:03:11] <al_2000> ?
[12:03:13] <al_2000> what about it
[12:03:37] <johnkpaul> al_2000: camelcase, not dased
[12:03:39] <johnkpaul> dashed*
[12:05:22] <newbiee> var $items = $('.item_edit');
[12:05:23] <newbiee> var index = $('.item_edit').index($('#currentitemEdit'));
[12:05:23] <newbiee> var $next = $items.eq(index +1);
[12:05:23] <newbiee> $($next).click();
[12:05:33] <newbiee> i messed up the last line
[12:06:38] <teewuane> newbiee: ^
[12:06:39] <teewuane> hehe
[12:06:46] <al_2000> so i would do $("#search").css("zIndex","99999"); ?
[12:06:50] <al_2000> not z-index?
[12:07:37] <newbiee> teewuane could you point out my mistake rather than laugh about it
[12:08:35] <al_2000> Do i need to apply the z-index to somethig other than the input? Is there a name for the dropdown when using jquery UI?
[12:09:15] <teewuane> newbiee: my bad i though someone was helping you already :) i just saw "newbie > i messed up the last line" hehe
[12:09:36] <newbiee> i meant the click event did not occur
[12:09:40] <teewuane> but i think you need to do just $next.click(function(){});
[12:10:21] <newbiee> doing that did not work
[12:10:37] <teewuane> newbiee: i usually don't create jquery variables with the '$' in front of them, for some reason it always throws me off, but i guess if it is a jquery object it makes sense.
[12:12:00] <teewuane> newbiee: what do you get when you console.log($next);
[12:12:20] <newbiee> [object object]
[12:12:32] <newbiee> i did alert on $next
[12:12:51] <teewuane> do console.log, it will show you what it is actually referring to
[12:13:08] <teewuane> what browser are you using?
[12:13:33] <newbiee> mozilla
[12:13:45] <newbiee> i type console.log into the function where can i see its output
[12:15:23] <teewuane> newbiee: you will need to install FireBug if you do not already have it. I don't think firefox comes with a default web inspector-like tool
[12:15:30] <newbiee> i have firebu
[12:15:32] <newbiee> firebug
[12:16:59] <tesmar> teewuane: do you have any idea why query .val(new_val) would change the underlying val but not update the DOM?
[12:17:48] <teewuane> newbiee: right click anywhere on the page, choose "inspect element with firebug", that will come up, choose the "Console" tab, reload your page.
[12:17:56] <teewuane> your console.log will show up there
[12:18:30] <teewuane> tesmar: is it a form input you are trying to update?
[12:18:37] <tesmar> teewuane: yes
[12:18:48] <newbiee> nothing showd up in consoe.log
[12:19:15] <converge> dudes, I have this page http://paste2.org/p/2060825 , and it loads a lot of heavy images, it takes like 1min to open the narrows to navigate, I need to improve it's performance. Does someones know how can I improve it ?
[12:19:33] <teewuane> tesmar: what kind?
[12:19:38] <newbiee> i wrote console.log on keydown
[12:19:40] <newbiee> function
[12:19:55] <tesmar> teewuane: http://jsfiddle.net/QQsCx/5/
[12:19:59] <tesmar> generic input box
[12:20:07] <tesmar> text
[12:20:17] <jonathancutrell> converge: Don't load heavy images. :)
[12:20:38] <jonathancutrell> converge: Or, compress them. Or load them after the page loads and inject them if you want the page to load a bit quicker.
[12:21:07] <teewuane> tesmar: is that correct link? has no vals or inputs on it
[12:21:23] <converge> jonathancutrell: I'll try this plugin lazyLoad, but Idk if I'll be able to do that here http://www.fortunata.com.br/catalogo/
[12:21:45] <newbiee> the console.log gave me[div.item_edit]
[12:22:40] <teewuane> newbiee: is that what it is supposed to be? right now you are saying when you click on the div with a class of 'item_edit' , do that function
[12:22:59] <tesmar> teewuane: http://jsfiddle.net/QQsCx/5/
[12:23:12] <tesmar> http://jsfiddle.net/QQsCx/10/
[12:23:13] <tesmar> oops
[12:23:30] <newbiee> yes i was trying to emulate the event that i had mentioned above
[12:23:31] <jonathancutrell> converge: You could also offload them to a CDN.
[12:23:48] <newbiee> that event would be on keydown so i needed the div
[12:23:48] <teewuane> newbiee: ah, so you want to emulate a click?
[12:23:53] <converge> jonathancutrell: CDN ?
[12:24:00] <newbiee> yes for that div
[12:24:09] <jonathancutrell> converge: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network
[12:24:12] <jedahan> http://jsfiddle.net/jysNF/7/ << how come the click is not registered here?
[12:24:20] <tesmar> teewuane: it works in jsfiddle but not in my app
[12:24:22] <tesmar> so frustrating
[12:25:23] <teewuane> newbiee: how do you know it is not getting triggered? what is supposed to happen when that element is clicked? do you have a function that fires off?
[12:25:48] <teewuane> tesmar: i still don't think i have the right link to your jsfiddle.
[12:25:52] <newbiee> it will change the style of the div that has the click event
[12:25:57] <tesmar> hmm
[12:26:08] <tesmar> teewuane: http://jsfiddle.net/QQsCx/10/
[12:26:11] <tesmar> that works for me
[12:26:11] <newbiee> it will fire a function for that purpose
[12:26:24] <teewuane> it's giving me something about "I want this to use both arrays"
[12:26:27] <teewuane> tesmar: ^
[12:26:55] <teewuane> newbiee: can you paste your code in a jsfiddle or pastie.org ?
[12:28:01] <tesmar> teewuane: sorry bout that, but is there spacial consideration when setting vals for input elements?
[12:28:16] <newbiee> http://pastie.org/4156058
[12:28:41] <newbiee> i am trying to emulate the click event of line 212 into the function at line 145
[12:28:56] <teewuane> tesmar: i would do... var abc = "foobar"; $("#theinput").val(foobar);
[12:29:09] <Lost123> hi
[12:29:31] <Lost123> i have a slideshow which has li s with images
[12:29:39] <Lost123> everytime i load the page, i get differnt number or lis
[12:30:03] <Lost123> is that because, if image is not loaded li will not be created?
[12:30:36] <teewuane> newbiee: $(".itemDiv span.item_label").click(function(){itemDivfn();});
[12:31:16] <newbiee> the .itemDiv would be the div after the div with id currentitemEdit
[12:31:40] <newbiee> so somehow incorporate $next to emulate this line
[12:32:06] <newbiee> ?
[12:32:43] <doug_> are there any carousel plugins that don't suck?
[12:32:47] <doug_> also, why am i not me?
[12:33:03] <teewuane> doug_: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[12:33:09] <Lost123> anyone?
[12:33:29] <teewuane> newbiee: $next.click(function(){somefunction();});
[12:33:39] <teewuane> newbiee: if i'm following right...
[12:33:41] <jedahan> doug_ ender-carousel? it has a jquery plugin...
[12:34:09] <jedahan> i've been using it with an in-gallery interactive here
[12:34:11] <doug> hm, cycle plugin?
[12:34:12] <newbiee> i don't need to put anyting after click as you might have noticed in earlier lines
[12:34:45] <teewuane> newbiee: true, i just find it easier to debug
[12:34:54] <newbiee> like for some keypress doing just $(".saveme").click() would work without putting the function
[12:36:02] <teewuane> newbiee: $next.click(); will simulate a click on what ever $next is, then if you have a function listening for that event... like $(".something").click(dosomething);
[12:36:04] <christo_m> does anyone know why id be getting "body is undefined (2278 out of range 4)" errors?
[12:37:00] <Lost123> why would my slideshow have different number of images each time?
[12:37:18] <Lost123> is it because it will load as much images as were loaded completely?
[12:37:24] <doug> hm, not sure i want to go with ender...
[12:38:29] <Es0teric> who has used the lastfm api here?
[12:38:59] <teewuane> newbiee: wish i could be more helpful, without fully understanding what it is you are trying to do, it's kind of hard :)
[12:39:11] <newbiee> i know
[12:39:23] <newbiee> i have tried to explain evertying i know
[12:42:39] <newbiee> can i show with screenshot?
[12:42:40] <christo_m> has anyone ever gotten this JS error?
[12:42:43] <newbiee> to explain
[12:42:45] <jedahan> teewuane, click() doesn't work if your mouse button is already held down :(
[12:43:09] <jedahan> at least not with http://jsfiddle.net/jysNF/7/
[12:43:12] <teewuane> newbiee: sure
[12:43:33] <teewuane> jedahan: interesting.. didn't know that
[12:43:50] <newbiee> whats the link to paste screenshot
[12:45:17] <teewuane> newbiee: i don't know if there is a standard where all images should be uploaded to but http://imgur.com/ works great

[12:46:03] <gdoron> Hi, I have a DOM node is there a way to know if it's inside of an <iframe> or not?
[12:46:16] <newbiee> so what i am trying to do is when user presses ctrl+uparrow then the item above the input box i.e terst ses shoule be editable like task2g
[12:46:26] <newbiee> and the click event that i was talking about does that task
[12:47:54] <gdoron> Hi, I have a DOM node is there a way to know if it's inside of an <iframe> or not? is there a way?
[12:49:34] <Gho5t> $('#dom-node').closest('iframe').length > 0
[12:50:01] <newbiee> any solutions to my problem
[12:50:12] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/n9vaD/14/ Could someone take a look at the first js function.  I'm trying to get the div thats saved to update with the new results on success.
[12:51:11] <gdoron> Thanks Gho5t, I'll try it, though I think it won't work.
[12:51:17] <gdoron> (with iframe)
[12:51:17] <teewuane> newbiee: i'm wondering if instead of emulating a click, you just directly target the function, is there a particular reason why you are using the click? like, why not just call the function directly on that event? .. make sense?
[12:52:13] <newbiee> i thought of that but then i could not understand how to manipulate the this
[12:52:47] <newbiee> you mean the itemdivfn function
[12:52:58] <datarecall> if i want to scroll the window to a particular div id whats the best way to do that
[12:53:04] <teewuane> newbiee: yes, because that is called when you click on one of those elements, right?
[12:53:10] <newbiee> right
[12:53:40] <teewuane> so when someone pushes ctrl + up arrow, call itemdivfn.
[12:53:51] <newbiee> i have two criterias when ctrl+uparrow edit the item above the input and when ctrl+down arrow edit the item below it
[12:55:34] <teewuane> newbiee: ah,
[12:55:55] <newbiee> bit complex isn't it
[12:58:26] <khinester> hello, on the themeroller http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ accordion, when you select a section, it 'lifts' the all the other divs bellow it
[12:58:36] <newbiee> so any idea teewuane
[12:59:05] <teewuane> newbiee: so, ctrl+upArrow, take item that is active, find the one above it, simulate a click on it.  .. WhenThisHappens(function(){$(this}.prev('.fooItem').click();        ?
[12:59:07] <stongo> what's the best way to prevent multiple popups on a hover event? I have an image gallery that does an ajax call on a thumbnail mouseover, and pop ups a little box with the data, and then hides the box on mouseout. the problem is if the ajax call takes too long and they end up mousing over somewhere else, the first one hangs there until they mouseout the second thumbnail they are on.
[12:59:24] <teewuane> *$(this)
[12:59:29] <troydm> hey guys, have any1 had any problems that when changing the inside of div using $('id').html method the actual element didn't redraw itself on IE ?
[12:59:45] <stongo> I'm using the hoverIntent jquery plugin to set a timeout on the hover, but it still happens
[12:59:58] <teewuane> newbiee: how are you capturing the ctrl+uparrow event?
[13:00:14] <newbiee> using e.which == 38 and isctrl
[13:00:20] <newbiee> where isctrl is set to true
[13:00:30] <newbiee> i don't know what to do after that
[13:00:48] <newbiee> if i could just do for up arrow i can manage for down
[13:04:31] <teewuane> newbiee: one sec
[13:10:10] <lacrymology> is there a way to find out where a method is defined from a console?
[13:10:36] <Es0teric> lacrymology i would just do console.log(obj.method);
[13:10:49] <Es0teric> **** console.log(obj.method());
[13:12:16] <faryshta> How do I get the number of childs of an element?
[13:13:14] <lacrymology> Es0teric: that doesn't say where it's defined
[13:13:18] <jehe> I have issue with my drop-down meny. http://jsfiddle.net/FnEtH/ On fadeOut as you can see on menu CSS & JavaScript the list moves to the far left. I think this is related to my jQuery code somehow. Thanks
[13:13:44] <jehe> hover: fadeOut on meny
[13:14:20] <mprentice> happy tuesday folks
[13:15:10] <newbiee> hope to catchup with the solution tomorrow
[13:15:15] <newbiee> got to go to sleep
[13:15:16] <someprimetime> everybody's WORK FOR THE WEEKEND
[13:15:21] <someprimetime> workin
[13:15:26] <teewuane> newbiee: pasting right now
[13:15:39] <teewuane> newbiee: http://pastie.org/4156275
[13:15:53] <teewuane> that is working on a mac keyboard.
[13:16:11] <MysterOnyx> I'm using jquery UI's drag drop. My draggable moves on top of certain divs and behind others. What distinguishes which divs the draggables will go in front of and behind?
[13:16:23] <newbiee> the $next.click does not give the desired effect that i want
[13:17:59] <someprimetime> MysterOnyx: the z-index of the object being dragged?
[13:18:00] <newbiee> now i need the click event to fire on the div that is immediately above it
[13:18:20] <MysterOnyx> someprimetime perhaps.. I didn't set a different z-index for any of my elements, though
[13:18:42] <newbiee> <div class="itemDiv><span></span><span></span><div class="item_edit">
[13:18:43] <someprimetime> MysterOnyx: hm i'd just always give the draggable container like one of 1000
[13:19:17] <MysterOnyx> someprimetime ok
[13:28:48] <newbiee> $next.prev().prev() if i add one more .prev() it does not give me anything
[13:29:22] <newbiee> <div><span></span><span></span><div> $next is the last div
[13:32:40] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to find an object by class name that's nearest to the current object, but not necessarily an ancestor? there may be multiple items found, but it should find the one with the least ancestors between it and the source object first.....
[13:32:59] <ryanneufeld> ?closest
[13:32:59] <caniuse> ryanneufeld: .closest(): Gets an array of all the elements and selectors matched against the current element up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:33:15] <ryanneufeld> ?closest @ tomasm-
[13:33:15] <caniuse> tomasm-: .closest(): Gets an array of all the elements and selectors matched against the current element up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:33:31] <tomasm-> ryanneufeld, that would work except it's not an ancestor, so it doesn't match
[13:34:05] <ryanneufeld> tomasm-: closest takes a selector
[13:36:10] <tomasm-> ryanneufeld, it's still not matching - they share a common ancestor, but j('#LinkItems').closest('.flashMessages') returns empty.... where it looks something like <div> <div class="flashMessages">...</div> <div> <span id="FileItems"></span> </div> </div>
[13:36:40] <ryanneufeld> have you tried .find() ?
[13:37:39] <MysterOnyx> with jquery UI, when I drop a draggable, how can I access properties of the draggable? if I do $(this), it's referring to the droppable, but I want to access the draggable's properties.
[13:37:52] <tomasm-> problem is that there are multiple elements returned, and I need the one nearest in the dom to the source item.... find starts with the first found item from the beginning of the document
[13:39:04] <tomasm-> hmmm, i may be able to simplifying it somewhat....
[13:39:38] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: ui.draggable
[13:39:53] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#event-drop
[13:40:47] <scar> is there a nice way to have a textbox auto-populate answers?
[13:41:01] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul thanks I just saw that
[13:41:17] <johnkpaul> no problem, MysterOnyx
[13:41:45] <scar> is the autocomplete plugin or whatever good?
[13:41:48] <scar> i heard bad thungs
[13:41:50] <scar> thigns
[13:42:09] <tomasm-> bad things?
[13:43:10] <scar> tomasm-: well, yeah i heard it was not _good_, but thats all i heard which means nothing. im guessing like if i have a database of 18,000 city names, having PHP generate the javascript code to pull each Item in var availableTags (per the example)--- how can i have it pull maybe from a text file or a database/
[13:44:23] <Es0teric> grabbing values from an input field is $("#inputid").val(); right?
[13:44:25] <davvblack> anyone know how to combine :nth-child and :eq?  I want to pick out odd TR's in a table that may have <script> tags mixed in between the trs
[13:45:00] <faryshta> How do I get the number of childs of an element?
[13:45:14] <jehe> I have issue with my drop-down meny. http://jsfiddle.net/FnEtH/ On fadeOut as you can see on menu CSS & JavaScript the list moves to the far left. I think this is related to my jQuery code somehow. The list moves to the far left when fading out
[13:45:55] <Dr-Bombay> davv: why not use grep
[13:46:03] <tomasm-> scar, you dont have php store it into a javascript variable in the html file - you have it query a db after a certain number of chars are entered. look that the 'remote datasource' example (you may need to google around more)
[13:46:16] <tomasm-> scar, the php should return a json response, i believe
[13:46:39] <davvblack> tomasm-, thanks, indeed, why not :)
[13:48:14] <Dr-Bombay> davv: that's not the right name. The function I was thinking of is .is()
[13:48:42] <Dr-Bombay> and don't call me shirley
[13:48:51] <davvblack> heh, oops
[13:48:56] <scar> tomasm-: ahh so i just make php script that exports JSON, easy :) thank ya sir!
[13:49:27] <AdonisSMU> Ok question how can I do variable variable evaluation without using the eval function
[13:49:29] <davvblack> i don't think is is it either
[13:49:32] <tomasm-> depends on what the definition of "is" is
[13:49:32] <davvblack> it returns a bool
[13:49:46] <davvblack> what is is isn't what I need.
[13:50:20] <AdonisSMU> one other question how can I get the key of an item in an array in jQuery
[13:50:37] <AdonisSMU> jQuery only returns the index and I want the key
[13:51:11] <johnkpaul> AdonisSMU: if you have an array, it is indexed by integers
[13:51:15] <johnkpaul> so the index is the key
[13:51:32] <AdonisSMU> yeah but my javascript array is an associative array
[13:51:42] <AdonisSMU> so it's more like an object
[13:51:44] <johnkpaul> AdonisSMU: those are different concepts in javascript
[13:51:57] <AdonisSMU> with array syntax
[13:52:15] <johnkpaul> objects can use array [] syntax, as well as dot notation
[13:52:32] <johnkpaul> jQuery doesn't have a way to generically search any object, just arrays AFAIK
[13:52:35] <johnkpaul> ?inArray @AdonisSMU
[13:52:59] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.inarray
[13:52:59] <caniuse> johnkpaul: jQuery.inArray(): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[13:54:25] <mzarella> is $.ajax.preventDefault( legal?
[13:54:39] <AdonisSMU> ahh ok not quite what I want...
[13:54:42] <davvblack> you have to preventDefault of a specific event
[13:54:47] <davvblack> so that makes no sesne mzarella
[13:55:00] <mzarella> i don't want the page to refresh
[13:55:02] <AdonisSMU> johnkpaul: So can I do it the object way maybe
[13:55:07] <mzarella> return false?
[13:55:18] <davvblack> page refresh isn't the default action of ajax
[13:55:21] <davvblack> what's causing it?
[13:55:24] <davvblack> posting a form?
[13:55:25] <johnkpaul> AdonisSMU: look into how underscore.js implements their searching
[13:55:37] <davvblack> in the event handler for submitting the form you'd have e.preventDefault()
[13:55:37] <mzarella> davvblack: it's a form
[13:55:48] <davvblack> yea, so catch the event that causes the form to post
[13:55:49] <LoneStar99> howdy i would think my issue is css, but do not find a fix for it, so may need jquery -->  need a div with or without content to always extend 0px from top to bottom --> http://jsfiddle.net/peduarte/RnKmE/1/
[13:56:01] <AdonisSMU> Ok I will take a look
[13:56:09] <AdonisSMU> thanks johnkpaul
[13:56:10] <mzarella> when the user clicks it, a jquery ajax request of dataType "json" is sent :)
[13:56:17] <johnkpaul> no problem AdonisSMU
[13:56:29] <scar> So, I can use a foo.php script to ECHO a JSON string and thats that?
[13:56:30] <davvblack> the click is the default you're trying to prevent
[13:56:31] <davvblack> not the ajax
[13:56:38] <mzarella> .live('click', function(event)...
[13:56:47] <davvblack> yea, in that funciton
[13:56:51] <davvblack> event.preventDefault()
[13:57:10] <RealityBall> what is a good way to make another event stop an automated event?
[13:58:38] <RealityBall> like for example windows.setInterval(2000, foo); or whatever and when I click on something I want to stop the function from running automatically
[13:58:42] <mzarella> .live('click', function(event)...).preventDefault() ?
[13:59:02] <RealityBall> oooo
[13:59:04] <RealityBall> interesting
[13:59:30] <mzarella> RealityBall: that was me asking a question earlier, not for you, sorry
[13:59:37] <RealityBall> oh okay
[13:59:38] <RealityBall> lol
[13:59:47] <scar> How many items will jQuery autocomplete support in a remote thing? lol
[14:00:25] <mzarella> davvblack: .live('click', function(event)...).preventDefault() ?
[14:00:31] <Zzaichik> Is there a way to grab all .prev() siblings?
[14:01:21] <Zzaichik> nevermind
[14:03:25] <davvblack> mzarella: â€¦. function(event){ event.preventDefault(); //other ajax stuff here. }
[14:03:38] <davvblack> the point being that you defent the default action of the click that submits the form
[14:03:50] <davvblack> aka stopping the submit button click from leaving the page like it normally would
[14:09:31] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. Is there any good way to manage this:   I have 5 "sections" in my site. Each section loads into a div by name. Some sections, lke the gallery section, require initialization to configure them before they are make visible. How do I handle that from the outside without having a table to "init functions" by section...
[14:09:51] <Whirl3d> *made
[14:11:30] <Whirl3d> In other words, should I try to compile all of the custom scripts for each section into it's own "scripts" document and use loadScripts to load them. If a script exists called "init" after loading, than go ahead and fire it?
[14:14:25] <scar> how do i use autocomplete to ONLY allow the user to select a dropdown menu item? is it possible?
[14:14:36] <Whirl3d> It seems reasonable that each section would have it's own initializing script for each "page" that it contains. then, having a common api implemented on each section's private methods would allow me to simply call "init" on the section once it was loaded and the section would initialize itself and load the first "page" of content.
[14:15:11] <Whirl3d> scar, isn't that just a standard "select" control?
[14:15:49] <scar> Whirl3d: yes, i mean like a textbox that when they type, they must select a jquery autocomplete option OR if they select outside of it, it will aUTO select the closest one?
[14:16:42] <Whirl3d> so if I am typing "applejack" and the closes one is "applesauce" when I ge to the letter 'j' what happens?
[14:17:06] <Es0teric> how do you grab the value of a input field? like this: $("#inputid").val();
[14:17:08] <Es0teric> right?
[14:17:25] <Whirl3d> yes
[14:17:51] <Es0teric> Whirl3d then why is it not working for me?
[14:17:52] <Es0teric> o.O
[14:17:56] <Es0teric> that doesnt make any sense
[14:18:19] <Whirl3d> without seeing your code, its like askin you why my scooter isn't running? It was running earlier?
[14:18:46] <Es0teric> no, Whirl3d.. lemme fiddle it real quick
[14:18:57] <Whirl3d> cool. that's the ticket!
[14:19:16] <scar> Whirl3d: the idea is i want them to only select a valid city
[14:19:23] <scar> i suppose the best way is to validate at the end
[14:19:40] <Whirl3d> personally, more than 80% of my questions have been answered when setting up a fiddle just cause it forced me to look at the issue out of context...
[14:20:11] <Whirl3d> scar, just give them a popup list of cities and don't give them the illusion of free will.
[14:20:14] <someprimetime> yo Whirl3d you going to jquerycon?
[14:20:32] <Whirl3d> nah. I wish though.
[14:20:59] <Es0teric> Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/GZ9Dg/1/
[14:22:04] <Whirl3d> Esoteric, when in a proverbial timeline are you asking for the value of the input?
[14:22:08] <Whirl3d> immediately
[14:22:20] <Whirl3d> I haven't even entered anything and you wanna know the answer
[14:22:25] <Whirl3d> that's why it's blank
[14:22:43] <Whirl3d> if you wait for an event and ask, the value might be different
[14:22:45] <Es0teric> Whirl3d well... naturally if the input is blank, i want to have a default setting
[14:23:02] <Es0teric> but i just want to see the input
[14:23:24] <Whirl3d> for example, $("#usrname").change(function () {console.log($(this).val());});
[14:23:58] <Whirl3d> Esoteric. your code fires immediately. So it is going to give you the reponse immediately...which is blank.
[14:24:26] <Es0teric> Whirl3d even if i put text in the input after submit?
[14:24:48] <someprimetime> Es0teric: you need to attach an event handler to it
[14:24:49] <Whirl3d> what do you mean by that?
[14:24:55] <someprimetime> attach an event handler to your button
[14:25:01] <Whirl3d> because yes, if you handle the submit event, it can happen after
[14:25:54] <Whirl3d> but if you mean just in the dom, no you can have it wherever in the dom, order doesn't so much matter when you have full access to the dom like jquery does...*(gross overexaggeration)
[14:25:54] <someprimetime> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/GZ9Dg/6/
[14:27:16] <Es0teric> someprimetime ahhh i see.. ok ok
[14:28:25] <Es0teric> Whirl3d i get it now though
[14:32:53] <Whirl3d> so does anyone have experience building an entire website...or is everyone here mainly doing odds and ends front end developement for a company where they solve the complicated user-interaction shit but aren't responsible for the architecture in general?
[14:34:13] <imachuchu> is there an easy way to change the label on a radio button through jquery?
[14:34:31] <Es0teric> Whirl3d well... building a whole site using a cms? or building a whole site from scratch?
[14:34:58] <imachuchu> I want 1 radio button that is either selected or not with a different value once it's selected ("Primary"/"Secondary", using jquery-ui radio button)
[14:35:36] <Whirl3d> from scratch. No cms, no prebuilt template. From the ground up?
[14:37:23] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: we usually build from scratch, but we use existing frameworks and extend them, e.g. bootstrap, django, node.js
[14:39:11] <Whirl3d> Eyepulp, Es0teric, thanks for the replies. I guess that's what everyone does...buidling one from scratch has proven to be a real bitch in terms of the decision making process.
[14:39:49] <Es0teric> yeah Whirl3d
[14:39:52] <imachuchu> Whirl3d: why reinvent the wheel?
[14:39:58] <Es0teric> i tried building one from scratch using codeigniter
[14:40:07] <Es0teric> but i am still not done
[14:40:08] <Es0teric> lmao
[14:40:37] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: there are a lot of considerations to make before deciding how to build things.  We have developers, and we code - so scratch built is not a negative, it's just a waste of time for a lot of the low-level bits.
[14:40:37] <mtanski> Hey guys, this might be a noob question butâ€¦ I couldn't find a strait answer on the googles (or docs) first.
[14:40:50] <mtanski> How do I extend jQuery but only inside my scope.
[14:44:21] <Whirl3d> sure. I am but one man with just enough jquery knowledge to produce some great looking pieces...making them work ensemble to pull off a website has proven to be much more didfficult than I expected.
[14:44:51] <RealityBall> lol I've built easy websites from scratch
[14:45:11] <RealityBall> but I probably won't be able to help you anytime soon
[14:45:13] <Whirl3d> And you would think that doing it for a "friend" would relieve some of the stress, but it makes it worse. a lot worse
[14:45:23] <Es0teric> Whirl3d speaking of which, i started off designing... so the difficult part for me is finalizing my design and coding it
[14:45:36] <RealityBall> I'm doing things for a family member haha
[14:45:38] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: if you're very good at one thing, it can be hard to reduce your expectations when jumping to another discipline (e.g. fronted to backend).
[14:46:03] <Es0teric> EyePulp yeah, backend work is difficult... front-end is slightly easier
[14:46:06] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: you may expect results or perfection above your skills in that new area
[14:46:38] <EyePulp> Es0teric: I disagree.  doing both is easy.  doing either *well* isâ€¦ a different sort of pain for each.
[14:46:48] <EyePulp> =)
[14:47:09] <Whirl3d> My biggest problem is refactoring...I see these common patterns that I spend so much time codingand afterwards reaslize, oh, that's just like the code I used for the footer or the thumbnail panel or ....
[14:47:11] <RealityBall> what is the best way to remove event handlers from elements?
[14:47:23] <Es0teric> EyePulp well i am only saying that because mysql is difficult for me.. and the php is kinda difficult too although working with both has made me better at OOP
[14:47:50] <Whirl3d> RealityBall, unbind? or .off?
[14:47:52] <EyePulp> I'm much faster to solve problems in a usable, long-term manner on the backend.  Front end though, I have endless thing I think need to be tweaked, or re-designed.  It takes me 6 times to get things to a barely acceptable point.
[14:48:19] <RealityBall> ahh thanks whirl3d
[14:49:22] <EyePulp> Es0teric: rdbms can be painful for anyone.  I just use postgres to make life easier. =)
[14:50:03] <Es0teric> lol EyePulp... true mongodb isnt all that bad either
[14:50:30] <EyePulp> Es0teric: Consider spending some time in Rails or Django - both are nice updates to the basics of web frameworks, and get away from a lot of the historical baggage php carries with it.
[14:51:06] <Es0teric> EyePulp yeah, i am actually going to learn python after i get comfortable with php
[14:51:19] <Es0teric> i am still not comfortable
[14:51:21] <Es0teric> with php
[14:52:25] <Es0teric> i do like the python syntax though... its pretty nice
[14:54:00] <EyePulp> Es0teric: if you're serious, and want a very solid walkthrough (unless you're already a programmer) Zed Shaw's "Learn Python The Hard Way" is a great set of lessons.
[14:54:38] <hd1> http://jsfiddle.net/xgPMV/1/ has some jquery code to generate a datatable... but it would appear the bottom border rides roughshod through the letters... where/how is this adjusted?
[14:54:44] <EyePulp> Es0teric: it's free online, or you can buy the book -- http://learnpythonthehardway.org/
[14:54:58] <Es0teric> EyePulp well i am mostly front-end right now... i just know how to do some back-end stuff too
[14:55:06] <hd1> i've found a CSS file that looks promising -- jquery.datatable.css
[14:55:13] <Es0teric> im far from beginner level though so i am a programmer i guess
[14:55:24] <hd1> but now am at a loss sa to what to change to achieve what i want
[14:56:54] <EyePulp> Es0teric: fair enough.  back to work for me.  l8r
[14:56:57] <EyePulp> =)
[14:57:17] <Es0teric> lol alright.. and thanks, EyePulp i'll definitely check out that series
[14:57:25] <Es0teric> bookmarked it :)
[14:58:32] <RealityBall> is it possible to unbind the event setInterval?
[14:58:46] <RealityBall> is setInterval considered an event?
[15:00:44] <Whirl3d> setInterval is not an event. if you have a reference to the orignal value returned by setInterval you can use clearInterval
[15:00:58] <Whirl3d> Though I usually find it's safest to use setTimeout
[15:01:06] <Whirl3d> and then reset it each time.
[15:01:20] <MysterOnyx> when I do .position(), left is the same as the css left, but top is not the same as css top.. it's off by about 25px.. any idea why?
[15:01:51] <Whirl3d> otherwise, on occasion, you have moved on to new content and suddenly your unexpected set inverval pops up the content you didn't want to see...
[15:02:10] <Whirl3d> could be a dozen things. Most likely it's css
[15:02:14] <RealityBall> oh god I know what you are saying is infinitely helpful but I am a bit confused
[15:02:20] <hd1> http://jsfiddle.net/xgPMV/1/ has some jquery code to generate a datatable... but it would appear the bottom border rides roughshod through the letters on the footer... where/how is this adjusted?
[15:03:17] <Zzaichik> wow - coffeescript is so sexy
[15:03:28] <Whirl3d> var t=setInterval(doSomething, time);     later you can do clearInterval(t)
[15:04:12] <hd1> specifically div#datagridBorder needs to be extended here
[15:04:17] <hd1> any ideas?
[15:04:43] <RealityBall> oh okay
[15:13:32] <saba> Is there any native way in jQuery to select elements based on the data object?
[15:14:20] <saba> I actually don't need to make a selector that checks the value, on the existence of a data key.
[15:14:54] <RealityBall> Whirl3d, thanks I got it working ;)
[15:15:01] <Es0teric> coffeescript is eh
[15:15:02] <johnkpaul> saba: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[15:15:07] <Es0teric> but i do like the syntax
[15:15:55] <saba> johnkpaul: I know it's possible to extend but I'm asking about native ways. I haven't found any yet, however I don't know about upcoming plans in jQuery
[15:16:26] <johnkpaul> saba: I don't believe there are any plans of adding that into future versions of jquery
[15:16:38] <johnkpaul> but if you need that functionality, that post has it exactly
[15:17:23] <saba> johnkpaul: I think I prefer using additional classes in this case. It's at least better than maintain both data-attributes and data
[15:17:35] <johnkpaul> yes, that is a better idea
[15:19:18] <saba> johnkpaul: nice page thought :-)
[15:20:45] <iateadonut> i'm binding a function to a class of input checkboxes that is reloaded.
[15:23:08] <shoky> (you are binding an event handler for checkboxes with a certain class. these checkboxes are then replaced by other ones)
[15:23:38] <iateadonut> shoky, you are a genious.
[15:23:54] <shoky> o?
[15:23:56] <iateadonut> genius
[15:24:02] <Whirl3d> what is the function in regex (or String maybe) that lets you take a string and parse it into an object like   thestring.split(regexp, function (prop1, prop2, prop3) {})   ....I can't quite remember it correctly...is it split, replace, test, match, exec, and is the method called on the string or the regexp?
[15:24:26] <iateadonut> well, they're replaced with the same checkboxes, but when i bind that same function to them, that function is no longer triggered.
[15:24:33] <iateadonut> (shoky, i thought you had given me the answer)
[15:25:00] <iateadonut> but when i put an alert in between the checkboxes reloading and binding, the bind DOES work.
[15:25:05] <iateadonut> so it's pretty crazy.
[15:25:13] <shoky> they are replaced with the same checkboxes?
[15:25:20] <shoky> no, new ones.
[15:25:29] <iateadonut> they are replaced with the same function that generated the original checkboxes.
[15:25:35] <iateadonut> and then i try to bind again.
[15:25:46] <iateadonut> if i put an 'alert' between those two, then the binding works.
[15:25:50] <iateadonut> with no alert, the binding does not work.
[15:25:57] <shoky> jsfiddle
[15:28:12] <shoky> Whirl3d i've no idea what you're referring to. can you explain what it does?
[15:28:52] <shoky> not that i know much about js regexp stuff, i'm just curious
[15:28:57] <Whirl3d> here's my regexp: var navReg = /\b(home|gallery|profile|contact)(?:\W(\w*))(?:\W(\w*))?(?:\?=(\w*))/;
[15:29:53] <Whirl3d> and given a hash of :  gallery-birds?=nosePicker    it returns an object like {section:gallery, topic:"birds", param:"nosePicker"}
[15:30:28] <Whirl3d> and it looks like ____(_____, function (gname, bname, pname) {return {section:gname....etc.
[15:30:29] <KorvinSzanto> how can I give an input focus?
[15:30:43] <Whirl3d> $("input").focus();
[15:31:15] <KorvinSzanto> lol
[15:31:17] <KorvinSzanto> f-me
[15:31:21] <Whirl3d> and I've tried    hash.split(regexp, function (.....     and hash.prelace(regexp, function.....
[15:31:21] <KorvinSzanto> thanky ou
[15:31:25] <Whirl3d> np
[15:31:43] <Whirl3d> and I am setting up to try regep.exec(str, func....
[15:31:57] <Whirl3d> I just used it two days ago and can't find it. UGGh
[15:33:51] <Whirl3d> it's String.replace
[15:34:03] <shoky> yeah i was just gonna say ;p
[15:34:35] <shoky> didn't know it accepts a function
[15:34:51] <Whirl3d> a function with declared parameters for capture groups
[15:34:58] <shoky> but.. does it really output an object??
[15:35:17] <Whirl3d> http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[15:35:27] <Whirl3d> naw, you gotta coax it
[15:35:30] <shoky> ah
[15:35:44] <shoky> nice trick i guess ;p
[15:36:57] <Es0teric> why is it that when the input is detected, it doesnt get the value of the put field and adds it to the user in config? http://jsfiddle.net/87fWm/
[15:38:17] <shoky> Es0teric: what?
[15:38:46] <Es0teric> shoky i basically want to pass the value in the input field into config.user
[15:39:09] <shoky> config.user = $('input').val()
[15:39:28] <Es0teric> shoky, sometimes that inputfield will be blank
[15:39:32] <shoky> and?
[15:39:38] <Es0teric> if its blank, i want it to replace it with my username
[15:39:53] <shoky> yeah?
[15:40:03] <Es0teric> if a username is typed in the input field, i want it to fetch that users data
[15:40:25] <Es0teric> hence the return false; commented out
[15:40:45] <shoky> what do you think that return false is doing?
[15:40:55] <Es0teric> submitting the form
[15:41:05] <shoky> return false is submitting the form?
[15:41:40] <Es0teric> well its allowing the form to submit
[15:41:53] <shoky> first of all, don't return false. do event.preventDefault() (or event.stopPropagation() if you need to)
[15:42:03] <Es0teric> alright
[15:42:13] <shoky> 2nd, why not handle the form submit event instead of the button click event?
[15:42:36] <shoky> 3rd, what is your question?
[15:42:43] <Es0teric> well thats the thing... i have a $.getJSON after the config (its not there on the fiddle but i have it on the IDE)
[15:42:59] <shoky> you have lots of things, great
[15:43:04] <shoky> what is the question though :\
[15:43:28] <Es0teric> shoky the question is how do i make it send another getJSON request after the input has a value?
[15:43:35] <shoky> i dont see any getJSON
[15:43:37] <Es0teric> but all without page refresh
[15:43:52] <Es0teric> shoky -> [06.26.12 â€¢ 06:42PM] ã€Š Es0teric ã€‹ well thats the thing... i have a $.getJSON after the config (its not there on the fiddle but i have it on the IDE)
[15:44:11] <shoky> if you want to prevent form submmission, handle the submit event and do preventDefault() on the event param
[15:44:22] <shoky> yes i saw you wrote that, i still dont see any getJSON
[15:44:37] <Es0teric> -_- give me a sec
[15:46:15] <shoky> i'm not sure , but it seems that you are confusing the order that you write your code in, with the order in which that code is actually being executed..
[15:46:27] <shoky> you did visitor=false
[15:46:39] <shoky> and the next thing you did is if (!visitor) ...
[15:46:49] <shoky> visitor will always be false there..
[15:46:56] <shoky> the click doesn't happen until later
[15:47:40] <Es0teric> right, shoky but if the click does happen
[15:47:48] <shoky> but it happens LATER
[15:47:54] <shoky> after you've already ran that if (!visitor)
[15:49:47] <Es0teric> right, shoky
[15:50:00] <Whirl3d> Es0teric, it's just like the last issue you were having.   step through it each line of code and evaluate your variables at each step in your head. You can see when/if the values change
[15:52:55] <Es0teric> shoky -> http://jsfiddle.net/87fWm/1/
[15:53:11] <shoky> why not a working jsfiddle?
[15:53:15] <shoky> with jquery
[15:53:30] <Es0teric> oh
[15:53:42] <Es0teric> shoky, use 2
[15:53:49] <Es0teric> i forgot to add jquery in there
[15:54:13] <shoky> you are still doing visitor = false. followed by if (!visitor)
[15:54:29] <shoky> that is plain wrong
[15:54:52] <Es0teric> shoky i am doing it AFTER the button click
[15:54:57] <shoky> no, you are not
[15:55:05] <shoky> you are doing it AFTER registering a click event handler
[15:55:14] <Es0teric> i see
[15:55:30] <Es0teric> so then doing it after the click is......
[15:55:39] <shoky> inside the click handler
[15:55:49] <shoky> that's when you know the click really happened.
[15:55:55] <shoky> that's what you set the event handler for in the first place
[15:56:01] <shoky> to know when a click actually happens.
[15:56:05] <shoky> and respond
[15:56:27] <shoky> if you want to send another getJSON after the click, do it in the click handler
[15:56:30] <shoky> etc.
[15:56:59] <Es0teric> yeah but sending another getJSON request after that seems abit... redundant
[15:57:04] <shoky> then dont ;)
[15:57:18] <Es0teric> but then how am i going to retrieve the user data?
[15:57:24] <shoky> so is it redundant or not ?
[15:57:49] <shoky> do you have new data that you want to get from the server?
[15:58:27] <Es0teric> shoky, yeah, the new data would be the data from the new username that was input
[15:58:42] <shoky> so you ONLY want to send a getJSON in response to the click
[15:59:01] <shoky> and not on page load
[15:59:03] <shoky> that's fine
[15:59:10] <shoky> currently you're doing it on page load
[15:59:19] <shoky> maybe you wanna move it into the click handler
[15:59:28] <shoky> (which you should change into a form submit handler...)
[15:59:53] <Es0teric> thats the thing though... if theres no click, i want it to stay with the the default username and send a request then.. but if a new username is input to send another request for that username
[16:00:08] <shoky> if there is no click you want to send a request, when?
[16:00:12] <shoky> after 10 seconds?
[16:00:16] <shoky> after a day?
[16:00:24] <Es0teric> after 30 secs
[16:00:27] <shoky> lol
[16:00:36] <shoky> are you making this up on the spot
[16:00:47] <Es0teric> kinda.. lol >.>
[16:00:50] <shoky> ;)
[16:01:01] <shoky> when you have a real question, please ;)
[16:01:17] <shoky> hope i gave you some pointers
[16:01:18] <Es0teric> ok the question is
[16:01:20] <Es0teric> how do i do it
[16:01:25] <shoky> totally restructure your code
[16:01:41] <Es0teric> i was thinking of encapsulating that getJSON into a function
[16:01:46] <shoky> i told you how
[16:02:32] <Es0teric> then calling that function when the click is fired and when its not fired (as default)
[16:03:04] <shoky> call it when its fired and when its not fired
[16:03:09] <shoky> === call it
[16:04:14] <Es0teric> shoky but would that make more sense?
[16:04:18] <shoky> no
[16:04:36] <shoky> how does it make sense to call something, when X happens and when X doesn't happen
[16:04:40] <shoky> so who cares about X ?
[16:05:13] <shoky> Es0teric: this is maybe a bit more in tune with what you wanna do: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/87fWm/3/
[16:05:25] <shoky> (it's what i have been telling you to do)
[16:05:42] <shoky> ah except that user:userName thing
[16:06:19] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/87fWm/4/
[16:09:03] <Es0teric> shoky, i see now... yeah that makes more sense
[16:14:40] <hye> hi
[16:15:22] <hye> what is a better way of doing this  $(this).children('.abc').children('.abctest');  ?
[16:15:35] <hye> as far as performance is concerned
[16:15:40] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: Putting the final touches on jQuery Mobile 1.1.1 RC1 for the San Francisco conference. See you there. â˜… http://bit.ly/OoYmDH
[16:15:43] <hye> i have to select by class, can't do by IDs
[16:17:44] <gnarf> hye: .find( "> .abc > .abctest" );
[16:18:05] <hye> isn't .find slow?
[16:18:11] <hye> i want to avoid .find due to performance
[16:18:15] <Hexasquid> That assumes they are direct descendants
[16:18:41] <hye> here is the structure <div class="abc"><div class="abctest"></div></div>
[16:19:19] <gnarf> um
[16:19:23] <gnarf> .find isn't slow
[16:19:26] <danheberden> gnarf dont think that'll work
[16:19:32] <Hexasquid> $(this).children('.abctest') ?
[16:19:42] <jenia> hello everyone.
[16:20:03] <danheberden> http://jsfiddle.net/TGsyg/1/ gnarf
[16:20:33] <jenia> i'm using jquery and im getting errors like this: unknown property zoom declaration dropped
[16:20:47] <jenia> and i go to the line and its in the jquery file:jQuery UI CSS Framework 1.8.21
[16:21:03] <jenia> is firefox not parsing jquery properly?
[16:21:04] <hye> hmm i dont know if i should use .find i was told that using .children or .parent is more sufficient and faster and it has proven to be
[16:21:22] <danheberden> also hye if you are hitting a situation where find is slow, youre probably over querying the dom
[16:21:40] <danheberden> children *is* faster
[16:21:58] <danheberden> but nothing you would probably notice
[16:22:13] <hye> i notice the difference in my app
[16:22:18] <danheberden> again, unless youre doing it wrong :p
[16:22:23] <hye> using .children and .parent i have reduced the time it takes to execute by 2/3
[16:22:36] <hye> no i am just iterating over alot of elements for calculation purposes
[16:22:40] <danheberden> are you caching objects?
[16:22:57] <hye> not yet, thats my next step
[16:23:03] <danheberden> lol
[16:23:04] <hye> i havent really looked into caching much
[16:23:10] <Whirl3d> lol
[16:23:10] <gnarf> .children().children() is going to be slower than .find( )
[16:23:26] <danheberden> do that before worrying about which method is slower
[16:23:36] <hye> my problem is that regardless of cache, it will still be slow on the first load
[16:23:41] <hye> that is the nubmer i am trying to get down
[16:24:02] <danheberden> over 10000 elements?
[16:24:23] <hye> no somewhere like 500
[16:24:28] <jexmex> http://www.sbrforum.com/betting-odds/tennis/
[16:24:41] <jexmex> the black area
[16:24:44] <jedimind> Hexasquid, you can always traverse with .find()
[16:24:46] <jexmex> not sure why I pasted it first
[16:24:53] <jedimind> to find a child element with a specific selector
[16:25:08] <jexmex> anyways the black area were the scores are kept, does anybody know if there is a jquery plugin that could do this effect?
[16:25:15] <danheberden> hye: i bet theres a lot of practical things you can do to see a speed improvement there
[16:25:21] <Whirl3d> lol. maybe you could use .find?
[16:25:24] <Whirl3d> lol
[16:25:36] <jedimind> we just met, and this is crazy, but you can use .find(), maybe?
[16:25:38] <jedimind> Hexasquid, ^
[16:25:51] <hye> danheberden sure, like ID selectors, looping through arrays instead of .each alot of stuff to dig through still
[16:26:10] <danheberden> oy vey
[16:26:21] <hye> i am just starting with the longst executing items
[16:26:49] <danheberden> curious, are you using the .data method?
[16:27:29] <hye> no
[16:30:39] <hye> danheberden ill take a look at .data to see if it can help me i havent read much up on it
[16:31:01] <danheberden> dont use it
[16:31:18] <danheberden> was just curious
[16:32:15] <jenia> hi everyone
[16:32:45] <jenia> for some reason my browsers throw dom exception when parsing the jquery1.8.2.ui.js file
[16:33:06] <jenia> can someone please tell me how to fix that problem?
[16:35:17] <hye> danheberden something weird i just cached an object, it made it slower
[16:36:41] <someprimetime> woops sorry internet crapped out
[16:36:44] <someprimetime> jenia: what browsers?
[16:36:54] <jenia> chromium and firefox
[16:36:58] <jenia> chrome
[16:41:23] <someprimetime> not sure but i'm wondering why $.browser is getting deprecated in 1.8?
[16:41:28] <someprimetime> @ajpiano++
[16:41:32] <kba> I'm having some difficulties maintaining loose coupling between classes with jQuery's AJAX methods. For instance, if I have a class Table responsible of the visuals, and another class DB responsible for all database contact, the usual approach you'd use is to have these completely decoupled. That is, first get some data, e.g. `var data = DB.get();` followed by adding it to the table with `Table.add(data);`, but because of the nature of asynch. nature of AJAX
[16:41:56] <shoky> jenia: what errors?
[16:42:07] <jenia> dom exception 12 errors
[16:42:29] <jenia> but im reading that 1.8.7 is out and apperently it has some bug fixes
[16:42:31] <kba> What would be the best way to circumvent this tight coupling? Right now I'm calling Table.add from within DB.get which is obviously wrong. I could addr a callback method to get() that would get called after after the AJAX request returns, but I'm hoping for a better alternative.
[16:42:41] <shoky> jenia: 1.8.21 is out ..
[16:42:49] <shoky> but jenia: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TGsyg/3/  no errors..
[16:44:06] <jenia> oh i get the error
[16:44:15] <jenia> its not an error but an exception thrown
[16:44:33] <shoky> yes, it's thrown because of an error, same thing
[16:44:38] <jenia> yes
[16:44:41] <jenia> thats what i get
[16:44:55] <shoky> then you have a weird setup ;p
[16:45:03] <jenia> oh okay
[16:45:25] <jenia> i'm using ubuntu. is it what you're using by any chance?
[16:45:39] <shoky> no. i'm not getting errors in chrome nor firefox
[16:45:51] <jenia> and you're using ubuntu?
[16:45:53] <shoky> no
[16:45:59] <jenia> oh maybe thats why
[16:46:02] <shoky> i doubt it
[16:46:05] <shoky> but maybe
[16:46:22] <jenia> yes me too. but ill try it out else where and i'll let you know
[16:46:24] <shoky> you got lots of extensions installed? ;p
[16:46:36] <jenia> ummmmmmm, no not particularly
[16:46:56] <jenia> i'll just try it out on another computer but not right now
[16:47:00] <jenia> i'm dead tired
[16:47:03] <jenia> enough for today
[16:47:05] <jenia> ;)
[16:47:07] <jenia> aight thanks shoky
[16:47:37] <shoky> just tried it in debian.. no errors
[16:47:38] <shoky> ;p
[16:48:05] <shoky> i'm pretty sure if i check ubuntu it'll be fine too
[16:50:30] <jenia> yes
[16:50:32] <jenia> damn
[16:50:35] <jenia> i dont know then
[16:50:46] <shoky> try disabling all your extensions, i dono
[16:50:57] <shoky> you just load that fiddle and the exception pops up in your console?
[16:52:48] <jenia> the console breaks before the exception and i can see the local variables in the side pane called "DOM exception error type 12"
[16:52:53] <KorvinSzanto> is there a javascript yes/no prompt?
[16:52:54] <jenia> thats in chrome
[16:53:02] <shoky> breaks where?
[16:53:10] <KorvinSzanto> instead of confirms ok/cancel
[16:53:43] <jenia> line 1904
[16:53:44] <jenia>  /*! jQuery v1.7.2 jquery.com | jquery.org/license */
[16:53:48] <shoky> KorvinSzanto: nope
[16:53:51] <KorvinSzanto> :(
[16:53:53] <KorvinSzanto> alright
[16:54:11] <KorvinSzanto> I never use the base javascript dialogs anymore, wasn't sure if it existed
[16:54:12] <KorvinSzanto> thanks
[16:54:40] <shoky> jenia, line 1904?  jquery minified is only 4 lines..
[16:55:06] <jenia> minified?
[16:55:12] <jenia> oh i have the whole file
[16:55:18] <shoky> you?
[16:55:22] <KorvinSzanto> the developer version
[16:55:23] <jenia> okay wait let me see where it breaks in the fiddle
[16:55:24] <shoky> aren't we talking about the fiddle?
[16:55:36] <jenia> yes let me check
[16:55:37] <shoky> k
[16:56:25] <shoky> jenia, do you get the error in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TGsyg/5/
[16:56:26] <jenia> yes it does break on line four in the mini.js file
[16:57:10] <jenia> and also on line 1373 in the mootools file
[16:57:25] <shoky> what chrome version?
[16:57:37] <shoky> (and does that latest fiddle throw the exception too?)
[16:58:45] <jenia> 18.0
[16:59:01] <jenia> the latest let me check
[16:59:04] <jenia> i check the original
[16:59:42] <jenia> yea the latest too
[16:59:49] <shoky> ok there's no jqueryui there ;p
[17:00:11] <shoky> smth else is going on with your browser(s), no idea ;]
[17:00:13] <jenia> so its something with the browser you think?
[17:00:17] <jenia> okay
[17:00:20] <jenia> thanks shoky

[17:06:16] <Whirl3d> how do I setup a custom selector that filters content based on a function that I provide...for example i want to be able to select the "current section" element using $(".section:current") which would run a function and return the section that fit my paramters for "current") any ideas?

[17:07:50] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[17:08:16] <Whirl3d> thank you!
[17:08:51] <Whirl3d> omg that is so nice.
[17:10:04] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[17:10:10] <johnkpaul> I agree, it's a great way to extend
[17:11:15] <Whirl3d> wow. I love :inView
[17:13:36] <tash> can I somehow maninpulate a <tr> based on some logic on a <td> within it?  If the <tr> has id of 'blah' ... and I want to do something like: if <td> is not empty, give <tr> a specific background color.  Is the <tr> considered the parent of the <td> in this context?
[17:21:41] <Whirl3d> so I'm using the prototype inheritance bridge model for my plugin and in it I attach a "controller" object to a dom element and use the controller object to handle all the functions/logic...can I then access controller properties like this:    $('elem').data("controller.currentIndex");  or do I have to do $("elem").data("controller")["currentIndex"] or $("elem").data('controller').currentIndex ?
[17:22:21] <Whirl3d> assuming that currentIndex was defined in the controller's prototype...
[17:22:25] <stan_man_can> I'm making rather large ajax posts to my server, is there any way to create a "progress bar" based on how long until the post is finished?
[17:28:05] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/UffTP/2/    I'm gonna go with $("elem").data("controller").currentIndex;
[17:28:07] <tash> I've got several table rows and they each have a <td> whose id is "jobend-X" where X is a unique ID.  Wouldn't this code say "if any of the jobend id's have a value, set the <tr> up with a green background color? http://pastie.org/4157430
[17:28:42] <Murg|e> Is it bad to say f it and do a page reload on ajax success to update data lol (Rhetorical)
[17:29:13] <tash> Murg|e: I've asked myself that question many times.
[17:30:11] <Murg|e> tash: I've just done it. I can't spend hours on items I have no idea about.  It sucks because it takes all this nice app smoothness and clunks it.
[17:30:28] <wroathe> Hey all. I'm having a minor issue with the jQuery UI Accordion and I'm wondering if anyone has solved a similar problem. Currently I'm using the change event to fire off an ajax request to get content for individual panels in my accordion -- problem is, I have no way of knowing how much content It's going to be retrieving.
[17:30:52] <wroathe> Right now it finishes the animation and then jerks and expands to the total width of the content
[17:31:05] <wroathe> And that's because it's only doing the animation for an empty div's worth of content
[17:31:33] <wroathe> I'm wondering if there's a good way of expanding that div and then performing the animation...
[17:31:44] <wroathe> Or at least telling the animation to wait until the content has loaded.
[17:31:54] <Murg|e> Wroathe, paste your code into jsfiddle.net and someone might be able to see what your issue is.
[17:32:11] <tash> anyone able to help me out with my parent question?
[17:32:44] <tash> I want to make the parent of my <td> to have a background color of green ( or blue, or red, or whatever )...I just need to understand how to mess with a parent element
[17:33:04] <wroathe> Murg|e: Will do
[17:33:04] <tash> Murg|e: totally understand the issue of clunking things
[17:33:43] <Blaster> hey guys can you select a <select><option>ABC</option></select> by the ABC text?
[17:34:09] <wroathe> https://gist.github.com/a26196bd0d2c57f580cd
[17:35:07] <wroathe> It's not so much a code problem or bug though, it's working as intended in that the animation works on an empty div. I need a way of telling the div how tall it needs to be for the content it's about to receive so that the animation is smooth
[17:35:37] <tash> Blaster: maybe .val() ?
[17:35:42] <LessSeen> tash: like this? $('td#some_id').closest('tr').css({"background-color":"red"}); or $('td#some_id').parent().css({"background-color":"red"});
[17:35:43] <tash> but it might have to have value=
[17:38:18] <tash> LessSeen: cool, thanks!
[17:39:18] <wroathe> Oh, I think I found a solution. Adding height to the div inline seems to work nicely with clearStyle
[17:39:33] <hye> how can I make this faster?  http://pastebin.com/aDcngvfS  i am using .each
[17:50:37] <reecefowell> can anyone help me understand why setInterval will not work on my jQuery plugin? http://jsfiddle.net/dqJ64/ it only seems to run the refresh method once and once only. It should run it once every second but it does not.

[18:28:32] <tash> man, struggling here ... if I have a bunch of <td>'s and their id's are like "jobend-X" ( where X is a unique number ), I want to change the background color of the row they are in if that <td> isn't empty
[18:29:40] <tash> I thought I should loop through the <tr>'s and do something like if ( "[id^=jobend-]".length > 0 ) { $(this).closest('tr').css({"background-color":"red"}); }
[18:29:50] <tash> but that changes every row in the table to background of red
[18:29:55] <Whirl3d> if I have a constructor function that I instantiate by using var other=new constructorFunc();  then other.prototype.do something()...it's not actually going to add the "doSomething" method to the original constructorFunc is it?

[18:44:25] <RohanBhangui> how do i check whether a div (with for example, class "header") has another class added to it (eg class: active) using an if statement?
[18:44:32] <johnkpaul> ?hasClass @RohanBhangui
[18:44:32] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .hasClass(): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[18:47:22] <johnkpaul> _Z3R0: can you show a demo of your problem?
[18:49:16] <otherj> would anyone mind helping me understand why this doesn't work? it's with jquery file upload and i'm just trying to update a badge number when an upload completes: https://gist.github.com/73701887a59339dea9f2   this is the docs: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API
[18:49:49] <_Z3R0> that is my problem
[18:49:58] <johnkpaul> _Z3R0: a live demo
[18:49:58] <_Z3R0> e.preventDefault is throwing an error saying the method doesn't exist
[18:51:02] <johnkpaul> otherj: where did you get "fileuploaddone" from?
[18:51:06] <_Z3R0> wait I think I know the problem
[18:51:33] <otherj> johnkpaul: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options
[18:52:11] <_Z3R0> yea thought so, nvm
[18:52:14] <johnkpaul> otherj: that's an event on the element, not a property passed to the options
[18:53:06] <otherj> johnkpaul: i tried using the 'done' callback, but never got it working
[18:53:10] <otherj> this is my second attempt
[18:54:09] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/mj26C/
[18:54:40] <RohanBhangui> how come when i check the console in google chrome i only get 1 set of values for the variable origin
[18:54:48] <RohanBhangui> as oppose to 6 sets?
[18:56:16] <johnkpaul> ?position @RohanBhangui
[18:56:16] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[18:56:35] <otherj> johnkpaul: any pointers on which direction to head? ;o)
[18:56:39] <RohanBhangui> how do i get 6 sets
[18:56:50] <RohanBhangui> i dont think you can ask the bot for help on this one
[18:56:53] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:57:13] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: did you read the docs?
[18:57:23] <johnkpaul> ?map @ RohanBhangui
[18:57:23] <caniuse> RohanBhangui: .map(): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[18:57:54] <johnkpaul> otherj: have you tried binding the event rather than passing the function in the option sobject
[18:58:20] <johnkpaul> otherj: .bind('fileuploaddone', handler)  rather than .fileupload({fileuploaddone:handler})
[18:59:49] <_Z3R0>  for those in question, apparently I was using 1.5.2 jquery not latest lol haha
[18:59:52] <otherj> johnkpaul: yeah, just realized i had a typo in my bind
[18:59:52] <otherj> lol
[18:59:53] <otherj> thanks
[19:00:00] <otherj> i think just asking makes me re-examine the code
[19:00:09] <johnkpaul> otherj: :) it happens, no problem
[19:00:24] <otherj> do you think there's a better way to do it than this/? https://gist.github.com/73701887a59339dea9f2
[19:00:29] <otherj> seems like my code's dirty for some reason
[19:01:30] <johnkpaul> otherj: well your indentation is very dirty
[19:01:34] <Murg|e> Anyone able to recommend a plugin for equal height columns for dynamic content?
[19:01:45] <johnkpaul> otherj: I don't think it'd be so bad if it were indented properly
[19:02:01] <johnkpaul> the existing flag is odd looking though
[19:02:05] <johnkpaul> reminds me of lots of php code
[19:02:27] <johnkpaul> also, parseInt takes a second parameter that you should always provide
[19:02:34] <otherj> oh, gist just didn't take the indentation properly
[19:02:36] <otherj> and i didn't fix it
[19:03:03] <johnkpaul> oh ok
[19:03:06] <otherj> i can look up the second parm, can you clue me into how youwould un-ugly the existing?
[19:03:07] <reecefowell> is there a way to express the contents of a var that would otherwise output 'undefined' when writing the object to console.log ?
[19:03:29] <otherj> hm. this says the radix parm is optional
[19:03:38] <reecefowell> i am expecting the object to be <abbr> tag
[19:04:35] <johnkpaul> otherj: use it, it's a best practice, it will screw you over sometime in your code's life
[19:04:59] <otherj> heh, alright
[19:05:05] <johnkpaul> otherj: var $count = $('.documentcount');$count.text($count.text() + 1);
[19:05:25] <otherj> cheers, that loks much better
[19:05:28] <RohanBhangui> wehn i use .animate on the targets do the positions get reset to 0 , 0 in terms of top and left (or left and top)
[19:05:32] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/mj26C/
[19:05:45] <RohanBhangui> and for once dont use the bot
[19:05:48] <johnkpaul> otherj: what programming language do you primarily work in?
[19:06:19] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: you're getting free help, why do you care if the bot is used or not?
[19:06:31] <RohanBhangui> nvm
[19:06:32] <otherj> johnkpaul: ruby
[19:06:46] <RohanBhangui> bot or no bot free help i am always grateful for
[19:06:48] <otherj> started with php when i was like 12 though
[19:07:13] <RohanBhangui> so?
[19:07:21] <RohanBhangui> with regards to my problem
[19:07:24] <johnkpaul> ah ok, just wondering otherj
[19:07:29] <RohanBhangui> i think it ahs to do wiht my css but not usre
[19:07:32] <RohanBhangui> *sure
[19:07:33] <otherj> oh, johnkpaul. the way you wrote this makes it literally apend a 1 to whatever the number was
[19:07:35] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: no, it shouldn't change top and left
[19:07:36] <otherj> so 3 becomes 31
[19:07:38] <johnkpaul> unless you're anmating top and left
[19:07:39] <otherj> haha
[19:07:48] <RohanBhangui> i am
[19:07:55] <johnkpaul> otherj: :) oops
[19:07:59] <RohanBhangui> im using aniamte to change the left and top proerties
[19:08:04] <RohanBhangui> but those sohuldnt change right?
[19:08:09] <johnkpaul> otherj: var $count = $('.documentcount');$count.text(parseInt($count.text(),10) + 1);
[19:08:11] <RohanBhangui> *they should change
[19:08:25] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: yes, they shoudl change
[19:08:26] <johnkpaul> ?eval
[19:08:35] <johnkpaul> damn you caniuse
[19:08:38] <RohanBhangui> okay
[19:09:04] <RohanBhangui> so how do i test aka print to console the values of each target
[19:09:14] <otherj> yeah, cheers. let's see if i can bind the destroy event successfully now
[19:09:22] <otherj> johnkpaul: you ever at confs? i owe you a beer
[19:09:46] <johnkpaul> otherj: yes, actually extremely often in june, but not necessarily that often in general
[19:10:16] <johnkpaul> if you're every in NYC, let me know and I'll take you up on that :)
[19:10:27] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: what do you mean the "values"?
[19:10:29] <gaspyr> hi folks
[19:10:43] <aberrant> anyone use jqplot?
[19:10:43] <RohanBhangui> top and left values
[19:10:45] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: have you ever used the webkit/firebug js debugger?
[19:10:55] <otherj> absolut!
[19:10:55] <RohanBhangui> i sue the google chtome console
[19:11:00] <RohanBhangui> chrome
[19:11:04] <RohanBhangui> chrome is my primary browser
[19:11:10] <johnkpaul> you sue them? you're going to lose ;-)
[19:11:10] <gaspyr> rohman use console.log()
[19:11:23] <gaspyr> console.log(stuff u wanna print)
[19:11:28] <otherj> oracle tried to sue and lost
[19:11:37] <gaspyr> then check ur console
[19:12:29] <johnkpaul> otherj: where are you from and what conferences were you thinking of?
[19:13:29] <RohanBhangui> gaspyr i tried that but i only have 1 set of values
[19:14:06] <otherj> johnkpaul: i'm from germany, but i come to america all the time
[19:14:15] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: targets.map(function(){return $(this).position();});
[19:14:16] <aberrant> so nobody's using jqplot? :(
[19:14:35] <johnkpaul> otherj: oh I see, well that might be the better place to get a beer, if I ever end up there
[19:14:38] <RohanBhangui> would target.each function work alos?
[19:14:40] <otherj> typically attend railsconf, jquery conf, ted stuff, etc. etc.
[19:14:41] <RohanBhangui> *also?
[19:14:47] <otherj> yeah, look me up if you come to berlin
[19:15:27] <RohanBhangui> lol
[19:15:32] <RohanBhangui> this meeting may take sometime
[19:15:34] <RohanBhangui> :)
[19:15:40] <johnkpaul> otherj: I'm actually in SF right now for jquery conf
[19:15:49] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: target.each doesn't return back an array
[19:15:58] <johnkpaul> but sure, you coul console.log inside that each function
[19:16:11] <RohanBhangui> ya thats what i was gonna do
[19:16:23] <reecefowell> nvm i worked out both my issues
[19:16:38] <aberrant> whoa
[19:16:47] <reecefowell> it seems you cannot use (this) with setInterval
[19:16:48] <aberrant> johnkpaul: there's a jquery conference now in SF?
[19:16:54] <aberrant> maybe I can get some help with my code :)
[19:17:07] <johnkpaul> aberrant: starts on thursday, I'm visiting family at the moment
[19:17:12] <aberrant> ah.
[19:17:17] <aberrant> moscone?
[19:17:25] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: you can, you just have to use $.proxy or Function.prototype.bind
[19:17:45] <gaspyr> sry was afk
[19:18:05] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: i created another function, which i pass the object to, then set the interval on that function
[19:18:08] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, no obligation or expectation here, but you had mentioned that you would think about good resources for how to build a site from scratch...wondered if anything came to mind..again, not a big deal if you didn't think of anything...
[19:18:20] <gaspyr> i saw two lines of all this post , from what i notice u need spùe way to cycle through a collection right ?
[19:18:45] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: http://pastie.org/private/felttliqxdk7uvegxwovaw
[19:18:49] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: yeah, that effecitvely does the same thing except using a closure to keep that state
[19:18:50] <gaspyr> what u need is as someone wrote above , the each thingy
[19:19:02] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I didn't really spend anytime thinking about it yet
[19:19:11] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: does that look good to you? what i did in the pastie
[19:19:14] <johnkpaul> well, other than learn.jquery.com
[19:19:26] <johnkpaul> which actually has a lot of good resources already, even thogh it's not live
[19:19:51] <Whirl3d> no problem. I'm not having jquery issues as much as I am getting the different "sections" of my content to work together...
[19:20:18] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: that works fine, I'm sure
[19:20:21] <johnkpaul> ?proxy @reecefowell
[19:20:27] <reecefowell> proxy?
[19:20:29] <johnkpaul> ?$.proxy @reecefowell
[19:20:34] <Whirl3d> I can work up a great section, but making them interact together by providing a common interface for each section is a lot more difficult tan I thought.
[19:20:39] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.proxy
[19:20:39] <caniuse> johnkpaul: jQuery.proxy(): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[19:20:42] <johnkpaul> ha, there we go
[19:20:42] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: im a total noob here at JS
[19:20:48] <reecefowell> so not sure what that does
[19:20:57] <johnkpaul> oh ok, reecefowell, so your code works but is fairly unidiomatic
[19:21:04] <aberrant> sigh. OK, so nobody uses jqplot. Anyone wanna help me figure out a way to get it working?
[19:21:14] <johnkpaul> you did this because you couldn't just use setInterval(obj.refresh, millis), right, reecefowell?
[19:21:21] <reecefowell> yeah
[19:21:33] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I know what you mean
[19:21:42] <johnkpaul> there aren't _that_ many resources for front end architecture
[19:21:48] <reecefowell> i wanted each instance to have  its interval set, i tried setting it in the init method setInterval(this.refresh, 1000); but that never worked
[19:22:21] <johnkpaul> well reecefowell, that's because the "context" is lost by setInterval which means that the reference to the keyword 'this' is no longer correct
[19:22:45] <johnkpaul> in newer browsers, you could have done, setInterval(obj.refresh.bind(obj), 1000)
[19:22:45] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/pGCdP/43/ how come when you click on one of the images on the left, it adds it as a thumbnail, but then doesn't display it in the right pane?
[19:23:00] <someprimetime> or at least not the first one
[19:23:13] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: that will work if i cut and paste?
[19:23:32] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: no idea, but I wouldn't try it if you don't know what I'm doing
[19:23:45] <gaspyr> are u having the damn closures prob :D ?
[19:23:50] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: all got to start somewhere
[19:24:05] <gaspyr> or the var self = this idiom ?
[19:24:06] <johnkpaul> :) it wasn't intended to be a dig reecefowell
[19:24:07] <reecefowell> its been 50% research, 50% random guessing
[19:24:36] <johnkpaul> yeah, I know, just try to look into why your random guessing works if it does, or why it doesn't
[19:24:44] <reecefowell> i know, i just mean though that, gonna make some mistakes, and i think the code you pasted looks simple enough
[19:25:01] <reecefowell> i saw something like what you said on the mozilla documentation
[19:25:11] <reecefowell> entitled 'the this problem'
[19:25:18] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/mj26C/1/
[19:25:22] <RohanBhangui> johnkpaul
[19:25:30] <RohanBhangui> it returns 0 again
[19:25:33] <RohanBhangui> 0,0
[19:25:35] <johnkpaul> yeah, reecefowell, the meaning of 'this' is fairly confusing at first
[19:25:41] <Murg|e> Anyone able to recommend a plugin for equal height columns for dynamic content? Everything I've tried so far calculates the div height by adding all the child elements (including dynamic hidden content)
[19:25:45] <RohanBhangui> when i print out values after aniating
[19:25:46] <reecefowell> i get 'this', i work in php
[19:25:49] <RohanBhangui> *animating
[19:26:15] <reecefowell> also, i do C#, Java and some other bits here and there. But Javascript is by far the most confusing language ive ever worked in :p
[19:26:18] <johnkpaul> ah, reecefowell, I see what you're confused about
[19:26:23] <gaspyr> recef , wats the prob, maybe u can help u
[19:26:24] <johnkpaul> when your last targets.each() runs
[19:26:28] <johnkpaul> the animation is _not_ finished
[19:26:45] <RohanBhangui> so what is the fix?
[19:26:48] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: any dynamically and weakly typed on that list?
[19:27:05] <gaspyr> just piece of advice u gotta be very patient when learning some JS
[19:27:06] <reecefowell> php is weakly typed
[19:27:19] <johnkpaul> it is definitely confusing at first, I'll give you that, but it's not that much more complex than ruby IMHO
[19:27:24] <reecefowell> sorry dynamically typed
[19:27:30] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: it's actually both
[19:27:31] <gaspyr> it's too confusing becuz its too different comapred to other languages
[19:27:33] <reecefowell> i never liked ruby
[19:27:33] <johnkpaul> PHP wasn't on your list though
[19:27:47] <reecefowell> yup it was, i said it before the list :P
[19:28:03] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: target.animate().promise().then(function(){//log your positions here})
[19:28:13] <reecefowell> i think what you meant though was weak vs statically typed
[19:28:18] <johnkpaul> oh, right reecefowell
[19:28:34] <johnkpaul> no, that's not the right dichotomy
[19:28:41] <reecefowell> c#/java etc is statically typed, php is weakly typed. but its all good
[19:28:42] <johnkpaul> weak vs strong and static vs dynamic are different concepts
[19:28:44] <RohanBhangui> would i have to hcang ethat for both .each functions
[19:28:59] <gaspyr> nope C# isnt fully :p
[19:29:05] <johnkpaul> where are the resident PHds of javascript to give the proper explanation?
[19:29:09] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: interesting, i never knew that
[19:29:11] <gaspyr> did u try LINQ ?
[19:29:14] <johnkpaul> if you ask in #javascript, they'll give you the official jargon that I don' tknow
[19:29:25] <gaspyr> it uses the var thingy in C#
[19:29:28] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: so static vs dyanmic means, do you have to declare types on vars or not
[19:29:33] <johnkpaul> java and c# are statically typed
[19:29:40] <johnkpaul> you have to specificy that something is an int or a List
[19:29:42] <gaspyr> nope john
[19:29:58] <reecefowell> haha we have opened a can of worms here
[19:30:07] <gaspyr> C# grants u possibility to use var stuff
[19:30:10] <johnkpaul> weakly and strongly typed has to do with if type coersion is used when using regular operators/functions
[19:30:21] <johnkpaul> ah, sorry, gaspyr, then just change it with java
[19:30:29] <johnkpaul> I didn't know taht, I've only used C# for hours of my life
[19:30:29] <gaspyr> np bro :)
[19:30:37] <johnkpaul> Java is definitely statically typed and only statically typed
[19:30:43] <reecefowell> i dabbled in a bit of everything
[19:30:45] <gaspyr> well thats why i wanted to point that out
[19:30:48] <reecefowell> but still much i don't know
[19:31:07] <gaspyr> actually for real and intersting use of dynamic types in C# try LINQ
[19:31:22] <reecefowell> mostly i work in php, but i am more of a 'lets get a bunch of stuff done' rather than 'the ins and outs of a nats butt' lol :P
[19:31:22] <gaspyr> oh ya on Java i agree xD
[19:31:31] <gaspyr> im actually a Java guy
[19:31:38] <reecefowell> i dislike java really
[19:31:44] <gaspyr> ;(
[19:32:07] <reecefowell> i don't like its poor imitation 'native ui's they never fit in well
[19:32:20] <reecefowell> and Java is slow and laggy
[19:32:26] <gaspyr> only thing i dislike about it is some kind of lack of great free content and the too restrictive entreprise attitude
[19:32:35] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: slow and laggy?
[19:32:40] <johnkpaul> I definitely agree that swing is horrible
[19:32:42] <gaspyr> java is elegant and flexible
[19:32:48] <reecefowell> swing is def very ugly
[19:32:49] <johnkpaul> but even the people who work on swing would say that it's horrible
[19:32:54] <gaspyr> swing is way too ugly xD
[19:32:57] <johnkpaul> but I don't think of java as slow and laggy
[19:33:07] <gaspyr> forgot to mention that im for java EE :D
[19:33:08] <reecefowell> java and elegant are not 2 words i would ever use in a sentence :P
[19:33:12] <johnkpaul> it's sometimes frustrating to work with, but I don't mind it that much
[19:33:27] <johnkpaul> :) go try guava gaspyr and tell me if it's elegant
[19:33:38] <gaspyr> but anyway gave up on desktop very quikly
[19:33:51] <reecefowell> the lack of pointers of references in java sucks hard
[19:33:55] <gaspyr> mmainly used .NET with desktopop stuff, VB then C#
[19:34:01] <reecefowell> *pointers or references
[19:34:18] <gaspyr> the opposite, the fact that java have built in referneces is good
[19:34:19] <RohanBhangui> still doesnot work johnkpaul
[19:34:29] <gaspyr> otherwise u wud waste tons of time debugginh
[19:34:49] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: fiddle?
[19:34:49] <gaspyr> when u r a dev and not a programmer, trust me u wont have time for pointers xD
[19:35:03] <RohanBhangui> lol
[19:35:12] <RohanBhangui> hold
[19:35:14] <RohanBhangui> john
[19:35:16] <gaspyr> if u want pointers u can use em in C# with unsafe code
[19:35:27] <reecefowell> i find the lack of free and dedicated official IDE's suck, i mean netbeans is yuck, so is eclipse. No where near as good as Visual Studio imho (and i use a Mac, go figure :P )
[19:35:28] <gaspyr> though tbh better go use C++
[19:35:47] <gaspyr> : p
[19:35:59] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/mj26C/2/
[19:35:59] <gaspyr> did u see the IDEs of Jetbrains ?
[19:36:03] <RohanBhangui> think i messup
[19:36:13] <gaspyr> they ve IntelliJidea
[19:36:14] <reecefowell> gaspyr: yeah, Jetbrains looks really sweet
[19:36:25] <reecefowell> but it looks ugly on mac
[19:36:31] <gaspyr> u know , im addicted to Jetbrains stuff
[19:36:47] <reecefowell> but if i was on windows, Jetbrains would be definitly my main IDE if i had to program in Java
[19:36:51] <gaspyr> regarding eclipse, ill honestly say that i so like its violet color
[19:37:14] <gaspyr> lets say simple and cute , thats eclipse :)
[19:37:25] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: so if i use what you suggested earlier, setInterval(obj.refresh.bind(obj), 1000) how does bind work?
[19:38:23] <gaspyr> but again there is netbeans though professionals dont really use it, lastly ive seen a dev from dotCMS team admit they use eclipse
[19:38:36] <gaspyr> and without any plugin xD , just like me lol
[19:38:37] <reecefowell> yuck and yuck
[19:38:48] <reecefowell> TextMate FTW
[19:38:49] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/mj26C/3/
[19:39:12] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: it won't work in old ie's without the es5shim
[19:39:18] <gaspyr> VS is well excellent IDE, but poor documentation and intelissense on WPF 4
[19:39:28] <gaspyr> no idea if they fixed it in VS 2012
[19:39:30] <johnkpaul> but what that does is pass the function obj.refresh to set interval with the reference 'this' pointing to obj
[19:39:36] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: so i should stick with my proxy method?
[19:39:37] <johnkpaul> basically, hardcoded to obj
[19:39:49] <johnkpaul> no, not necessarily
[19:39:57] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: lol
[19:40:04] <reecefowell> so what should i do?
[19:40:05] <johnkpaul> if you need old IEs, I'd either use the es5shim, or use $.proxy
[19:40:15] <RohanBhangui> john: doesnt work
[19:40:23] <RohanBhangui> no position to console
[19:40:36] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: setInterval($.proxy(obj.refresh,obj), 1000)
[19:40:40] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: can you mod my code or give me an example that i can duplicate/refactor?
[19:40:44] <johnkpaul> just did
[19:40:46] <reecefowell> ah
[19:40:48] <reecefowell> ditto :p
[19:40:58] <gaspyr> wats wrong guys ?
[19:41:08] <gaspyr> IE trouble xD
[19:41:14] <reecefowell> is proxy a jQuery or javascript thing?
[19:41:35] <gaspyr> 1sec i check my jquery doc
[19:41:50] <gaspyr> im server side guy, not client side :D
[19:41:58] <reecefowell> its hard to try and google it because i get a bunch of sites offering me proxy servers :P
[19:42:14] <reecefowell> gaspyr: me too, im all about the Symfony2
[19:42:33] <reecefowell> unfortunately i am a 1 man team, so i have to dabble in the html and javascript *shiver*
[19:42:38] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: it's a jquery thing, it's their way of fixing old ie's
[19:42:47] <gaspyr> ah funny, was tryna check some php and a guy told me to pick sym2, but i may go Yii framework
[19:42:57] <johnkpaul> reecefowell: I'm fairly sure that it delegates to .bind under the hood if it's there
[19:42:58] <reecefowell> damn, why does IE have to have to much suckage
[19:43:12] <gaspyr> and im in the same spot as u reece, i learn to handle all :/
[19:43:13] <reecefowell> gaspyr: noooo go SF2, its truly amazing
[19:43:16] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: you're going to look ath the code that I wrote
[19:43:33] <RohanBhangui> i did
[19:43:34] <gaspyr> well reece take this link first
[19:43:37] <RohanBhangui> it doesnt make sense
[19:43:40] <RohanBhangui> can you explain
[19:43:42] <reecefowell> johnkpaul: thanks you have been very helpful
[19:43:45] <gaspyr> http://help.dottoro.com/
[19:43:50] <johnkpaul> no problem reecefowell
[19:43:57] <gaspyr> the full JavaScript doc
[19:44:05] <reecefowell> you can just call me reece :)
[19:44:14] <gaspyr> btw proxy couldnt find it anywher in my jQuery reference guide
[19:44:25] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: so what I did was write some code to provide you a function that would be called when all of teh animations are finished
[19:44:28] <johnkpaul> you can do whatever you want in that function
[19:44:34] <gaspyr> i bet it shud be some pure js
[19:44:41] <johnkpaul> I just copied and pasted what you did earlier, , but you can hange that
[19:44:48] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.proxy @gaspyr
[19:44:49] <caniuse> johnkpaul: jQuery.proxy(): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[19:45:07] <gaspyr> ah really , oops sry guys
[19:45:15] <reecefowell> that proxy approach works really nicely
[19:45:21] <RohanBhangui> so how do i call it?
[19:46:22] <raj> in a nested $.each(function{$.each(function{})}) can I break out of the inner each without breaking out of the outter each?
[19:46:44] <reecefowell> raj: return?
[19:47:02] <RohanBhangui> john: >	so how do i call it?
[19:47:23] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: it's already called, look at the line that's after promises).then(function..
[19:47:35] <johnkpaul> whatever goes in that function will run after all of your animations are complete
[19:47:42] <gaspyr> raj this kind of issues shud be possible if JS implements conditionnal lables or whatever they call em
[19:47:49] <RohanBhangui> okay os then why isnt anyhting being written to console
[19:48:03] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: something is being written to the console
[19:48:13] <johnkpaul> ?each @raj
[19:48:13] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .each(): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.  http://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:48:21] <johnkpaul> in those docs there is a return condition
[19:48:24] <johnkpaul> for continue and break
[19:48:33] <raj> k, i'll check it out
[19:48:43] <raj> thank you
[19:48:47] <gaspyr> in Java we do this :  repet :  while( )
[19:48:47] <gaspyr>                                 {
[19:48:47] <gaspyr>                                          for( ; ; )
[19:48:47] <gaspyr>                                         {
[19:48:47] <gaspyr>                                               if ( )     break  repet;
[19:48:48] <gaspyr>                                         }
[19:48:48] <gaspyr>                                 }
[19:48:57] <reecefowell> gaspyr: thats a no no :P
[19:49:04] <johnkpaul> gaspyr: use a pasting service
[19:49:06] <reecefowell> pastie
[19:49:07] <coldhead> sweet paste bro
[19:49:09] <gaspyr> repet is the label's name
[19:49:13] <boobah> gaspyr: http://pastie.org/
[19:49:17] <reecefowell> coldhead: LOL
[19:49:20] <gaspyr> oops didnt know sry
[19:49:43] <raj> johnkpaul, so simply returning false will break out of the inner each, but not the outter?
[19:50:26] <johnkpaul> raj, you pass a function to each, in javascript, the return statement returns from the current function
[19:50:48] <reecefowell> gaspyr: before i get back to work, if you decide to use SF2 instead of Yii, i might be of some help :) just drop me a line on here or my blog (same as my username .com)
[19:50:54] <gaspyr> http://pastie.org/4157889
[19:51:14] <RohanBhangui> john: its writing 0,0
[19:51:18] <gaspyr> oh ty :D, but first need find some time for that
[19:51:31] <gaspyr> cuz im J2EE mainly
[19:52:18] <johnkpaul> RohanBhangui: have you looked through fixingthesejquery.com?
[19:52:38] <gaspyr> i added ur blog to my favorites :)
[19:53:15] <raj> johnkpaul, got it, thank you
[19:53:16] <reecefowell> thanks :D
[19:53:27] <reecefowell> ill be adding a lot more stuff to my blog very soon
[19:53:36] <johnkpaul> I'm headed out too
[19:53:41] <johnkpaul> have a good night/day everyone
[19:53:47] <gaspyr> wish u good luck especially on ur 1 man handle tactci :)
[19:53:52] <gaspyr> tactic
[19:53:55] <reecefowell> also run a dev site, its a big ghostly atm, but the whole forum is custom code by myself (all as bundles for Symfony2)
[19:54:03] <reecefowell> thanks johnkpaul
[19:54:14] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun with javascript!
[19:54:19] <reecefowell> man handle?
[19:54:27] <gaspyr> :D fun or headaches
[19:54:35] <reecefowell> im very confused right now :p
[19:54:55] <gaspyr> i dunno how to say it, im talkin about fact that u solo deal with client side and server side
[19:55:04] <reecefowell> oh right
[19:55:08] <reecefowell> its difficult at times
[19:55:50] <RohanBhangui_> john could it be my css which is giving me wrong values for my left and top properties?
[19:55:58] <RohanBhangui_> cuase here is the issue
[19:56:22] <reecefowell> specially when dealing with Javascript related stuff. JS code is often tricky to work with, often debugging is difficult when output usually says 'undefined' which is very unhelpful, then there are JS devs liberal use of anonymous functions which totally confuses you when trying to understand the scope of vars etc.
[19:56:42] <gaspyr> rohm when dealer with cross browser compatibility better try to look for some tools that generates code for various browsers
[19:56:58] <RohanBhangui> was that for me?
[19:57:00] <reecefowell> gaspyr: does lint not help in that regard?
[19:57:03] <gaspyr> yu
[19:57:09] <RohanBhangui> okay
[19:57:14] <RohanBhangui> but here is the thing
[19:57:20] <RohanBhangui> i am using google chrome
[19:57:22] <RohanBhangui> and thats it
[19:57:25] <RohanBhangui> no cross browser
[19:57:29] <RohanBhangui> when i use absolute
[19:57:34] <gaspyr> well for both of u guys if u run into this kind of probs
[19:57:35] <reecefowell> jsfiddle.net check lint and it will help get your code ready for multiple browsers.
[19:57:58] <RohanBhangui> i dont get good postioing but my postioning number sare okay
[19:58:03] <gaspyr> haha rohan u r like me, but u know i now start using opera
[19:58:07] <RohanBhangui> (like i ge thte values i want)
[19:58:11] <RohanBhangui> when printing to ocnsole
[19:58:33] <RohanBhangui> when i use relative i can get the postioing values to print out properly
[19:58:37] <gaspyr> opera has built in irc , thats overkill xD
[19:58:48] <reecefowell> opera â€¦. yuck
[19:58:57] <gaspyr> cmon :p
[19:58:59] <RohanBhangui> opera is not bad
[19:59:05] <RohanBhangui> firefox has chatzilla
[19:59:07] <RohanBhangui> im using amod
[19:59:08] <reecefowell> Safari + Chrome
[19:59:08] <gaspyr> try it reece ull love
[19:59:16] <RohanBhangui> where chatzilla can run independant of firefox
[19:59:21] <reecefowell> i did, i did not love it :P
[19:59:23] <gaspyr> not to mention opera dragonfly
[19:59:27] <RohanBhangui> ugh
[19:59:33] <tw2113> xchat on linux
[19:59:34] <RohanBhangui> can we stop showing off browsers
[19:59:39] <gaspyr> best console dev
[19:59:47] <RohanBhangui> opera is being bought by facebook
[19:59:49] <RohanBhangui> game over
[19:59:50] <RohanBhangui> okay
[19:59:52] <RohanBhangui> now
[19:59:53] <reecefowell> LOL
[19:59:55] <gaspyr> omg ?
[20:00:00] <RohanBhangui> gaspyr
[20:00:00] <tw2113> it was rumored
[20:00:02] <reecefowell> facebook will get bored of it, then they will terminate it
[20:00:06] <gaspyr> omg xD
[20:00:21] <reecefowell> just like most buyouts in the software industry by giants
[20:00:25] <gaspyr> had no idea about this :(
[20:00:26] <RohanBhangui> can you take a look at my code and tell me if my css is playing foully?
[20:00:30] <reecefowell> MS, Appl, Google do it all the time
[20:00:30] <RohanBhangui> i know that isnt a word
[20:00:35] <gaspyr> sure
[20:00:44] <reecefowell> RohanBhangui: pastie.org
[20:00:47] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/mj26C/4/
[20:00:54] <reecefowell> or fiddle :p
[20:00:57] <RohanBhangui> yup
[20:00:59] <RohanBhangui> love fiddle
[20:01:06] <RohanBhangui> salute to the fiddle developers
[20:01:15] <reecefowell> wow what is happening
[20:01:19] <reecefowell> buttons appearing everywhere
[20:01:35] <gaspyr> first time i c this fiddle , good to c new tools ::)
[20:01:53] <reecefowell> you using border-radius to get them cool buttons?
[20:02:08] <Murg|e> Anyone able to recommend a plugin for equal height columns for dynamic content? Everything I've tried so far calculates the div height by adding all the child elements (including dynamic hidden content)
[20:02:40] <gaspyr> border radius my fav css3 property
[20:03:01] <RohanBhangui> reece fowell
[20:03:03] <gaspyr> rohan gimme a sec i read and try figure out what and where is the prob
[20:03:08] <RohanBhangui> what browser are you using?
[20:03:25] <RohanBhangui> gaspyr can you please use chrome fi installed
[20:03:29] <RohanBhangui> *if
[20:03:33] <RohanBhangui> its wokrs best on there
[20:03:45] <gaspyr> ok i go chromee
[20:03:49] <reecefowell> RohanBhangui: your code seems very slow, and if i click add i get an error 404
[20:04:00] <RohanBhangui> dont worry about add
[20:04:05] * tw2113 views the fiddle in firefox anyway
[20:04:06] <RohanBhangui> havent programmed that yet :)
[20:04:11] <reecefowell> RohanBhangui: i use Safari
[20:04:18] <RohanBhangui> use chrome
[20:04:21] <RohanBhangui> i devleoped i nthere
[20:04:22] <reecefowell> no :P
[20:04:29] <RohanBhangui> and you might get weird results in ther browsers
[20:04:32] <reecefowell> Safari is basically the same as Chrome anyway
[20:04:33] <RohanBhangui> lol
[20:04:37] <RohanBhangui> oh
[20:04:38] <reecefowell> both are Webkit browsers
[20:04:49] <reecefowell> infact, Chrome is mostly Apples work
[20:04:58] <RohanBhangui> lol
[20:05:01] <boobah> lol
[20:05:15] <gaspyr> the prob is with the position of the rohan label right ?
[20:05:40] <RohanBhangui> yes the ones with .header
[20:05:43] <RohanBhangui> they have postions
[20:05:46] <reecefowell> Apple borrowed KHTML, refactored it, rewrote it, called it Webkit, open sourced it and worked on it for years for their browser, Safari. Google used it to make chrome. Its all the same really.
[20:06:22] <RohanBhangui> but when i console.log their postions they are giving me 0,0
[20:06:24] <RohanBhangui> for top and left
[20:06:34] <boobah> Mozilla is basically the same as Netscape anyway
[20:06:36] <RohanBhangui> do you think my css postion: relative is messing aorund
[20:06:46] <RohanBhangui> enough with the browsers!!!!
[20:06:52] <RohanBhangui> ie won a long time ago!!!
[20:06:55] <gaspyr> class="click"
[20:07:11] <RohanBhangui> not that
[20:07:19] <RohanBhangui> that need to be rative to hte screen width
[20:07:19] <gaspyr> header seems to be for some items that oad from somwhere, they actually dont show up here
[20:07:23] <tw2113> i'm still trying to figure out the intended usabilty and whatnot in RohanBhangui's idea
[20:07:27] <RohanBhangui> the ones that are .header
[20:07:35] <gaspyr> lis
[20:07:37] <RohanBhangui> tw2113
[20:07:39] <reecefowell> IE won by default, not because it was world class.
[20:07:48] <gaspyr> wat u wanna fix in them ?
[20:08:09] <RohanBhangui> i want to make it so that when i read there postion i want there left and top values relative to hte screen
[20:08:27] <RohanBhangui> for ge thte relative to screen part
[20:08:36] <gaspyr> ahhhhhh
[20:08:55] <gaspyr> ive done that once when i just started js
[20:09:38] <coldhead> ?offset
[20:09:38] <caniuse> coldhead: .offset(): Set the current coordinates of every element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[20:10:12] <coldhead> thanks caniuse
[20:10:33] <tw2113> you're welcome coldhead
[20:10:38] * tw2113 is speaking for caniuse 
[20:12:21] <gaspyr> uh just stupid question, did u chhoose onload or domReady in the list ?
[20:12:59] <Whirl3d> so, rohan, you are trying to make a "flower" of sorts when a section is selected?, then clicking on the background leaves of the flower would expand the pedals?
[20:13:13] <Whirl3d> sorry, RohanBhangui
[20:14:03] <gaspyr> i try to test but 404, butt hmm lol i think u righht about the flower
[20:14:19] <RohanBhangui> yup flower is what i want to do
[20:14:27] <RohanBhangui> avoid the htnl form for now
[20:14:31] <RohanBhangui> *html
[20:14:33] <gaspyr> ahhh now i understand
[20:14:50] <RohanBhangui> its like a tree
[20:14:57] <RohanBhangui> i click one element that exands
[20:15:11] <RohanBhangui> *expands a first set of elements
[20:15:36] <RohanBhangui> when one of these are clicked a second set are opened and the rest are hidden and so on and so forth
[20:15:44] <tomasm-> hi, is there an equivalent of content.appendTo(container) that works with html(), ie in the reverse syntax to set the entire content instead of append?
[20:16:03] <gaspyr> u mean a slider widget right ?
[20:16:07] <RohanBhangui> sry i made this channel #RohanBhangui help
[20:16:18] <Whirl3d> can jquery animate rotation yet? or is this handled only by css?
[20:16:22] <gaspyr> yes tomasm
[20:16:47] <gaspyr> there is, u can eiter use pure js => .innerHTML
[20:16:51] <gaspyr> or
[20:18:08] <tomasm-> gaspyr, i meant for method chaining, to properly do $(content).hide().htmlWith('#container').fadeIn() .... or maybe it doesnt matter since it's the whole container
[20:18:23] <tomasm-> I just want to fadeIn() the content that's changing, but no more
[20:19:09] <gaspyr> hmm
[20:20:19] <tomasm-> gaspyr, I have some situations that use replace or append instead of html(), and so I needed to properly chain fadeIn() so as to only fade in that chunk, but since with html() it IS the full content, I probably can do $('#container').hide().html(content).fadeIn()
[20:22:08] <RohanBhangui> gaspyr any help with my problem
[20:22:29] <gaspyr> but if u hide the whole container how would the inner elements appear
[20:23:22] <tomasm-> gaspyr, magic
[20:23:30] <gaspyr> hmm i dunno weird, what if u remove border's of container to make it look like it disapeared with some invisible color
[20:23:50] <coldhead> i have no idea what's going on
[20:23:55] <RohanBhangui> what?
[20:23:59] <gaspyr> and play with fadein and fadeout with inner elemnts, or maybe im mistaking or thinking in a different way
[20:24:01] <RohanBhangui> who is everyone tlaking to
[20:24:09] <RohanBhangui> cause too many people are using too many pronouns
[20:24:15] <gaspyr> was talking to tomasm :D
[20:24:19] <RohanBhangui> oh
[20:24:24] <gaspyr> rohan, back to ur fiddle now
[20:24:27] <RohanBhangui> can you help
[20:24:30] <RohanBhangui> or shuld i ask tom
[20:24:31] <tomasm-> gaspyr, yes, I believe so, what i figured makes sense to me, it also works, so i'm not fretting anymore
[20:25:11] <tomasm-> RohanBhangui, fiddle or pastebin or something
[20:25:21] <gaspyr> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/mj26C/4/
[20:26:41] <RohanBhangui> @tomasm: 1 step ahead
[20:40:50] <tash> how do you check a checkbox with jq? .attr('checked', 'checked') ?
[20:42:19] <tash> n/m got it
[20:43:24] <Murg|e> Anyone able to recommend a plugin example for equal height columns with dynamic content? Everything I've tried so far calculates the div height by adding all the child elements (including dynamic hidden content).
[20:43:59] <gaspyr> @tash ^^

[20:46:48] <Forbidd3n> anyone here familiar with ckeditor

[20:50:33] <Murg|e> later
[21:07:02] <louism2_> hello all,
[21:08:29] <louism2_> probably a very noob question but I am wondering if you update a page with ajax (say, add a comment or something), how can you access that comment?  If you are adding that css id dynamically, how can you check if it is visible without reloading the page?
[21:12:06] <o]> louism2_: not sure if I got your exact question, but you can query attributes with jQuery api
[21:12:28] <louism2_> o]: thanks for the response
[21:12:34] <o]> var value = $(something).attr("attrname");
[21:13:08] <o]> take a look on the api for the css() function. perhaps you can query styles too. I never tried that
[21:13:54] <louism2_> ok, but lets say I have just updated the page and inserted a div with id = "comment3".  If I look at the source, that id does not exist.  Is there any way to check on that div that I just inserted via ajax without reloading the page?
[21:14:11] <louism2_> using ajax
[21:15:19] <o]> $("#comment3)
[21:15:22] <o]> $("#comment3")
[21:15:56] <o]> take a look on jquery selectors and DOM traversal
[21:16:07] <louism2_> o]:  this is what I was looking for http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5675085/check-if-element-exists-after-ajax-load
[21:16:21] <louism2_> ajaxcomplete apparently
[21:16:52] <o]> yes! complete will execute always after error or success
[21:19:29] <louism2_> o]: thanks for your help
[21:31:50] <o]> louism2_: you are welcome. it is always good looking on jquery api docs or even on stackoverflow before asking here, since this channel has little traffic
[21:32:43] <louism2_> yeah, I am a Ruby guy and I went the Ruby route and wasn't having any luck.... probably should exhausted jquery/ajax first
[22:07:56] <oneseventeen> is there a way to refresh stuff after you .append() some HTML? (because I'm adding something that should be triggering a $('.classname').click() function.
[22:12:48] <Murg|e> I've been struggling to find a solution for equal column heights with in the same rows that have expandable content. If anyone might have a suggestion, take a look at http://staging.myhyperlinker.com/ and let me know. Thx.
[22:16:06] <JeremieDeNoob> Hi guys, I am making a jqgrid which I am trying to upload the data back into the mySQL table... I do not know what to do...
[22:17:12] <JeremieDeNoob> there is a nice example on trirand.net/demophp.aspx but it does not save... i understand that there is no code there to connect to the database and save
[22:17:25] <JeremieDeNoob> is there somewhere where i could find such a code? been looking since yesturday...
[22:18:01] <JeremieDeNoob> basically I would like to have something like the inline navigator (under the edit, add, delete rows menu) example working on my computer...
[22:24:51] <oojacoboo> what's the selector for an element that has part of a value in it's attribute?
[22:24:57] <oojacoboo> 	$(el).find('li.search-result a[id*="-result-"]').removeClass('search-hover');
[22:25:16] <oojacoboo> I have that right now, not sure if it's working correctly in all cases
[22:25:38] <oojacoboo> I want to match all id's that have "-result-"
[22:29:51] <oojacoboo> nm, I figured it out
[22:41:59] <granden> Which would be a good place to start when looking for jQuery plugins? as plugins.jquery.com is down
[23:04:09] <coldhead> granden: google the kind of plugin you are looking for
[23:06:33] <Whirl3d> ?tell RohanBhangui, here is something to look at...it's not what you want, but it might get you closer: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6vuE2/38/
[23:06:42] <newbiee> i did $curobj = $next.prev().prev().parent and console.log in that and got [div .item_edit] in the firebug now when i tried doing $($curobj +" span).click it gives me unrecognized expression
[23:09:15] <coldhead> you probably want $('span', $curobj)
[23:09:26] <coldhead> or $curobj.find('span')
[23:09:45] <coldhead> + is trying to concatenate an object and a string
[23:09:48] <coldhead> it's not good times
[23:09:54] <newbiee> i want $curObj.show()
[23:10:04] <coldhead> do that then
[23:10:04] <newbiee> even this is not working $($curObj).show();
[23:10:20] <coldhead> you don't need $() around something that is already created with $()
[23:10:31] <coldhead> did you ever see that movie inception?
[23:10:33] <coldhead> it's like that
[23:10:45] <coldhead> and to a lesser extent, the phantom tollbooth
[23:11:14] <newbiee> not working
[23:11:44] <Whirl3d> isn't $(elem).prev().prev().parent()==$(elem).parent()?
[23:12:05] <coldhead> that's a good question, Whirl3d
[23:12:19] <mazzachre> Whirl3d: I would think so
[23:12:49] <mazzachre> Whirl3d: Without any testing though, it is just intuitive, and hence I would think so, because jQuery normally does what is intuitive
[23:13:11] <Whirl3d> so, newbiee, it's not working cause you are selecting the wrong element in $curObj
[23:13:27] <sacho> ==?
[23:13:38] <newbiee> the click functionality worked
[23:13:39] <sacho> did you mean a js comparison there, or just that they will hold the same dom element?
[23:13:55] <coldhead> the latter, sacho
[23:14:00] <coldhead> don't worry about it
[23:14:08] <Whirl3d> sorry, just that they were the same. I wasn't trying to be specific...
[23:14:15] <Whirl3d> force of habit
[23:14:45] <coldhead> the point is we can access our parent without accessing the parent of our sibling's sibling
[23:14:57] <coldhead> and also that incest is wrong
[23:15:05] <coldhead> for many important reasons
[23:15:08] <sacho> Whirl3d, if the element doesn't have two previous siblings, the previous will return an empty jquery object
[23:15:18] <Whirl3d> or even funnier, our next siblings previous sibling. previous sibling's parent
[23:15:20] <sacho> ..the left side
[23:15:31] <hiland> Anyone have some insight into this issue:
[23:15:31] <hiland> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=125148
[23:15:40] <Whirl3d> $.next().prev().prev().parent()
[23:15:48] <granden> coldhead: But I'm right now not looking for any specific, just wanted to browse whats avilable :)
[23:15:52] <sacho> if there is no next element that will return empty as well
[23:16:31] <Whirl3d> what if you did $.next().next().end().css('opacity",0);
[23:16:33] <coldhead> granden: then google for "best jquery plugins" or "awesome jquery plugins" and read any of the blog posts that compile people's favourites
[23:16:45] <coldhead> smashing mag etc have many such
[23:16:51] <Whirl3d> what if there was no .next.next
[23:17:00] <coldhead> hiland: did you try #chromium ?
[23:17:04] <Whirl3d> does the empty set remember it's chain?
[23:17:11] <granden> coldhead: :) Ok then.
[23:17:33] <coldhead> the empty set has no chain
[23:17:56] <hiland> coldhead: I'll ask there too, I'm just not convinced it's not a jQuery bug.
[23:18:04] <Whirl3d> okay, that's it. I am convinced that the empty set chainability thing is not right  at least for me
[23:18:39] <Whirl3d> I like the chainablility notion but if an empty set breaks the chain, the chain is broken folks. whether you return undefined or a empty set
[23:19:15] <sacho> Whirl3d, just wait until you hit $.html('asd') vs $.html(undefined)
[23:19:38] <Whirl3d> say again?
[23:20:07] <Whirl3d> it would be undefined.html()
[23:20:17] <Whirl3d> rather than $().html()
[23:22:02] <coldhead> hiland: if you can catch paul_irish he's a good guy to ask
[23:22:05] <sacho> damn, can't repro it
[23:22:16] <coldhead> @ him on twitter if need be
[23:22:40] <Whirl3d> I wrote an .or method but I think I got yelled at last time for doing it...$(".one").or(".two")....
[23:22:47] <hiland> coldhead: Thanks, I'll try to catch him
[23:23:33] <sacho> Whirl3d, what is it supposed to do?
[23:24:01] <Whirl3d> just like it says, select the one class if possible OR select the other if not
[23:24:17] <Whirl3d> I think people prefer $(".one,.two").first();
[23:24:44] <Whirl3d> but you can see how the problems mount with that one...
[23:25:44] <Whirl3d> $.fn.or=function () {return this.length===0?$(arguments):this}
[23:26:11] <coldhead> i like your or(), Whirl3d
[23:26:14] <coldhead> haters gonna hate
[23:26:29] <Whirl3d> true dat, true dat
[23:27:19] <Whirl3d> do you know if the 1.8 specs for animate include rotation and 3D trnasforms?
[23:28:04] <thomedy015> okay so hashchange isn't necessarily the best approach to animating i have realized
[23:28:08] <thomedy015> it leaves a gap
[23:28:21] <thomedy015> for the way my site is structured
[23:28:27] <Whirl3d> hashchange and animate?
[23:28:29] <thomedy015> cuz i  have a link on the navigation
[23:28:50] <thomedy015> and thena  seperate anchor with the same link or if you press the same link again
[23:28:54] <Whirl3d> what do you mean it leaves a gam?
[23:29:13] <thomedy015> content doesn't load on hash change so i am going to do the load and animate the same way but on window.load
[23:29:28] <Whirl3d> no
[23:29:36] <thomedy015> okay .... why
[23:29:46] <terryleigh> how do I output a json object as a json string?
[23:30:28] <Whirl3d> the only thing you have to do when your page loads, is check if there's a hash value assigned. If there is. take then there. So for your site, show them the home menu, pause and take them where they need to go
[23:31:33] <Whirl3d> or intercept it all together on ready (by hiding all content until you can check the hash) and then if no hash, show the main menu
[23:31:39] <JeremieDeNoob> does anyone here use jqgrid?
[23:31:45] <thomedy015> i was thinking grab the hash on load
[23:31:53] <thomedy015> and then do the same process i already have
[23:32:10] <Whirl3d> where is the problem then?
[23:32:20] <thomedy015> none
[23:32:26] <thomedy015> i was just talkin like i do
[23:32:28] <Whirl3d> I just never trust the load event
[23:32:29] <thomedy015> im a talker
[23:32:34] <thomedy015> really?
[23:32:37] <Whirl3d> really.
[23:32:46] <thomedy015> can you tell me why
[23:32:55] <Whirl3d> I always use document.ready...supersititious, I guess
[23:33:08] <Whirl3d> It just acts differently for every browser
[23:33:21] <thomedy015> i can grab the has on doc.ready right
[23:33:28] <Whirl3d> sure
[23:33:34] <thomedy015> well then im sett
[23:33:37] <thomedy015> cuz thats all i need
[23:33:47] <Whirl3d> but I personally like to hide all my content automatically anyways
[23:34:09] <Whirl3d> then I decide when the user sees it, not some smart ass browser that's gonna have half my shit loaded
[23:34:23] <Whirl3d> lol
[23:34:27] <thomedy015> okay.... cool
[23:34:32] <thomedy015> i was thinking about that oo
[23:34:33] <thomedy015> too
[23:34:40] <thomedy015> cuz it loads in a very awkward fashion
[23:35:08] <thomedy015> yeah that will absolutely solve it
[23:35:12] <thomedy015> 0kay im on it
[23:35:13] <Whirl3d> I wanted to show you an idea I had about your navigation...
[23:35:26] <Whirl3d> but I haven't done it yet. so let me decribe it to you
[23:35:58] <thomedy015> describe a way... while i build the onready thing
[23:36:01] <Whirl3d> right now, you have the panels slide open to the left to show your sections...if you are on the first section, you open to the right...
[23:36:40] <Whirl3d> but after that first animation (from the main menu), they are all always sliding in from the right
[23:36:48] <thomedy015> wait do they
[23:36:51] <thomedy015> i didnt realize that
[23:36:53] <thomedy015> your probably right
[23:37:05] <thomedy015> so many details
[23:37:18] <Whirl3d> but what if you put the NEW content that someone wants directly below the current content visible and all
[23:37:27] <Whirl3d> then animate the top off to the right
[23:38:02] <Whirl3d> the content you user wants to see is then immediately available--no animation to track. the stuff they have seen can blur and slide off--who cares?
[23:38:26] <Whirl3d> when I say the topoff to the right..I meant the "current"' content off to the right
[23:38:48] <Whirl3d> revealing the already solid, configured and loaded new content beneath
[23:39:12] <Whirl3d> then, every section will open that same way so it's consistent.
[23:39:41] <thomedy015> its worth a thought
[23:39:42] <thomedy015> for sure
[23:39:45] <newbiee> on calling ajax function to post data it is being posted more than once or thrice
[23:40:35] <thomedy015> im thinking about it right now
[23:40:58] <thomedy015> you know what i have made so many versions of this project...
[23:41:02] <thomedy015> i m talking tons
[23:41:15] <thomedy015> im just going to finish this version and go from there
[23:41:23] <thomedy015>  i need to launch cuz my portfolio = 1
[23:41:27] <thomedy015> not very solid
[23:41:42] <thomedy015> i cant look for clients with portfolio = 1
[23:47:39] <Whirl3d> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/3DHoverEffects/   I love this effect.
[23:48:00] <coldhead> thomedy015: you can if you did a good job
[23:48:03] <coldhead> its 1 more than 0
[23:48:07] <Xotix> if i set a css value with jquery, can i somehow delete it again? e.g. i set outline: 2px solid blue; and no i don't want to set it to none but remove it.
[23:48:24] <thomedy015> i think i did
[23:48:28] <thomedy015> www.lcchico.com
[23:48:40] <thomedy015> its at least decent
[23:48:46] <thomedy015> but i have learned so much since then
[23:48:49] <thomedy015> SOOOOO much
[23:49:07] <thomedy015> and yes good poing coldhead
[23:49:13] <thomedy015> point
[23:49:27] <thomedy015> im going to start searching again for clients so i dont have to work 2 jobs
[23:49:37] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, you can muck about with style prop/attr
[23:49:37] <thomedy015> i hate getting up at 4 every morning
[23:50:02] <Xotix> blackspotwiggins:  you mean  getting the style string and replace? i know i could do that butâ€¦ hm
[23:50:15] <blackspotwiggins> well, i actually meant unsetting/deleting it
[23:50:19] <Whirl3d> thomedy, get in good with an attorney or two and you'll have plenty of work.
[23:50:56] <thomedy015> really i can prob do that
[23:51:02] <thomedy015> im actually pretty good with words
[23:51:59] <ldz420> I have a canvas tag within the div .  The canvas tag has an event listener add the div (x,y) coordinate to pass the div (x,y) into the event listener
[23:52:54] <ldz420> I know that I can attach information in the data variable but don't know how to get the (x,y) of parent container
[23:54:20] <blackspotwiggins> ldz420, .parent().offset() ?
[23:55:47] <newbiee> i have <div><div></div><div></div><div><input></div></div> i nned to get the input object after the first div
[23:55:54] <ldz420> blackspotwiggins: now do you know if that is the absolute or relative position?
[23:55:57] <newbiee> i tried using siblings after the first div but gave me empty
[23:56:56] <blackspotwiggins> ldz420, position() is relative to offset parent, offset() is relative to page 0point
[23:57:52] <ldz420> blackspotwiggins: ok I will check it out again
[23:58:01] <ldz420> blackspotwiggins: thanks
