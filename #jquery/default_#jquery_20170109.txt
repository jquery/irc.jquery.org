[01:34:10] <JohnMcClain> Is there a ready-to-go script for something which would allow me to find the highest rank of a div and add another section of it (Add Row {which is a form})? I believe each div would need some identifier so I could identify the rows upon submission

[02:37:09] <exospecies> hi, i'm doing a $selector.each loop, and when log $(this) it doesn't have an .attr property, but it does have $(this)[0].attributes['my-attr']... any idea why this is?
[02:56:20] <arunkumar413> Is <line> a css selector?
[03:00:56] <exospecies> $selector is .find(':input')
[04:30:55] <tausif> hi folks
[04:50:17] <Popzi> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/pXvdXLz624HWnAlIdg0O/ what's wrong with my Jquery? It's not taking the response from my Python framework... :\
[05:09:42] <Popzi> https://hastebin.com/osisupizej.xml eh, can anyone help? I'm new to JQuery
[05:11:45] <Popzi> 470 busy people online :(
[05:37:06] <AdamPDotty> Do not ask to ask!
[05:37:16] <AdamPDotty> Do not ask for specialists!

[05:37:50] <AdamPDotty> State your problem, ask your question!
[06:11:03] <dglambert> morning
[07:03:02] <Inky_> how do i get more detailed error message from $.ajax? the standard error callback returns  jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown but for e.g. in the case of a client side connection problem, chrome logs "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED" but all i get from the error callback is "error" without any details what the problem is..
[07:23:32] <Woet> Inky_: you checked all those variables?
[07:32:37] <Inky_> Woet: yes. jqXHR.statusText and textStatus are both just "error", errorThrown is undefined
[07:33:01] <Woet> Inky_: i guess you'll need to get some library that does a connection check
[07:38:03] <Cork> Inky_: js can't get more info then that if the connection problem comes from network issues
[07:38:24] <Cork> the new (read not stable) fetch command is meant to fix some of those limitations
[08:00:50] <DelphiWorld> hi jQueryers
[08:00:57] <DelphiWorld> i have the following button declared: <button id="callBTN" type="button">call!</button>
[08:01:27] <DelphiWorld> and i am handling the click with the following function:
[08:01:28] <DelphiWorld> $("#callBTN").click(function(){
[08:01:35] <DelphiWorld> but it's not getting any event ?
[08:02:09] <drvanon> Hi am using jsrender and jquery. When I call $("...").render I get a CPS error. https://jsfiddle.net/
[08:04:07] <DelphiWorld> this is my full code: http://paste.debian.net/907943/
[08:04:49] <Woet> drvanon: that link doesnt help
[08:05:01] <drvanon> Woet: my error
[08:05:03] <drvanon> https://jsfiddle.net/ddy9454s/
[08:05:05] <Woet> DelphiWorld: use jsfiddle and get rid of unnecessary code
[08:05:42] <Woet> drvanon: no error on that page.
[08:05:54] <DelphiWorld> Woet: want to  fiddle me? it's totaly tricky for screen reader's software
[08:06:34] <drvanon> Woet: this is strange, the error changed when I submitted it...
[08:06:52] <Woet> DelphiWorld: i see no reason why .click() wouldnt work in your code, so yes, a reproducible fiddle would help.
[08:07:11] <DelphiWorld> Woet: yes, want to make it from my url i give you?
[08:07:19] <Woet> DelphiWorld: a working test case, yes please.
[08:07:30] <DelphiWorld> Woet: mind the url in pm?
[08:07:40] <Woet> DelphiWorld: you already pasted the code.. why would it be a pm?
[08:08:12] <DelphiWorld> Woet: yes, that was a pastebin, but i'm giving my own domain & server url, and this nice channel is full of other people's we dont know ;)
[08:08:27] <Woet> DelphiWorld: cant you just put it on fiddle?
[08:08:28] <DelphiWorld> i mean my test page url, because i can't create a fiddle url
[08:08:46] <DelphiWorld> fiddle is totaly inaccessible to me, Woet
[08:08:51] <Woet> DelphiWorld: https://jsfiddle.net/xeycm91p/2/
[08:08:53] <Woet> oh.. okay
[08:08:53] <Woet> why?
[08:09:03] <DelphiWorld> Woet: i use screen reader
[08:09:08] <Woet> oh.. ok
[08:09:08] <DelphiWorld> fiddle A11I is totaly tricky
[08:09:08] <Woet> sorry
[08:09:15] <Woet> sure
[08:09:22] <Woet> but it comes down to your code working fine
[08:09:30] <DelphiWorld> see pm Woet
[08:09:47] <DelphiWorld> its strange isn't clickable
[08:11:00] <Woet> DelphiWorld: did you check the console?
[08:11:19] <DelphiWorld> Woet:  i try to check firebug in firefox, but yay... unreadable
[08:11:39] <Woet> CONFIGURATION_ERROR: Missing parameter: sockets
[08:11:56] <DelphiWorld> Woet: but that's not the problem actualy
[08:12:05] <DelphiWorld> the problem is the button itself not clickable
[08:12:14] <Woet> DelphiWorld: yes.. and theres an error in the code above it.
[08:12:33] <DelphiWorld> isn't alert is the first line?
[08:12:43] <DelphiWorld> why the alert isn't showing
[08:12:58] <Woet> no.. its line 14.
[08:13:03] <DelphiWorld> hold on
[08:13:15] <DelphiWorld> let me reorder it
[08:13:55] <Cork> DelphiWorld: also don't use alert for debugging
[08:14:12] <DelphiWorld> korlol if the console become accessible! :P
[08:14:14] <Cork> browsers has special cases for alert, so you can't depend on it actually telling the truth
[08:14:24] <Cork> use console.log instead
[08:14:24] <DelphiWorld> Cork:  lol if the console become accessible! :P
[08:14:45] <Cork> DelphiWorld: depending on the browser it should be
[08:14:48] <DelphiWorld> Cork: ah got the point
[08:16:04] <Cork> to be a bit more explanatory: alert "stops" the execution, this means the browser has to fake execution order in some cases that can't stop
[08:16:17] <Cork> this means sometimes it can run twice, or in the wrong order
[08:16:23] <DelphiWorld> i got it
[08:16:52] <Cork> it can also cause the browser to hung in some other cases :)
[08:20:44] <DelphiWorld> Woet: can we actualy confirm if the phone object is created?
[08:21:43] <Woet> DelphiWorld: im not sure what you mean
[08:22:05] <DelphiWorld> Woet: i am calling this:  phone.start();
[08:22:13] <DelphiWorld> is the phone object created?
[08:22:23] <Woet> DelphiWorld: why dont you just fix the error and go from there?
[08:22:49] <DelphiWorld> because, i am wondring if the phone object is the problem
[08:23:06] <Woet> it tells you what the problem is
[08:23:07] <Woet> CONFIGURATION_ERROR: Missing parameter: sockets
[08:23:19] <Woet> http://www.jssip.net/documentation/2.0.x/api/ua_configuration_parameters/#parameter_sockets
[08:23:20] <DelphiWorld> and the socket param is there:
[08:24:09] <Woet> DelphiWorld: its not
[08:24:16] <Woet> DelphiWorld: theres ws_servers, uri and password
[08:24:32] <DelphiWorld> and i thought ws server should be the socket's starting point...
[08:24:35] <DelphiWorld> old doc, ...
[08:26:11] <DelphiWorld> Woet: got it
[08:26:16] <DelphiWorld> it should be newer...

[08:33:28] <Woet> you're gonna have to figure out a way to read the console
[08:33:29] <DelphiWorld> ok, i am lost. will reread
[08:53:20] <developer904> Hello everyone, I’m looking to add a dialog box to each dynamic link ID. This is what i have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/yr7brsyx/
[08:55:01] <Inazad> hi there, I got a jQuery error after WP updates to 4.7 (fitVids is not a function)... I tried to update the fitvids javascript file, not working more... How i can fix this issue ?
[08:57:20] <Xatenev> Hi
[08:57:38] <Xatenev> I did $("#myDiv").insertAfter("<div id='test'></div>");
[08:57:40] <Xatenev> That should work or?
[08:59:02] <shoky> Xatenev: no.  a.insertAfter(b)   inserts a after b.   you probably want .after(..)
[08:59:09] <Xatenev> zzz
[08:59:49] <Xatenev> ty
[08:59:51] <Xatenev> dumb err
[09:00:15] <Popzi> https://hastebin.com/berikukeca.xml New to JQuery, anyone got anything that could point me in the right direction to accomplishing this?
[09:01:35] <Inazad> someone ?
[09:01:39] <Xatenev> Popzi: Use a simple template wrapper to have your HTML seperated from your JS logic. https://www.sitepoint.com/overview-javascript-templating-engines/
[09:02:09] <Xatenev> shoky: The funny thing was, I even tried .after() and it didn't work .... cause I had a syntax err
[09:02:12] <Xatenev> x)
[09:02:43] <shoky> that's not funny :D
[09:03:09] <Xatenev> In some sad way.. :p
[09:03:10] <Popzi> Xatenev: I actually use Datatables to display some other information from a Python Query that I could reuse, is it possible to send the data to that? I dunno if DataTables will support this kind of data though
[09:03:38] <Xatenev> I never used datatables. no idea
[09:07:08] <shoky> Popzi: the easy (and not too nice) answer to your question is you can just append any html you want, be it a <table> or a <p>. bit nicer is to build it out of jquery objects e.g.  var table = $('<table>'); table.append(...);  var tbody = $('<tbody>').appendTo(table);  ... var link = $('<a>').attr('href', response.url).text(response.title).appendTo(..);  and so on
[09:07:35] <shoky> Popzi: but as was said, it's best to use some templating solution
[09:07:55] <DelphiWorld> Woet: happy...
[09:08:02] <shoky> Popzi: another option also is to have the table already in your html to begin with, and just fill it with data (and show it) whenever you need to
[09:08:03] <DelphiWorld> the web socket part is working
[09:08:13] <DelphiWorld> but the button isn't clicking actualy
[09:08:19] <Woet> did you check the console?
[09:08:28] <Popzi> shoky: Thank you, I've just found out that DataTables supports Ajax responses, so I'll try using that, which will also match up with other data I already off, from the same CSS file :) convenient
[09:08:28] <DelphiWorld> yes i am checking it
[09:08:40] <Popzi> I've already got*
[09:08:46] <DelphiWorld> Woet, the click handler isn't getting executed
[09:09:43] <Woet> DelphiWorld: theres a reason people recommend having scripts before </body> instead of inside <head>
[09:09:52] <Woet> DelphiWorld: your code is executing before the HTML, there's nothing to bind on.
[09:11:30] <AdamPDotty> no good reason though
[09:11:56] <DelphiWorld> Woet: oh...
[09:12:26] <Xatenev> AdamPDotty: It >was< a good reason.
[09:12:34] <Xatenev> AdamPDotty: Not anymore with HTML5 .
[09:13:27] <DelphiWorld> Woet: but now i moved the scripts to the footer but same
[09:15:51] <developer904> Hello Im looking to add a dialog box to each dynamic ID link. This is what i have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/yr7brsyx/
[09:17:12] <FilipNortic_> DelphiWorld: first step check the selector for the click handler in the console and see if you find it. If you do then there is something wrong either with the binding or with the handler...
[09:19:47] <FilipNortic_> developer904: that code is wierd in so many ways...
[09:21:48] <developer904> FlipNortic_ I’m selecting the headline div link and trying to grab the id of each link
[09:22:43] <FilipNortic_> developer904: you're passing focus to a click handler... then you get the id of the clicked element and select it again by id
[09:23:08] <laravelnewbie> hello
[09:23:15] <laravelnewbie> is there a way to do this in js?
[09:23:17] <laravelnewbie> @foreach ($array  as $arrayId => $arr)
[09:24:25] <developer904> FlipNortic_ ok I thought I needed to bind the click to a focus
[09:24:46] <shoky> laravelnewbie probably. what does that do :)
[09:24:51] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[09:25:10] <AdamPDotty> my answer would be: yes, but
[09:25:11] <laravelnewbie> okay, my array instead of having 0 1 2 3 4 5, it has the id
[09:25:17] <FilipNortic_> developer904: what is a focus?
[09:25:17] <laravelnewbie> I want to grab that
[09:25:37] <shoky> laravelnewbie: you have an array of objects with ids, and you want to get an array of just the ids?
[09:25:37] <FilipNortic_> the focus event?
[09:26:10] <developer904> FlipNortic_: yes
[09:26:25] <laravelnewbie> shoky: I want to return everything, but I want to get the index number of the array
[09:26:47] <FilipNortic_> developer904: ok, no there click() is short for .on("click,..)
[09:27:02] <shoky> laravelnewbie: hard to understand you.. give an example?
[09:27:03] <FilipNortic_> and focus is an on("focus",...)
[09:27:10] <laravelnewbie> wait a sec
[09:27:21] <AdamPDotty> if it is a real array you go for (var arrayId in array)
[09:27:33] <shoky> uh no you don't
[09:27:42] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[09:27:48] <AdamPDotty> yep, but often it is not
[09:28:16] <laravelnewbie> "history": { "15": { "number": 9, "others": {
[09:28:19] <laravelnewbie> I want the 15
[09:28:37] <laravelnewbie> it's the index right? shoky
[09:28:44] <AdamPDotty> the key
[09:28:45] <developer904> Ok FilipNortic Guess thats my first issue
[09:28:45] <shoky> laravelnewbie: no it's the key
[09:28:51] <laravelnewbie> index key?
[09:28:52] <laravelnewbie> xD
[09:28:57] <AdamPDotty> not indexed
[09:29:02] <shoky> laravelnewbie:  to get all keys of an object you can use Object.keys(obj)
[09:29:02] <laravelnewbie> ah okay, just key
[09:29:14] <laravelnewbie> dont like that
[09:29:21] <shoky> you can loop over it
[09:29:31] <FilipNortic_> developer904:  don't know if there is any need to bind an event on both focus and click if that what you want to do check the api pages for on?
[09:29:45] <laravelnewbie> shoky right now I have a for (var i in array)
[09:29:51] <shoky> laravelnewbie: Object.keys(obj).forEach(key => { console.log(key, obj[key]) })
[09:30:06] <FilipNortic_> hmm don't know why i put in the questionmark there...
[09:30:06] <laravelnewbie> that's ugly, isn't it?
[09:30:09] <shoky> laravelnewbie: no.
[09:30:13] <shoky> for loops are ugly :)
[09:30:23] <laravelnewbie> hmm
[09:30:31] <laravelnewbie> only way to get the key?
[09:30:33] <shoky> in any case, that's how you properly do it in js
[09:30:50] <shoky> laravelnewbie: well you can use a for loop if you really want..
[09:30:51] <developer904> FilipNortic_ no there’s not. I just need a dialog box to pop up when the link ID is clicked
[09:31:03] <shoky> laravelnewbie:  for (var key in obj) { ... }
[09:31:19] <FilipNortic_> ok then just use .click(function()...
[09:33:03] <Xatenev> im fucking done
[09:33:05] <Xatenev> jspdf is so bad
[09:33:07] <Xatenev> >(
[09:33:20] <AdamPDotty> calling an array obj ...
[09:33:59] <developer904> Thank you FilipNortic_
[09:34:01] <shoky> php speak
[09:34:41] <AdamPDotty> anyway laravelnewbie: Whatever you do with "arrays" and loops, test it! There are some unexpected behaviours built-in
[09:51:43] <Xatenev> shoky: Did you use JSPDF ever? :((
[10:08:13] <shoky> Xatenev don't think so
[10:43:40] <v0lksman> I am trying to bind a click function to html inserted with a replacewith on an ajax call:  https://dpaste.de/Jq2s
[10:44:18] <v0lksman> doesn't seem to work.  any pointers?  should I be using .live('click') instead?  I only want to bind to the new HTML not any existing
[10:46:06] <morlenxus> Hey, currently the bryces can't be changed in size. Would that patch be ok as a temporary solution? https://omicron.homeip.net/filedump/e_bryce.c_patch
[10:46:38] <shoky> v0lksman: the docs for .replaceWith say that it returns the _removed_ elements
[10:47:45] <v0lksman> shoky: damn SO
[10:47:55] <shoky> v0lksman: read docs, not SO :)
[10:48:30] <v0lksman> shoky: can I use data since that is the HTML being returned from the ajax call?
[10:49:32] <shoky> v0lksman: data is an html string, it's not the DOM elements you created. you can do:  var $data = $(data);  button.replaceWith($data);   $data.find('.release_transportation').click(...)
[10:52:20] <v0lksman> shoky: thanks a bunch!  seems to work :)
[10:53:07] <shoky> morlenxus: wrong channel? :)
[10:54:28] <rayfun_> hi, I'm trying to assign the value of one input field to another input field, this doesn't seem to do the trick. thanks for any hints in advance:
[10:54:29] <rayfun_> parentContainer.find("input[name=AddressForm_FirstName]").val(parentContainer.find("input[name=ChangedAddress_FirstName]").val());
[10:55:54] <shoky> rayfun_: that should work fine if the selectors are correct and those elements exist under parentContainer
[10:56:16] <rayfun_> shoky, ok, then I'll check everything again, thanks
[10:58:05] <Sean24> hi
[10:58:33] <Sean24> shoky, the tamer of the jquery, are you around? i might even have to paypal you some $$$
[10:59:46] <shoky> Sean24 yeah but i'm going to buy something at a shop now. will be back in an hour or less probably
[11:00:17] <shoky> but ask the channel, other people can help too
[11:01:00] <Sean24> cool np. i know.
[11:01:24] <Sean24> so i am working on a svg graphic editor (pretty slugish and rudimental) and i have come up with this until now( it's a school project,i 'm a noob) http://fiddle.jshell.net/c608jp8x/1/
[11:01:56] <Sean24> now. if i draw a shape it is ok. but if i try drawing the 2nd one it will also draw all the other shapes i've drawn before
[11:03:05] <Sean24> i.e drawing a circle works fine. selecting a rectangle will lead to a circle enclosed in a rectangle instead of a rectangle
[11:03:39] <Sean24> drawing a line will lead to a line crossing a rectangle with a circle enclosed on it
[11:03:55] <Sean24> this is not bueno
[11:16:57] <morlenxus> shoky: Lol, sorry :)
[11:25:34] <Popzi> ugh, anyone got any experience with DataTables?
[11:35:20] <Popzi> [JQuery / Datatables] - https://paste.pound-python.org/show/a7yvVftq90Os4mS6bUfk/ anyone got any idea what's going on here? ajax is 200, I can't figure this out for the life of me :(
[11:44:18] <shoky> Sean24: you're adding an event listener inside an event listener - that's usually a bad idea. you should store in some variable the current user choice of shape, and have the shape-drawing event handlers outside of the button click handler, and in the shape-handlers you check that variable
[11:44:37] <shoky> Sean24: and based on the user choice in that variable, you draw the required shape
[11:44:52] <shoky> Sean24: otherwise you're just adding more and more event listeners
[11:51:08] <shoky> Sean24: well you're already doing the second part of what i said.  basically just move the drawing event handlers outside the button click handler. and move the current shape choice outside too
[11:53:30] <shoky> Popzi: you're setting the "ajax" option to an html string. i doubt you can do that.. where do you see that in datatables example/docs?
[11:53:55] <Popzi> shoky: it's okay I've sorted it now ;) didn't even need the ajax option haha, thank you! :)
[11:54:01] <shoky> Popzi: i'd imagine the whole point of datatables having an ajax option is that it does the ajax request for you, not you doing it yourself
[11:54:09] <shoky> heh k
[11:55:24] <shoky> Sean24: tho it's kinda neat to have all the shapes together :S
[11:58:23] <Popzi> my python ajax response ends in ]]    is it possible to make it ]];   in jquery?
[11:59:14] <shoky> uhh what?
[12:00:39] <Popzi> shoky: jquery does an ajax request, python responds with  [["something", "like"], ["this", "kk"]]  and I feed that into DataTables as it's data, however it comes up with the error 'request unknown' so I think my python response needs an ; on the end
[12:02:27] <shoky> Popzi: that makes no sense at all.. i highly doubt datatables wants a ; there
[12:03:01] <shoky> Popzi: but uh.. if you have a string, you can add any character to it with +   no need for jquery :)
[12:04:28] <Popzi> oh nvm ; isnt the problem lol, shoky, something else :)
[12:18:33] <bobs> hi is there any way to do sort for json object?
[12:38:40] <ahoo> what could be a reason for .click() not working on an anchor?
[12:39:08] <ahoo> see http://aliexpress.com
[12:39:21] <ahoo> jQuery('a[data-role="sign-link"]:contains("Sign in"):visible').click()
[12:39:25] <ahoo> doesn't do shit
[12:41:30] <ahoo> interestingly $('a')[33].click() works
[12:41:52] <ahoo> (not only on the dom node)
[12:46:08] <taplar> [33] gets you the dom node
[12:48:22] <ahoo> yeah
[12:48:35] <ahoo> i said that because it doesn't work either on the dom node nor the jquery object
[12:48:46] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[12:48:48] <ahoo> anyway i got it fixed
[12:48:51] <ahoo> thx anyway
[13:13:58] <z1haze_work> is it possible to navigate up and down through li's with a keyboard?
[13:15:25] <taplar> i'd think so
[13:15:44] <z1haze_work> how would I do it?
[13:16:24] <z1haze_work> the suggestive search right here http://www.coldwatercreek.com/ needs to have key up/key down navigation on the suggested results
[13:16:41] <taplar> i'm imagining a class on the active li, on up or down you'd find it and then use next()/prev() to find the one to go to
[13:29:46] <wrinkledcheese> My on('change',...) events don't have a which
[13:31:58] <wrinkledcheese> What if that thing I said
[13:33:13] <wrinkledcheese> OOps
[13:57:13] <z1haze_work> is there a way to ignore a certain element when using childrren and eq()
[13:57:42] <z1haze_work> like i need to use children() but ignoring the first child
[14:00:52] <shoky> .children().not(':first') works
[14:03:41] <whoised> hey guys, looking for some help here, can't seem to get the click to work properly. Trying to open the clicked item, while closing the current open one. https://jsfiddle.net/urpy0g9w/1/
[14:05:50] <shoky> whoised: `this` inside the click handler is the clicked element (i.e. the header), not the section-wrap
[14:06:27] <shoky> whoised: you want to remove the .each() around it, and in the click handler use $(this).closest('.section-wrap')
[14:07:18] <shoky> whoised: and you shouldnt be using .css('display')  to check , just use .hasClass  or you can shorten the whole thing probably with .toggleClass
[14:07:56] <shoky> and don't use two classes for the purpose of one :p  just 'open'  is enough
[14:08:01] <shoky> lack of 'open' means closed ;p
[14:10:28] <shoky> whoised: like this.. https://jsfiddle.net/urpy0g9w/2/   i'll leave to you the closing the current open one.
[14:13:31] <whoised> shoky: that's the current functionality, where I'm completely lost is closing the current open one. What I
[14:14:10] <whoised> What I'm confused about is how do I find out if there is another div open, and toggle that class if it is. The reason you saw the each() function
[14:27:25] <MikeD_> close everything open the one you want open ?
[14:28:04] <MikeD_> or store which one is open and use that piece of knowledge to do something smarter than "close all, open one"
[14:46:46] <WhirledPress> why is can I add methods to a jquery instance that use "this" to call jquery methods, but if I try to do a click handler, the reference to "this" is messed up?
[14:47:08] <vacho_> for some reason, when my popover gets trigged, it moves the next element. I just want my popover to lay over my elements. Any idea why this is happening? https://www.dropbox.com/s/p9c67hq7416o54f/Screenshot%202017-01-09%2011.46.39.png?dl=0
[14:47:19] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tp9rqdes/
[14:48:06] <WhirledPress> vacho__ sounds like a #css issue, really.
[14:49:04] <WhirledPress> try setting your position: property on the popup element to absolute and clear floats, that might solve it.
[14:50:45] <vacho_> WhirledPress: ok I will try that
[14:57:26] <pyCasso> Greetings. Is it possible to pass a call back function to a click event callback function?
[14:57:34] <pyCasso> using javascript here is a fiddle I created https://jsfiddle.net/moaykqfe/
[14:58:16] <pyCasso> just curious if I can have dynamic callbacks versus hardcoded function
[14:59:15] <whoised> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/urpy0g9w/4/
[15:15:19] <rjCousineau> Hello, I have a <div id="results"> i'm loading a form into via ajax.   now i'm trying $('#scan_machine').on('submit','#results',function(e){}) to capture the form's submit event, but its not working.. am I using on() correctly?
[15:17:47] <rjCousineau> oh nm. i see my error. I had the two event and handler mixed up
[15:23:25] <Bizkit> how do you save property accessors to a variable and call them from that variable on an object?
[15:26:08] <Bizkit> (can you even do that?)
[15:26:19] <taplar> wut?
[15:29:00] <rjCousineau> are you talking about dynamic variable names?
[15:29:35] <Bizkit> so lets say i have an var object = {key1: {key2: {key3: 3}}}; to get the key3 value you'd do object.key1.key2.key3, now i want to do something like var propacces = key1.key2.key3 and call that on the object like object.propacces
[15:30:10] <whoised> shoky: so what I have is some what working, but it hide the divs sometimes
[15:31:00] <taplar> Bizkit: uh, if i follow you, then no
[15:31:10] <taplar> or well
[15:31:43] <taplar> you can store var x = object.key1.key.key3 and then do x.somechildofkey3, sure
[15:33:03] <Bizkit> taplar the problem is that i need to keep the actual access reference and be able to add to it (at least thats what i want to do)
[15:33:54] <taplar> it is
[15:34:21] <taplar> if you do var x = { a: { b: {} } }; var y = x.a.b;  y.c = 'hi';
[15:34:29] <taplar> c will exist in x and y
[15:34:48] <taplar> since both x.a.b and y both point to the same object
[15:35:11] <whoised> taplar - https://jsfiddle.net/urpy0g9w/4/ i'm seeing issues where the divs just hide completely and I can't get them back. Is there an issue with my code somewhere?
[15:35:49] <taplar> what do you mean hide completely?
[15:38:53] <Bizkit> tamplar ah jeah sure but i loose the relation to the inital object, so if i had obj = {key1: {key2: {key3: "foo"}}}; var propacc = obj.key1.key2; and did propacc.key3 = "bar"; the value of key3 in obj wouldn't change
[15:44:52] <whoised> taplar: it hides the child div, so even if I click on the header, it won't load anymore
[15:46:22] <taplar> i'm not getting that to happen.  how are you doing that?
[15:51:57] <qakhan> hi all, i am creting a table through Jquery, i can create a table. i also want to select the created table and remove rows from it. as you can see there are already 2 table created and i can select them and remove rows from them.
[15:52:19] <qakhan> but when i can table via jquery i cannot select the table. here is my code https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/26/
[15:52:56] <whoised> taplar is it ok if I msg you url and the code to drop into console? It's pretty much the same thing, just with the correct selectors
[15:53:32] <taplar> so are you saying that it is not happening in the fiddle?
[15:54:23] <whoised> i tried to get it to replicate in the fiddle
[15:54:28] <whoised> but it wasn't working
[15:54:53] <taplar> qakhan: you can't repeat ids dude.  it's invalid markup
[15:55:21] <Bizkit> basically never use ids
[15:55:33] <Deusdeorum> yo, is there no override class or something? I know I can do removeClass().addClass() but seems weird
[15:57:24] <qakhan> taplar which ids are you point out?
[15:57:32] <taplar> selectgroupname
[15:57:35] <qakhan> id="selectgroupname"
[15:57:45] <taplar> yep
[15:57:49] <taplar> it's repeated in the html
[15:58:37] <Sean24> shoky: my connection dropped before i had the chance to thank you
[16:01:33] <whoised> taplar: yea I can't replicate the issue in fiddle
[16:01:36] <whoised> ...
[16:03:23] <qakhan> taplar each table is in its own div
[16:03:45] <taplar> doesn't matter.  ids are expected to be unique per page
[16:04:01] <taplar> they are unique ids
[16:04:28] <qakhan> but how they are working with first 2 tables?
[16:04:34] <qakhan> just curious
[16:04:55] <taplar> your browser will not blow up, however you will have issues with javascript trying to interact with them if you are going to want to look them up by id
[16:05:24] <taplar> any identifier that repeats should be a class instead of an id
[16:06:09] <qakhan> ok so can i have multiple classed in an element?
[16:06:09] <Sean24> hi gents. i was wondering - what function should i use or how can i implement a textbox in a svg - jquery editor? i.e - same attributes as the 'add text' function in mspaint?
[16:06:14] <taplar> yes
[16:06:40] <qakhan> and should i just change id="selectgroupname" to class=selectgroupname"
[16:06:48] <taplar> go for it
[16:06:59] <qakhan> thanks let me try
[16:07:28] <whoised> taplar - is it ok if I message you the link + snippet?
[16:15:36] <qakhan> taplar i have chaged ids to class but still not working.  https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/33/
[16:17:08] <taplar> i'm pretty busy right now.  can't participate much
[16:23:44] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[16:25:25] <whoised> duch_kazatel - I'm having an issue but fiddle isn't really letting me replicate the issue. Can I msg you the URL and the snippet I want used in the console + the fiddle I have of how I want it to work?
[16:25:45] <duch_kazatel> why PM it?
[16:25:53] <duch_kazatel> why not toss it out to the channel?
[16:26:58] <duch_kazatel> also you're including jquery twice in that fiddle.
[16:27:52] <whoised> ton of people here and don't want to break my nda that I'm working on ux/ui with them - easier if a few people look
[16:28:17] <duch_kazatel> lol anybody you PM could have their logs publicly available fwiw.
[16:28:39] <whoised> hm
[16:28:49] <duch_kazatel> either way - fwiw -   $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().children().find('#allgroupsdiv') - chaining parent like that's... a bit excessive.
[16:29:14] <whoised> https://jsfiddle.net/urpy0g9w/5/ - this is the fiddle
[16:29:19] <Sean24> duch_kazatel: type my name when you got a moment please. i don't want to interfere
[16:29:28] <Sean24> (so i can notice you have a sec)
[16:29:28] <whoised> the issue is when you click on header the child divs disappear
[16:29:41] <whoised> while the fiddle doesn't show it, the actual page does
[16:29:45] <duch_kazatel> Sean24 you're not interfering... but just put your question out to the channel.
[16:29:57] <qakhan> duch_kazatel can you please look at my fiddle
[16:30:05] <qakhan> https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/33/
[16:30:59] <Sean24> i need to implement a svg + jquery live textbox (the sort of thing you use in photoshop/mspaint to add text) and i'm not sure what i should use. it's not urgent as i'm still snooping around trying to figure it out myself but if you can give me some pointers it'd be highly appreciated
[16:31:24] <duch_kazatel> Sean24 well your first mistake is trying to combine SVG and jQuery - jquery speaks DOM, not SVG.
[16:31:42] <Sean24> i know duch_kazatel , shoky  already pointed that
[16:31:57] <duch_kazatel> erm, then why ask again?
[16:31:59] <Sean24> but it's a school assignment and since my professor owns my soul
[16:32:10] <duch_kazatel> "hey these two things don'
[16:32:13] <Sean24> and the requirements are as i said and i triple checked
[16:32:24] <duch_kazatel> then get a jquery plugin for handlign svg.
[16:32:31] <duch_kazatel> but that's pretty monumentally dumb.
[16:32:40] <Sean24> he might be the CS equivalent of Homer Simpson but sadly i can't do anything haha
[16:33:07] <duch_kazatel> whoised so what's the problem you're having?
[16:33:37] <duch_kazatel> qakhan you really need to fix up your dom lookups buddy
[16:34:13] <whoised> duch_kazatel - http://www.swapalease.com/lease/search.aspx if you go here and drop the jquery that is in the snippet with the console, the child divs disappear instead
[16:34:31] <qakhan> duch_kazatel can you please point out the problem
[16:34:40] <duch_kazatel> whoised then that page and the fiddle are different (Shrug)
[16:34:59] <duch_kazatel> qakhan for instance, chaining .parent() a whole bunch is generally not a good thing to do.
[16:35:29] <duch_kazatel> also, $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().children().find('#allgroupsdiv') - just need to do $('#allgroupsdiv') instead.
[16:35:50] <qakhan> duch_kazatel that was for testing i was actually using $('div #allgroupsdiv')
[16:35:53] <whoised> but how can it be different, the html in the fiddle are the same exact in the page, I'm pretty much using only that section with my code
[16:36:06] <duch_kazatel> qakhan only ever do the ID - don't prepend it with anything.
[16:36:18] <duch_kazatel> whoised you said it behaves differently between the two, right?
[16:37:12] <qakhan> so should i not use $('#allgroupsdiv') with append?
[16:37:19] <whoised> yes it does
[16:37:58] <whoised> alright well ill see what i find
[16:38:12] <helpmeplz> I'm trying to add/remove the in class on my items when they are selected from the dropdown.  However it's not removing the in and I can't figure out why.  https://jsfiddle.net/h4pj4you/
[16:45:00] <whoised> duch_kazatel, if I applied the code in the console, is it suppose to make the child divs disappear?
[16:51:17] <duch_kazatel> whoised sorry, i'm bouncing around - it's really hard to help when you don't have an isolated test case to work against.
[16:51:58] <duch_kazatel> qakhan you can append to $('#allgroupsdiv'), but you don';t need to do like $('div #allgroupsdiv').  no need to.
[16:53:07] <qakhan> ok, but how can i fix the issue.
[16:53:43] <duch_kazatel> qakhan what was the specific issue you were having again?  that the headings weren't all workign correctly, right?
[16:54:16] <whoised> Well, I'm trying to show you the issue exactly - while the fiddle shows the usability that I want, if you went ahead and paste that code in the console, you'd see that the usability is gone. But I'm positive it is due to my code hiding all the child divs instantly. I just can't see where I'm going wrong after.
[16:55:43] <duch_kazatel> whoised right, so if you want help here ytou really need to make an isolated test case showing your problem - otherwise we have to develop enoigh familiarity with your site/code to understand all the stuff in play to try to make things work right.
[16:55:56] <duch_kazatel> sometimes we can get lucky and spot the issue quickly, other times we can';t.
[16:56:00] <qakhan> first 2 table heading are working fine, when i create new table by clicking Create Group button. i cannot select newly created table heading and remove rows
[16:57:08] <duch_kazatel> qakhan because $('div .selectgroupname').on('click', function() { isn't delegated - you're only binding to trhe ones that exist on pageload.
[16:58:07] <qakhan> how can i delegate it to newly created tables?
[16:59:49] <whoised> K thanks duch
[16:59:53] <whoised> that helps actually
[17:05:15] <duch_kazatel> qakhan you... don't?
[17:05:23] <duch_kazatel> qakhan do you know how delegated listeners work?
[17:56:32] <Sean24> duch_kazatel: you around?
[17:58:03] <duch_kazatel> si
[17:58:55] <Sean24> how do i use jquery to retrieve text from a textbox and place it into a variable that can be read later?
[17:59:19] <duch_kazatel> like <input type="text">?
[18:00:03] <Sean24> i.e - http://jsfiddle.net/40c29o0o/6/
[18:00:08] <Sean24> the textbox i've added
[18:00:12] <Sean24> i've added an alert to it
[18:00:17] <Sean24> but it returns nothing
[18:00:41] <duch_kazatel> what alert?
[18:01:30] <duch_kazatel> oh, and it's not .value() - it's .val()
[18:01:46] <duch_kazatel> familiar at all with your dev tools?
[18:01:51] <duch_kazatel> in your browser, i mean
[18:02:23] <Sean24> sorry
[18:02:25] <Sean24> http://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/8/
[18:02:29] <Sean24> this was the fiddle i wanted to paste
[18:02:38] <Sean24> i forgot to update it
[18:03:13] <duch_kazatel> it's .val()
[18:03:21] <duch_kazatel> .text() is for non-input elements.
[18:03:31] <duch_kazatel> that value won't update with the input though
[18:06:26] <Sean24> i'm not sure i understand (i'm a beginner)
[18:06:42] <duch_kazatel> so try using .val() instead of .text() like you have there.
[18:07:07] <Sean24> i did
[18:07:12] <duch_kazatel> and what happened?
[18:07:17] <Sean24> still nothing
[18:07:30] <Sean24> http://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/9/
[18:07:55] <Sean24> the alert is blank instead of reading the value
[18:08:01] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:08:01] <Sean24> displaying it i mean
[18:08:02] <duch_kazatel> stop
[18:08:16] <duch_kazatel> are you doing this with a textarea or an input type="text"
[18:08:21] <duch_kazatel> you keep changing things around.
[18:08:32] <Sean24> textarea
[18:08:35] <Sean24> i stopped
[18:08:51] <Sean24> i keep mingling because i keep trying ways. sorry
[18:09:10] <duch_kazatel> which is totally fine!  you're just changing more than one thing at a time.
[18:09:20] <duch_kazatel> hard to help when you keep changing the requirements like that.
[18:09:59] <Sean24> sorry
[18:10:16] <duch_kazatel> here: let's simplify it down -> https://jsfiddle.net/t7onwemo/
[18:10:51] <duch_kazatel> now, in your version, you do var text = $("#txtArea").val(); once, right?
[18:11:18] <duch_kazatel> it'll store than and never update.  so instead of doing that, you want to juse use $("#txtArea").val(); wherever you want the text.
[18:16:12] <Sean24> makes sense
[18:16:13] <Sean24> let me try
[18:18:42] <Sean24> works like a charm!
[18:19:42] <Sean24> thanks for this
[18:19:55] <duch_kazatel> if you want to store something in a var, store the jquery object instead - var $theInput = $('#whateverThatIDWas');
[18:20:01] <duch_kazatel> then $theInput.val()
[18:20:08] <cannap> cache :P
[18:20:14] <Sean24> now back to the drawing board and google trying to figure out how to insert text in svg with javascript
[18:20:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah, some people call that "caching the selector"
[18:20:32] <cannap> when i use multiple times
[18:20:36] <cannap> then i do this
[18:21:02] <Sean24> my mental cache is limited to 8bytes
[18:21:04] <cannap> because browser know aha this one and dont need to crawle the dome again
[18:21:15] <cannap> dom*
[18:21:32] <duch_kazatel> cannap fwiw ID selectors are crazy fast so you may or may not actually see any performance benefit out of that.
[18:22:17] <qakhan> duch_kazatel i dont know. i am new to html and jquery
[18:22:18] <cannap> dont know but when i use multiple times more than 2 then i do this
[18:22:20] <cannap> dont know why
[18:22:57] <duch_kazatel> qakhan lucky for you there's this: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[18:24:29] <duch_kazatel> qakhan also this: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:24:41] <duch_kazatel> and don't just skip to the examples.
[18:24:53] <cannap> ^^
[18:25:03] <duch_kazatel> people make that mistake all the time.
[18:25:09] <cannap> i do
[18:25:14] <cannap> i  skip whole docs
[18:25:18] <cannap> and go to stackoverflow
[18:25:41] <Sean24> duch_kazatel: do i need to use paths while trying to insert text in svg with jquery? what should be my approach?
[18:25:58] <duch_kazatel> " trying to insert text in svg with
[18:25:58] <qakhan> duch_kazatel thanks , i will read them
[18:25:58] <duch_kazatel> jquery
[18:26:00] <duch_kazatel> woops
[18:26:15] <duch_kazatel> Sean24 "trying to insert text in svg with jquery" is the problem.
[18:26:52] <Sean24> it's what i was told by someone around here that i should to
[18:27:05] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:27:12] <Sean24> i now want to add a textbox (so basically the same thing you get in photoshop or microsoft paint or basically any graphical editor i suppose) which can be edited live and it's properties altered (exactly as in paint. i.e - text is in a rectangle, i need to be able to move it on the canvas, resize it when resizing the rectangle, etc)
[18:27:15] <Sean24> this is my 'task'
[18:27:17] <Sean24> right?
[18:27:27] <Sean24> and someone advised that my approach should be this one
[18:27:35] <duch_kazatel> then what's the question?
[18:27:53] <duch_kazatel> if you already know how to do it, why ask?
[18:28:32] <Sean24> i don't! if i knew i'd already be sleeping since it's 4 am where i live
[18:29:06] <duch_kazatel> okay, so then why are you refuting my response?
[18:29:15] <Sean24> i'm totally not my man
[18:29:16] <duch_kazatel> just use javascript to do it.
[18:30:59] <Sean24> i understand
[18:31:18] <Sean24> i will as soon as i figure out how
[18:31:47] <duch_kazatel> you might be able to select the path node or w/e
[18:31:50] <duch_kazatel> but ymmv
[18:52:44] <Guest89539> hi guys, I've a problem with webpack and jquery ui :/
[18:53:41] <Guest89539> if(jQuery.ui) { console.log(jQuery.ui) } return to me ie : false mouse : ( options, element ) sortable : ( options, element ) version : "1.12.1"
[18:53:58] <Guest89539> but Uncaught TypeError: $(...).sortable(...).disableSelection is not a function
[18:55:05] <qakhan> duch_kazatel and taplar thank you so much, you helped me alot
[18:57:07] <Guest89539> some one can help me ?
[18:58:46] <Woet> Guest89539: "Disabling text selection is bad. Don't use this."
[19:00:31] <Guest89539> @Woet ok i just remove it. Can you explain me why ? I need to disable text by css?
[19:00:49] <Woet> Guest89539: can you explain why you want to disable it?
[19:00:53] <duch_kazatel> ^^

[19:05:54] <Guest89539>  deprecated: 1.9.disableSelection() i see !
[19:06:09] <Guest89539> thx for the help
[21:57:47] <oxfouzer> Im not sure what im looking for, but a few hours of googling various things hasn't yielded any results....
[21:58:41] <oxfouzer> Does jquery have any built in or semi-built in templating functions? I'm thinking like... I want to display the users name after an async login call...
[21:59:18] <oxfouzer> right now I'm using somethign like $(".lbl_username").text(asyncResult.user.username); which works exactly as expected... just wondering if thats the common solution?
[22:05:04] <solice> oxfouzer no jquery doesnt have a templating engine, other than altering dom elements
[22:05:11] <solice> you want to use something like http://handlebarsjs.com/
