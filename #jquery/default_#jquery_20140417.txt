[00:07:28] <simpleuser> Hi there. I‚Äôm looking for how to reproduce an effect found of this website (great website and great music band by the way) https://www.figures-in-motion.com/ . I‚Äôm talking about the simple effect of reducing the image when scrolling down.
[00:08:07] <simpleuser> I‚Äôd like to do the same thing with a div with background. But obviously, it does not work as I want.
[00:08:23] <simpleuser> http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/
[00:18:12] <Cork> simpleuser: http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/1/
[00:22:43] <simpleuser> Cork: Amazing!¬†Thank you so much :)
[00:23:42] <Cork> simpleuser: you might want to use -webkit-transform too
[00:23:52] <Cork> to add some extra webkit version support
[00:24:56] <simpleuser> Cork: Like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/2/
[00:26:11] <Cork> simpleuser: http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/3/
[00:26:18] <Cork> but yes your solution works too
[00:28:04] <simpleuser> Ok, great, thanks :)
[00:44:58] <hellothere> hey there anyone knows anything similar to datatables ?
[00:45:08] <hellothere> i want a nice way to present forum and categories on my backend
[00:45:15] <hellothere> calling em with an ajax request
[00:48:23] <simpleuser> Another question: I‚Äôd like my div to "stay" a little while scrolling, like on figures-in-motion.com. I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/4/ but it does not work
[00:48:43] <simpleuser> I don‚Äôt understand why my if is not catched
[00:49:43] <hellothere> simpleuser: i guess add an interval time ?
[00:50:01] <simpleuser> hellothere: What do you mean ?
[00:51:01] <hellothere> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081443/run-a-function-in-time-interval-in-jquery
[00:51:19] <hellothere> insert that interval in the function that makes it smaller
[00:51:30] <hellothere> set it to like 1000 which is 1 second or whatever u want
[00:51:42] <hellothere> after that time the function is gonna start running
[00:51:47] <hellothere> and ur div is gonna become smaller
[00:52:34] <simpleuser> Yeah but i don‚Äôt want it to be linked to time. Only to scroll status
[00:53:39] <simpleuser> look at my jsfiddle (or figures-in-motion.com )
[00:53:43] <hellothere> then you can play with delay()
[00:54:32] <simpleuser> Why¬†?
[00:54:47] <hellothere> oh i get what u mean
[00:54:51] <hellothere> gimme a second
[00:55:00] <simpleuser> Ok :)
[00:56:29] <hellothere> simpleuser: u need to use .parallax
[00:56:33] <hellothere> that will make your life easier
[00:56:40] <hellothere> and will do exactly what you want
[00:56:40] <hellothere> :)
[00:57:32] <hellothere> on the site you gave me the user is having a difficulty scrolling down cause there is no parallax inserted
[00:57:49] <hellothere> once u nest a paralax user will be able to scroll down while u make that rock thing slower
[00:57:53] <hellothere> smaller*
[00:58:58] <simpleuser> Oh ok. I‚Äôm gonna check that
[00:59:03] <simpleuser> Thanks hellothere :)
[00:59:34] <Cork> simpleuser: you mean something like http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/5/ ?
[01:00:05] <Cork> or maybe even
[01:00:06] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/6/
[01:01:03] <simpleuser> Exactly Cork ! Thank you so much ! \o/
[01:03:14] <Cork> simpleuser: and here is a better solution http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/7/
[01:03:22] <Cork> it moves the style rules out of js
[01:03:28] <Cork> (except for the dynamic ones)
[01:04:20] <zagaza`> hmm so my website works in chrome but not in chrome canary.. I get some Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function. Can someone please help me figure out what's wrong? http://danielnikolovski.com
[01:04:29] <surfer190> Goodday, I am having an issue with an element I have given a `.click' to however the element is being replaced with ajax so the event is only caled once. Any suggestions?
[01:05:33] <EdwardIII> hey, is there a way to block jQuery plugins (e.g. datepickers, sexed-up dropdowns, select2, etc) from alterint .val()?
[01:05:45] <Cork> zagaza`: from firefox "TypeError: $colwrap.imagesLoaded is not a function"
[01:05:57] <simpleuser> Gonna check your new version. Thanks Cork ;)
[01:06:01] <Cork> zagaza`: and if you click the file link in chrome it points at the same place
[01:06:14] <Cork> simpleuser: it just fetches the height from the element instead of hardcoding it
[01:07:08] <simpleuser> Oh, great !
[01:07:40] <zagaza`> Cork: hmm thanks.. I'm pretty new to javascript but how is it not a function? :S
[01:07:59] <sledgeDJ> hi guysi have the issue i have this code to do FAQ. i want to modifiy it so if the first question is expanded to reveal answer and then second question is click the first answer closes back up before revealing the new answer. how should i modify this code...  http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/2/
[01:08:00] <sledgeDJ> thanks
[01:08:15] <Cork> zagaza`: it's a plugin and the plugin isn't loaded
[01:09:25] <zagaza`> yeah I know and it is being loaded, I see it in the console in chrome under network..
[01:10:37] <Cork> sledgeDJ: http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/3/
[01:10:47] <Cork> zagaza`: might be you load it too late
[01:11:05] <sledgeDJ> CorK: thanks a lot
[01:13:26] <zagaza`> Cork: how about now if you refresh, still same error in ff?
[01:13:48] <zagaza`> you're a genious, I loaded it too late and seems to work now :)
[01:13:59] <Cork> ya
[01:14:06] <zagaza`> awesome thanks
[01:14:17] <Cork> looks like you have a race condition
[01:14:25] <EdwardIII> i kinda want something like $el.on('thirtyparty.update', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); return false; });
[01:14:37] <Cork> zagaza`: if you need to load the script you load it too late
[01:14:46] <Cork> zagaza`: if it is in the browsers cache it works
[01:14:55] <Cork> zagaza`: so it looks like you still have a problem
[01:15:18] <zagaza`> hmm.. I'm not quite following now, the plugin or the init.js ?
[01:15:25] <Cork> EdwardIII: well you can if they fire one
[01:15:41] <Cork> zagaza`: most likely the plugin
[01:16:12] <EdwardIII> Cork: hrm i tried e.preventDefault(); and return false, both didn't stop the plugin from updating .val()
[01:16:30] <EdwardIII> in this instance i'm looking at https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker
[01:16:39] <Cork> EdwardIII: that would only work if the plugin listens for that
[01:16:59] <EdwardIII> i'm consuming this with knockout. i want the widget to show a UK date format (dd/mm/yyyy) but then when it updates, i want it to use YYYY-MM-DD
[01:16:59] <zagaza`> hmm.. so if you hard refresh it's not working?
[01:17:12] <EdwardIII> i can handle the updating, but the plugin is altering .val() first with the wrong format and it's breaking stuff
[01:18:19] <Cork> EdwardIII: as far as i can tell that plugin doesn't fire any thirdparty event
[01:18:28] <EdwardIII> sorry that was an example
[01:18:43] <Cork> or rather it doesn't look like it fires any events at all
[01:18:53] <EdwardIII> lemme paste some code
[01:19:04] <EdwardIII> Cork: sure, it's got a ton of events: http://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/release/events.html
[01:19:06] <Cork> (for update)
[01:19:13] <EdwardIII> there's a changeDate event
[01:20:14] <EdwardIII> Cork: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/e13a67b3e0d07234527f#file-bindings-js-L8
[01:20:36] <Cork> EdwardIII: ya, but it is blind events
[01:20:42] <EdwardIII> Cork: 'blind'?
[01:20:48] <Cork> it doesn't check what happens in them
[01:20:56] <Cork> it's kinda fire and forget
[01:21:29] <Cork> it fires changeYear and changeMonth when those are changed
[01:21:36] <EdwardIII> yeah
[01:21:36] <Cork> and then it checks if the value is in range
[01:21:42] <Cork> and does .val(formated).change()
[01:21:51] <EdwardIII> hrm there's no way i can override that then i guess
[01:21:53] <Cork> so there really isn't a way to override without modifying the plugin
[01:22:09] <Cork> you could patch setValue
[01:22:42] <EdwardIII> heh yeah i may do that
[01:22:45] <EdwardIII> monkey-patch kingdom
[01:23:11] * EdwardIII tries it
[01:23:25] <Cork> (function() { var oldSetValue = Datepicker.prototype.setValue; Datapicker.prototype.setValue = function() { /* fire event */ oldSetValue.apply(this, arguments); };
[01:23:35] <Cork> })();
[01:24:33] <shafox> where should be the promise  call in $.ajax ? here is the snippet for the $.ajax post request http://pastie.org/9087014
[01:25:01] <Cork> where it should be?
[01:25:25] <Cork> if you mean where to attach .done you tail it after the ajax call
[01:25:28] <shafox> should it be like $.ajax().done(function(data) { //code for data }); or $.ajax({success: function(data) { //code for data}); ?
[01:25:35] <Cork> }).done(function() {})
[01:25:40] <Cork> yes
[01:25:51] <shafox> both will work i guess ? Cork
[01:25:55] <Cork> yes
[01:25:59] <shafox> thanks
[01:26:07] <shafox> You are a gem
[01:26:27] <zagaza`> Cork: hmm you were right it's still not working properly :/
[01:26:39] <EdwardIII> Cork: hrm i'm wondering if i can access Datepicker, i'm shimming in that plugin with requirejs
[01:26:42] * EdwardIII tries it
[01:26:46] <Cork> zagaza`: ya, you have a proper race situation
[01:27:48] <zagaza`> that sounds like something bad
[01:28:14] <EdwardIII> hrm no Datepicker obj doesn't exist in that scope doesn't exist
[01:29:19] <EdwardIII> Cork: hmm can i do that work on $.fn.datepicker.prototype?
[01:30:13] <EdwardIII> mmm i tried it, no change
[01:30:22] <Cork> $.fn.datepicker.Constructor.prototype
[01:30:36] <Cork> sorry missed that the variable wasn't exposed
[01:30:51] <EdwardIII> Cork: ah awesome
[01:32:08] <zagaza`> Cork: what's a race situation? is it something that can be solved?
[01:32:42] <Cork> zagaza`: its when two thins process async; depend on each other
[01:32:53] <Cork> but doesn't wait for what they depend on to be ready
[01:33:09] <Cork> so if the first one takes too long the second one will run before the first one is done
[01:33:26] <EdwardIII> sounds like the perfect application for a nested promise
[01:33:29] <Cork> so its a race against time to get the first one ready before the second one fires
[01:33:34] <Cork> ya
[01:33:41] <zagaza`> hmm it sounds like this can be solved with requirejs shim? and set up a dependency for masonry that it depends on imagesLoaded?
[01:33:46] <Cork> zagaza`: the solution for those is to make the second one wait for the first one
[01:33:56] <Cork> zagaza`: yes
[01:34:04] <zagaza`> sweet gonna try
[01:36:19] <EdwardIII> heh damn, datepicker doesn't redraw the input box, so after all that, it turns out i do actually need it to change .val()
[01:36:30] <EdwardIII> would work for something like select2, but not this
[01:36:36] <Cork> lol
[01:36:58] * EdwardIII bangs head on desk
[01:37:10] <EdwardIII> i guess i'll just have to rewrite my PHP backend to read the uk date format
[01:37:15] <EdwardIII> not very robust
[01:37:26] <zagaza`> Cork: there we go, could you see if you get that error now? http://danielnikolovski.com/
[01:37:46] <Uhkis> EdwardIII: strtotime doesn't do the job?
[01:38:00] <Cork> ... ya
[01:38:07] <Cork> zagaza`: can still reproduce it
[01:38:07] <EdwardIII> Uhkis: strtotime can't tell the difference between dd/mm/yyyy and mm/dd/yyyy
[01:38:16] <EdwardIII> Uhkis: .... most of the time :)
[01:38:24] <Uhkis> ah, true
[01:38:24] <zagaza`> ://
[01:39:13] <EdwardIII> actually in my JS i should have a util, function processDateFromDatepickerWidget(date)...
[01:39:28] <Cork> zagaza`: if you check the network tab it still loads init.js before imageloaded.js
[01:39:32] <EdwardIII> i guess
[01:40:37] <Cork> zagaza`: also image loaded depends on imageloaded depends on jquery so your loading that in the wrong order too
[01:40:43] <Cork> uh...
[01:40:56] <Cork> zagaza`: *also imageloaded depends on jquery so your loading that in the wrong order too
[01:47:08] <zagaza`> Cork: yeah true, gonna try to fix it
[01:48:46] <zagaza`> the code seems to be right, but that shim thing isn't working for shits
[02:01:40] <koichirose> Hello. I have some inputs named ‚Äúdescriptions[$id][‚Äòname‚Äô]‚Äù. $id is a number. I don‚Äôt know how many of them each time. How do I cycle through them? Something like PHP‚Äôs foreach ($descriptions as $id => $value)
[02:03:36] <ServerCrash> this.panels.addClass("ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom"...
[02:03:46] <ServerCrash> TypeError: this.element.addClass(...).toggleClass(...).delegate is not a function
[02:03:52] <ServerCrash> using jquery.ui.tabs.min.js?ver=1.10.4
[02:04:09] <ServerCrash> any clues whats conflicting here
[02:04:49] <ServerCrash> using jquery.js?ver=1.11.0'
[02:04:59] <Cork> ServerCrash: sounds like your using a really old version of jquery? -- heh nope
[02:05:49] <Cork> ServerCrash: make sure you don't have another framework loaded
[02:06:01] <Cork> it might be your not using jquery there i guess...
[02:06:40] <Cork> koichirose: do those elements have a class or something?
[02:06:57] <Cork> as you can't really select based on that string
[02:07:09] <koichirose> Cork: no. I solved using the ‚Äòstarts with‚Äô selector. $("[name^='descriptions']")
[02:07:25] <koichirose> but then I still need to access the $id inside those
[02:08:21] <zagaza`> Cork: are they loading in the right order now? http://danielnikolovski.com/
[02:08:43] <zagaza`> I dont think you can reproduce the problem now
[02:09:56] <Cork> zagaza`: ya, can't break it anymore
[02:10:41] <zagaza`> awesome, thanks for the help
[02:10:50] <Cork> np
[02:11:03] <surfer190> Hi, I have a jquery event that fires when u click the headings of a table, it then sorts the table, removes the old one and replaces with an entirely new table. However when you click again the event does not fire. I am using .on() and it still does not work
[02:13:21] <Cork> surfer190: you need to use delegated event listeners
[02:13:32] <Cork> surfer190: i guess your coming from .live
[02:13:37] <Cork> and .on isn't a replacement
[02:13:44] <Cork> .on is a combination of .bind and .delegate
[02:13:55] <Cork> and you need to use the delegate syntax for .on
[02:14:04] <Cork> ?on
[02:14:13] <Cork> oh, right the bot is dead
[02:14:44] <Cork> surfer190: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[02:15:22] <zagaza`> Cork: lol wierd has hell though, the zoom-in animation when you click the images works in canary and firefox, but not in chrome wtf :/ is it working for you in chrome?
[02:17:00] <surfer190> thanks cork I will look into it and return
[02:30:20] <zagaza`> ah nvm fixed it, I thought chrome canary had webkit but apparently its blink
[02:31:01] <Cork> zagaza`: blink is basically webkit
[02:31:36] <zagaza`> yeah but css transform works in blink, not in webkit.. I had to do -webkit-transform for my chrome
[02:31:37] <Cork> blink is webkit with some old buggy features removed and some bugfixes
[02:32:13] <zagaza`> cool cool
[02:32:22] <BinaryKitten> http://www.chromium.org/blink
[02:33:16] <BinaryKitten> Vendor Prefixes
[02:33:16] <BinaryKitten> Historically, browsers have relied on vendor prefixes (e.g., -webkit-feature) to ship experimental features to web developers. This approach can be harmful to compatibility because web content comes to rely upon these vendor-prefixed names. Going forward, instead of enabling a feature by default with a vendor prefix, we will instead keep the (unprefixed) feature behind the ‚Äúenable experimental
[02:33:22] <BinaryKitten> web platform features‚Äù flag in about:flags until the feature is ready to be enabled by default. Mozilla has already embarked on a similar policy and the W3C CSS WG formed a rough consensus around a complementary policy.
[02:40:36] <surfer190> I am using: $("#enterprise-table thead tr").on("click", "th", function(event) {
[02:40:36] <surfer190>         console.log('hello');
[02:40:37] <surfer190>         var field = $(this).data('field');
[02:40:37] <surfer190>         setsort(field);
[02:40:37] <surfer190>     });
[02:41:02] <surfer190> setsort: causes the table to be replaced
[02:41:34] <surfer190> So it only works once, after the table reload, it doesn't
[02:41:55] <Cork> surfer190: if he table is replaced i suspect it replaces the tr too?
[02:42:06] <surfer190> correct
[02:42:14] <Cork> then you will still lose the event handler
[02:42:23] <Cork> you need to bind it on a static element
[02:42:27] <Cork> that isn't removed
[02:42:52] <surfer190> Ok so you are saying I should only return content below the tr
[02:45:13] <michelleglauser> Hi. I'm trying to get some pictures to display one by one, with the next appearing after a swipe has been made to the left or right. I can get the swipe working (http://jsfiddle.net/MichelleGlauser/CR329/1), but once I put the swipe inside of a loop, neither the swipe nor the loop work (http://jsfiddle.net/MichelleGlauser/CR329/4/). Could someone please take a look and help me?
[03:29:19] <koichirose> Hello, what is wrong with this code? http://pastie.org/9087207
[03:31:10] <prtksxna> koichirose: The console.log needs to be in a callback
[03:31:29] <prtksxna> koichirose: Sorry, didn't see line 8
[03:31:31] <koichirose> prtksxna: the second one?
[03:31:33] <koichirose> ok
[03:31:40] <prtksxna> koichirose: Call whatever you need to from the callback function
[03:31:41] <surfer190> thanks @cork for your earlier help
[03:32:06] <koichirose> prtksxna: what do you mean? I need deal which is either a new object or the result of $.get
[03:32:07] <prtksxna> koichirose: So if there is more stuff after line 13, put it in a function and call it from line 9
[03:32:15] <prtksxna> koichirose: Does that make sense?
[03:32:38] <koichirose> prtksxna: kind of. you mean return deal inside the if, inside the callback
[03:32:52] <koichirose> and call this new function after line 13?
[03:33:11] <koichirose> could work but I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs not working like this, since deal is defined outside of everything
[03:33:30] <prtksxna> koichirose: http://pastie.org/9087217
[03:33:45] <prtksxna> koichirose: You should also read about Deferreds
[03:34:01] <prtksxna> koichirose: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[03:34:10] <koichirose> prtksxna: got it, but I still don‚Äôt understand why my solution won‚Äôt work
[03:34:31] <prtksxna> koichirose: Because line13 executes before the ajax call has returned anything
[03:34:45] <Cork> koichirose: ajax is async, so the code keeps executing after you've made the ajax call
[03:34:50] <prtksxna> koichirose: Its asynchronous, so the rest of the code executes
[03:35:03] <Cork> the callback then fires out of order when ever the data comes back
[03:35:23] <prtksxna> koichirose: ^ ( Cork is typing faster :P )
[03:35:59] <koichirose> oops that‚Äôs right
[03:36:00] <koichirose> got it
[03:36:04] <Cork> but as javascript is single threaded it also means the callback can't ever fire before the current stack has unwind
[03:36:23] <Cork> so the success callback can't ever fire before the console.log line after the ajax call
[03:36:23] <prtksxna> koichirose: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4559032/easy-to-understand-definition-of-asynchronous-event might help
[03:45:11] <koichirose> right right I got it, I found myself dealing with the issue multiple times, I simply forgot :)
[03:49:49] <alex88_> hi guys, I'm trying to debugging jquery.event.move, why it's not firing events, the only things it does on initialization are binding no mousedown.move and touchstart.move https://github.com/stephband/jquery.event.move/blob/master/js/jquery.event.move.js#L568
[03:50:08] <alex88_> however, those events are new to me, how can it get touchstart events from that?
[03:50:40] <alex88_> in other pages I've seen it works fine without any other initialization, on our instead, touch* callback functions never gets called
[03:51:07] <BinaryKitten> alex88_ have you tried contacting the author?
[03:51:56] <alex88_> BinaryKitten: not yet, just asking if there's something I'm missing
[03:52:08] <alex88_> since I don't see any binding except those 2 and in other pages it works fine
[03:52:11] <BinaryKitten> generally it's someone's custom plugin code
[03:52:20] <BinaryKitten> only they'd be really able to answer properly
[03:52:41] <alex88_> if you check its readme https://github.com/stephband/jquery.event.move it automatically fires the move* events on the elements
[03:52:58] <alex88> without anything needed
[03:54:39] <alex88> it's just in our page those events aren't fired
[03:55:57] <BinaryKitten> you're going to need to create a fiddle of your code
[03:56:16] <BinaryKitten> we can't help with a plugin's but we might be able to help with where you're going wrong in your code
[03:56:27] <BinaryKitten> might being the oiperative word
[03:56:37] <alex88> BinaryKitten: I'll try to drill down and create a small test case
[03:56:58] <alex88> since it's a page from someone else I've to fix
[03:57:11] <alex88> worst thing to work on
[04:03:50] <alex88> on jsfiddle works
[04:04:03] <alex88> is there a way to check when an event is binded?
[04:27:24] <star_prone> hi
[04:29:21] <star_prone> I have a button on my page which has an event listner attach to onclick; on the button is clicked, a modal window created with jquery-ui will open and an ajax request will start. how can I pass the variable containing the ajax request to to modal cancel method in order to stop the ajax?
[04:54:38] <Sharcho> I'm using jQuery 1.11.0 (happens with 2.1.0) with Turbolinks, and I'm getting console errors when I try to use fadeToggle or slideToggle. Any idea how to fix it?
[04:54:47] <Sharcho> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[04:54:47] <Sharcho> jquery.js?body=1:6964 this.pos = eased = jQuery.easing[ this.easing ](
[04:56:04] <monk3y> Sharcho: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14483557/jquery-plugins-not-working-type-error-undefined-is-not-a-function  ?
[04:56:56] <seutje> sounds like  the easing function you are trying to use isn't defined
[05:02:33] <Sharcho> BRB
[05:28:33] <Macaveli> Can anyone take a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23133096/jquery-validate-file-after-filename-change-err-file-not-found
[05:28:50] <Sal> how can i get data-  from a <td> in the last <tr> of a table?
[05:31:03] <prtksxna> Sal: the :last-child pseudo selector might help - http://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/l/last-child/
[05:31:06] <ankurk_> Sal: $('#tableid tr:last td:nth-child(columnnumber)').attr('data')
[05:31:22] <decx> cmon ankurk_ you
[05:31:30] <decx> 're here long enough to know about context :>
[05:31:30] <Sal> ankurk_, !!! great!!!
[05:31:55] <ankurk_> decx: was that wrong? -___-
[05:32:14] <decx> a long tail selector is slower than defining context
[05:32:26] <decx> $('tr:last td','#tableid')
[05:32:43] <ankurk_> ahh :(
[05:32:57] <ankurk_> someday someday
[05:33:00] <prtksxna> decx: how is that different? :O
[05:33:00] <decx> hehe
[05:33:19] <prtksxna> plz2give link to relevant docs!
[05:33:24] <decx> prtksxna the selector starts checking from the right
[05:33:38] <prtksxna> oh
[05:33:40] <decx> so it's checking all tds first then narrowing it down
[05:33:53] <decx> if you define a context it finds the id #tableid first and goes from there
[05:34:08] <prtksxna> decx: And one can add as many of these?
[05:34:12] <decx> it's like $('#tableid').find('td')
[05:34:30] <decx> only one ^^
[05:34:57] <prtksxna> ah ok
[05:34:59] <prtksxna> decx: Thanks :)
[05:35:13] <decx> docs: https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery-selector-context
[05:36:27] <prtksxna> decx: Got it, thank you so much :)
[05:36:40] <prtksxna> I never knew it was reverse
[05:37:06] <decx> there's also a test on jsperf to see it in action http://jsperf.com/findvschildren/2
[05:37:46] <Sal> ankurk_, sorry, in was wrong, i need to get the data from the last <tr> with class .active. Is it: $('#tableid tr.active:last) ?
[05:38:09] <ankurk_> Sal, yep
[05:38:13] <Sal> thanks
[05:39:28] <axilaris> hi..u guys know whats wrong with this select2 + validationengine combination ? http://jsfiddle.net/VLHN8/89/   choose a select2 value and submit
[05:41:31] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to run this code, but not works. Any help? http://fiddle.jshell.net/s8nUh/165/
[05:49:15] <seutje> abailarri: the "edit" text is outside the <a> wrapper
[05:49:33] <seutje> the <a> wrapper essentially ends up as 0x0, and thus, unclickable
[05:50:21] <abailarri> seutje, http://fiddle.jshell.net/s8nUh/168/
[05:50:37] <seutje> also, ur toggleClass is useless as the inline style wins the specificity war
[05:51:17] <abailarri> yes
[05:51:18] <abailarri> http://fiddle.jshell.net/s8nUh/169/
[05:51:18] <seutje> so either move the display: none; to a class and toggle that, or set/unset it inline
[05:51:21] <abailarri> now works
[05:51:29] <seutje> \o/
[05:52:03] <seutje> should probably point out that it's usually better to have the selectors inside the click handler be relative to the this object inside of it
[05:52:20] <abailarri> aja ok now I change
[05:52:25] <seutje> that way one trigger won't fire on a possible multitude of elements
[05:52:46] <Sharcho> seutje, I loaded jquery.easing and I'm not getting that issue with Turbolinks anymore, thanks.
[05:52:53] <seutje> \o/
[05:53:12] <abailarri> one question. How can you see there is a div class  named label-desarrollo-web with a value Desarollo web
[05:53:22] <abailarri> is posible to get this value and put inside the input?
[05:53:34] <abailarri> when triggers click function?
[05:55:35] <seutje> sure, but regular elements don't have a "value", but rather, a text content
[05:55:49] <seutje> you can fetch it with .text()
[05:55:59] <sledgeDJ> i need some help modifiying this code... http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/3/  i want to make it so the when a question is click the browser scroll so the the h2 (the question) is lets say 50 pixels below top of browser window. can someone please help me with this?
[05:56:10] <TheWhisper> hey
[05:56:25] <TheWhisper> If I'm doing: 			var element = $('.content p a')
[05:56:25] <TheWhisper> 			console.log(element);
[05:56:34] <TheWhisper> and it returns this string in the console: [object Object]
[05:56:37] <TheWhisper> what does that mean?
[05:57:40] <seutje> abailarri: http://fiddle.jshell.net/s8nUh/170/ like that? also added a e.preventDefault(), as you are using a link with href "#", it tries to jump to that anchor... preventDefault() prevents that, obviously
[05:58:01] <seutje> TheWhisper: weird, was this in IE?
[05:58:05] <TheWhisper> FF
[05:58:30] <seutje> usually it'll show an expandible object instead of just casting it to a string, try using console.dir instead
[05:59:00] <TheWhisper> well, if I click that
[05:59:01] <TheWhisper> it shows
[05:59:06] <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/FbMTc3X.png
[05:59:08] <TheWhisper> in the console
[05:59:21] <seutje> oh lol, I guess that's how FF logs it nowadays, my bad
[05:59:56] <TheWhisper> hm
[06:00:01] <TheWhisper> Okay, it does return it then
[06:00:04] <TheWhisper> properly
[06:00:12] <sledgeDJ> did you guys understand or even see my question?
[06:00:59] <abailarri> seutje, yes, thanks
[06:01:27] <seutje> sledgeDJ: sure
[06:02:07] <sledgeDJ> seutje: Great. thanks for the response. do you think you can help me out with this one?
[06:02:34] <Moccodo> How do I add a tab dynamically? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2416547/how-to-add-and-remove-jquery-tabs-dynamically/2430311#2430311 does not work for me.
[06:02:38] <seutje> TheWhisper: basically, it'll show you the output of toString on whatever you passed in, for instance, try console.log({toString: function() {return 'lol'; }}); :P
[06:02:47] <TheWhisper> yeah, got it working
[06:04:58] <seutje> sledgeDJ: grab offsetTop of the h2, subtract your 50, and of it's over 0, just window.scrollTo it?
[06:05:26] <seutje> or rather offset().top
[06:05:34] <sledgeDJ> seutje: do u think u can show me in jsfiddle? i am new to this
[06:10:45] <seutje> sledgeDJ: http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/4/ like that? also cleaned up the selector repetition a bit
[06:11:16] <seutje> had it default to 0 when the scrolltop would be < 0
[06:18:18] <Moccodo> How do I add a tab dynamically? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2416547/how-to-add-and-remove-jquery-tabs-dynamically/2430311#2430311 does not work for me. My links are not rendered as tab-like buttons :(
[06:35:15] <blue_warlock> hi
[06:35:57] <blue_warlock> i have a simple ul  how do i select only the firsts <li> ?
[06:36:25] <blue_warlock> without selecting the sub <li> ?
[06:37:09] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: $('ul > li')
[06:37:24] <blue_warlock> <ul><li><ul id="sub"><li></li></ul></li></ul>
[06:37:33] <BillCriswell> If you have ul saved you can do like.. $ul.children('li') or $ul.find('> li');
[06:37:50] <blue_warlock> > li
[06:37:52] <blue_warlock> ?
[06:37:56] <fbernier> I've got a client who integrates a jQuery library of mine. This client has jQuery 1.2.6 on his website which is not compatible with my library. What is the easiest thing for me to suggest him?
[06:38:16] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: Yes.
[06:38:30] <blue_warlock> that will select only the firsts <li> without getting subs ?
[06:38:34] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[06:38:43] <blue_warlock> tks BillCriswell
[06:38:50] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:38:51] <Sal> does anyone know why this returned json "{data:[]}" gives me an ajax error with status 0   ??
[06:39:32] <blue_warlock> i wish to understand that kind of syntax
[06:39:46] <PhonicUK2> where I can do $("<div>", { text: "Hello World!" }); - inside that parameters object, can I also add things like {click: handler } ?
[06:40:05] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: It's just CSS.
[06:40:07] <blue_warlock> so if i want to select the 2nds <li>s   it is ul ul >li  ?
[06:40:47] <blue_warlock> yes i know its css but i dont know the use of >
[06:40:49] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: No. That would get all of them after the first level. You would need to do ul > li > ul > li.
[06:40:49] <Sal> it simply returns an empty array when infinite scrolling reaches the last records on tables, but the ajax call jumps to the error:
[06:41:06] <BillCriswell> salah: That's not valid JSON.
[06:41:16] <Sal> why?
[06:41:20] <PhonicUK2> yes I can :)
[06:41:23] <BillCriswell> data isn't quoted.
[06:41:39] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: There's a mess of selectors many don't know about in CSS.
[06:41:45] <Sal> wait, let me see again, maybe its me that didn't copy it correctly
[06:41:46] <BillCriswell> ~, +
[06:42:05] <blue_warlock> i know those
[06:42:15] <BillCriswell> Oh, but never seen > ?
[06:42:16] <blue_warlock> * = all
[06:42:26] <BillCriswell> I see > way more often than those two.
[06:42:34] <blue_warlock> , assign properties to a list
[06:42:54] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: Right.
[06:42:57] <blue_warlock> #id , .class, a:hover,
[06:43:11] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: I am not doubting you know CSS.
[06:43:12] <blue_warlock> that one ~ i dont know and >
[06:43:34] <blue_warlock> im gonna read something about ;)
[06:43:42] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK2: Did you try it?
[06:43:48] <PhonicUK2> BillCriswell, yes
[06:44:01] <PhonicUK2> just tried in jsfiddle quick, works fine
[06:44:05] <Sal> BillCriswell, my mistake, data is quoted: its {"data":[]}
[06:45:10] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK2: You have to do it through on: I think.
[06:45:28] <PhonicUK2> nop, just {click: handler} as is worked fine
[06:45:34] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK2: http://jsbin.com/bucojoni/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:45:47] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK2: Oh. Then there you go.
[06:47:13] <BillCriswell> Sal: I'd need to see a demo then.
[06:47:33] <Sal> it simply works for all previous pages
[06:47:57] <Sal> only when its on the end and it returns an empty array, it jumps to the ajax error:
[06:48:12] <Sal> now i'm trying to return a value like false
[06:48:25] <Sal> to see if something changes
[06:51:13] <Sal> BillCriswell, nothing to do with it, it still goes into error:
[06:51:35] <BillCriswell> Sal: Can you post the code you have at jsbin.com ?
[06:51:55] <BillCriswell> It's definitely valid JSON.
[06:53:33] <Sal> bill, it wont work there because of the missing server part
[06:55:32] <sledgeDJ> seutje: doesnt seem to be working at all
[06:56:56] <seutje> sledgeDJ: did you put it maximized so it no longer has a scrollbar?
[06:57:24] <sledgeDJ> seutje: it is not expanding answers when i click on questions
[06:58:50] <seutje> sledgeDJ: oh, lol... made a booboo refactoring that mess http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/5/
[06:59:02] <CrowX-> my university has a html5 app contest going on and I'm thinking of applying. Does anyone here perhaps have an idea on what kind of app I could participate with?
[06:59:17] <CrowX-> what would you find useful?
[06:59:33] <seutje> I aliased $(this).next('.answer') to $answer, but replaced one with $answer.next('.answer') by mistake :D
[06:59:48] <seutje> CrowX-: one that cures cancer
[06:59:58] <CrowX-> how didn't I think of it sooner
[07:00:00] <seutje> so I no longer have to slave over the website of cancer-related organisations
[07:00:00] <BillCriswell> CrowX-: What would your university beenfit from?
[07:00:44] <sledgeDJ> seutje: thanks it looks good now. i will test on my site and let u know
[07:00:57] <TheWhisper> any suggestion on how to add a class while resizing
[07:01:03] <TheWhisper> and then remove the class when I stop resizing?
[07:01:04] <CrowX-> BillCriswell, nothing that I could think of. Plus, the contest is sponsored by intel, so they might have a say in deciding the winners
[07:01:15] <CrowX-> what would intel like to see? :)
[07:01:18] <TheWhisper> I have
[07:01:20] <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/rdxcLZs.png
[07:01:24] <TheWhisper> right now
[07:01:58] <BillCriswell> CrowX-: I think they'd like to see something useful for your school to be honest.
[07:02:26] <Sal> bill, got an error in network
[07:02:32] <Sal> posted in pvt
[07:03:43] <seutje> TheWhisper: use a debounced function so it only fires when the user stops resizing for at least, say... 300ms
[07:03:58] <TheWhisper> No idea what that is :P
[07:04:17] <seutje> basically a function that fires a named settimeout and overrides it if it is fired before the settimeout ends
[07:04:25] <seutje> `g javascript debounce
[07:04:26] <b-ot> seutje: JavaScript Debounce Function - David Walsh ‚Üí http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[07:05:23] <seutje> so you one to fire immediately, have that one set the class, then have one not set to fire immediately, and have that remove the class
[07:05:46] <seutje> then you should have a bare minimum time the class is applied that equals the time you put on the debounced functions
[07:05:57] <TheWhisper> Actually, what I have now seems to work
[07:06:03] <TheWhisper> Thanks though, I'll look into those
[07:06:46] <BillCriswell> I just closed all my tab but I meant to open the one I just closed acidentally. =(
[07:06:49] <BillCriswell> I am not a smart man.
[07:06:52] <seutje> weird, I would image that implementation to remove the class immediately, in the same tick, if you will
[07:07:08] <seutje> BillCriswell: ctrl/cmd + shift + t
[07:07:13] <seutje> open last closed tab
[07:07:23] <seutje> goes back quite a bit
[07:07:28] <BillCriswell> seutje: I'm always incognito
[07:07:31] <seutje> (doesn't work in incognito ofc)
[07:07:35] <seutje> lol yeah I have that as well
[07:07:37] <drej> BillCriswell so much porn, so little time
[07:07:48] <seutje> more like so much cache/extensions
[07:07:50] <BillCriswell> Haha I wish!
[07:07:52] <seutje> so little actual testing
[07:08:15] <BillCriswell> I just like the idea of being able to close a window and have all my sessions on sites expire.
[07:09:09] <BillCriswell> This time it bit me in the ass! I'm usually careful, though.
[07:09:39] <seutje> you can have chrome prompt before closing btw
[07:09:51] <seutje> but that doesn't apply for cmd+shift+w
[07:10:17] <BillCriswell> seutje: That's exactly what I accidentally pressed lol
[07:10:24] <BillCriswell> I do have that option turned on.
[07:10:54] <seutje> I used to have an edited jsfiddle in a tab somewhere to prevent me from accidentally closing chromesie :P
[07:11:19] <seutje> praise the lord for onbeforeunload!
[07:12:28] <BillCriswell> I usually use jsbin, it doesn't do that now that I think about it.
[07:12:38] <Rickydaan> Hey guys, I am having some trouble. I can't figure out why tihs JSON Parse won't work in my GET statement, code:
[07:12:44] <Rickydaan> $.get( "php-console-puller.php", function( data ) {   var consoledata.val( JSON.parse( data ) );   $( "#console-part" ).html( data ); });
[07:13:05] <Rickydaan> Somehow at "var consoledata.val( JSON.parse( data ) );" it goes all wrong
[07:13:16] <BillCriswell> Rickydaan: Is it valid JSON?
[07:13:23] <BillCriswell> What's the error?
[07:13:25] <Rickydaan> It's encoded in PHP, so it should be
[07:13:30] <BillCriswell> Yes, ok sweet.
[07:13:36] <Rickydaan> SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[07:13:37] <BillCriswell> I've seem people build their own json. =(
[07:13:45] <systemfault> Yeah‚Ä¶ haha
[07:13:48] <systemfault> So stupid.
[07:13:55] <Rickydaan> BillCriswell: Those always will fail at complicated situations
[07:14:05] <Rickydaan> I am happy I can get help here this quickly o_o
[07:14:14] <Rickydaan> Working on my own Minecraft Control Panel, so this is a crucial part of it
[07:14:27] <Sal> BillCriswell, maybe i'm not using the right jquery call to get data from the mysql server. I'm using the $.ajax
[07:14:27] <BillCriswell> That feels like being rushed.
[07:14:40] <Sal> i see that there are many ways to do it
[07:14:49] <Sal> is the one i'm using the correct or best way?
[07:14:54] <Rickydaan> What do you mean, BillCriswell?
[07:14:56] <BillCriswell> Sal: Anyone should work essentially unless you're setting the data type wrong.
[07:14:57] <Sal> or is there something better?
[07:15:26] <Sal> damn
[07:15:27] <Rickydaan> I just cant figure out what is wrong in my code!
[07:15:42] <BillCriswell> Rickydaan: The var before consoledata.val() is the issue.
[07:15:57] <BillCriswell> You would use var for declaring the variable.
[07:15:59] <Rickydaan> How would I solve that, should I define "consoledata" before the script runs
[07:16:06] <Rickydaan> And use the .val inside of that
[07:16:12] <Rickydaan> So the code would be
[07:16:12] <BillCriswell> Rickydaan: What is consoledata?
[07:16:20] <Rickydaan> consoledata is still undefined
[07:16:29] <BillCriswell> What do you expect console data to be?
[07:16:31] <Rickydaan> It would contain the array with 150 entries
[07:16:36] <Rickydaan> It is an array
[07:16:43] <BillCriswell> So why are you trying to use .val() on that?
[07:17:03] <Rickydaan> I have to redefine it
[07:17:16] <Rickydaan> I actually get the data in that script,
[07:17:19] <Macaveli> Please take a look at my problem -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23133096/jquery-validate-file-after-filename-change-err-file-not-found
[07:17:20] <BillCriswell> .val() is for setting inputs in jQuery.
[07:17:31] <BillCriswell> and getting.
[07:17:33] <Rickydaan> I fail then, lol
[07:17:43] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, how do I get the path then?
[07:17:47] <Rickydaan> I've read some other similar questions, and I turned crazy
[07:18:00] <BillCriswell> maybe you want: var consoledata = JSON.parse( data );
[07:18:28] <Rickydaan> Yeah, I just figured it out
[07:18:40] <Rickydaan> I don't know what went wrong before as I did that multiple times
[07:18:50] <Rickydaan> Well, thank you very much for your assistance, BillCriswell
[07:18:55] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:18:58] <Rickydaan> :)
[07:19:15] <BillCriswell> Sal: I would use $.getJSON() and in your PHP set the proper json headers.
[07:20:06] <BillCriswell> Sal: So like: header('Content-Type: application/json'); echo json_encode($data);
[07:20:22] <BillCriswell> Just make sure the header() call is before ANYTHING it output.
[07:20:27] <Sal> yes, on the php side, its already like that
[07:21:43] <blue_warlock> why cant get position on items from the right ?
[07:21:49] <Sal> BillCriswell, this is what i have: http://pastebin.com/jGmbq6hH
[07:22:04] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: use left + width and you have right
[07:22:22] <blue_warlock> omg T_T
[07:22:28] <Sal> maybe its the gzip that mess up things
[07:22:39] <blue_warlock> it becomes an infinite calculation
[07:22:39] <BillCriswell> Sal: Yes. I think the link I sent you mentioned that.
[07:27:11] <Sal> BillCriswell, yep, it was the gzip
[07:30:17] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[07:34:21] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, Updated the topic please take another look and maybe to the chat
[07:36:07] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: So the user uses the file for a file input, then changes the files name, then there's an error and you want to prevent that from happening?
[07:36:42] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, chrome just throws and error and I want to throw a custom error and stops it from chrome throwing the error
[07:36:53] <Macaveli> Just prevent the user from paniqueing
[07:39:30] <sledgeDJ> seutje: works great. just one small modification... can we make it scroll to the position instead of jumping?
[07:39:46] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: Isn't that what the fiddle in your question is doing?
[07:40:06] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, doesn't work always gives error even if the file is valid
[07:40:10] <BillCriswell> Oh wait. You have me all confused.
[07:40:19] <BillCriswell> You can't check if a local file exists.
[07:40:20] <Macaveli> With valid I mean nothing is changed to the file
[07:40:37] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, there must be way if you go to www.imgur.com
[07:40:44] <Macaveli> and you select an image for upload
[07:40:55] <Macaveli> and you delete that image and than press upload
[07:40:56] <seutje> sledgeDJ: sure, just animate the scrollTop property of the body or html element
[07:40:58] <Macaveli> they throw a nice error
[07:41:21] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to alert the value of an input box, but it not returns anything. http://fiddle.jshell.net/DETbD/6/ Helpø
[07:41:27] <BillCriswell> It uploads immediately for me. Don't even get a chance to change the name.
[07:41:32] <sledgeDJ> seutje: i hate putting u to work but can you please show me this in the jjsfiddle?
[07:42:04] <BillCriswell> lol
[07:43:10] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, go to upload images "computer" -> "Asks for file" -> Selecte file -> Delete/Change the file name -> "Press start upload"
[07:45:09] <seutje> sledgeDJ: sry, trying to finish up something before I bolt home, my roommate forgot his key and is being all sad on the porch
[07:45:27] <sledgeDJ> lol no problem
[07:45:33] <sledgeDJ> can anyone else help me with this?
[07:45:48] <seutje> basically replace the  scrollTop() call with $('body'').animate({scrollTop: value})
[07:46:11] <seutje> or whatever variable I had used previously for the value
[07:47:00] <blue_warlock> how can i get position relative to another div ?
[07:47:20] <blue_warlock> exemple i got main div id = header_encap
[07:47:43] <blue_warlock> i want the position of certain <li> respect the main target
[07:48:07] <blue_warlock> or respect to the page
[07:49:12] <Danq> Hello I need some help with this http://jsfiddle.net/jKuGq/
[07:49:35] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: I'd have to research how to do this a bit more.
[07:49:43] <Danq> why can't I add the </div> ?
[07:49:53] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, chrome throws an error indeed
[07:50:02] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, thanks bill
[07:50:05] <Macaveli> Appreciate it
[07:50:11] <Macaveli> I'm going home now
[07:50:13] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: I'm not doing it now since I'm at work.
[07:50:22] <Macaveli> spend 8 hours of billable time on it
[07:50:44] <BillCriswell> I would just keep researching. I think you'd have to look into the filesystem api stuff in html5.
[07:50:52] <blue_warlock> ok i have to use offset
[07:50:55] <blue_warlock> =)
[07:50:56] <Danq> is it not possible to add a </div> with before() ?
[07:51:00] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/
[07:51:50] <BillCriswell> Danq: That's now how this works.
[07:52:09] <Danq> :|
[07:52:21] <systemfault> Danq: What is </div> to you?
[07:52:59] <Danq> a closing tag </div>
[07:53:04] <systemfault> It‚Äôs nothing but a closing tag, it‚Äôs not xml.. it‚Äôs not html
[07:53:22] <BillCriswell> Danq: What's your goal here?
[07:53:26] <systemfault> Danq: Right, so use the proper syntax.
[07:55:01] <Danq> I have a comment thread and it's not working properly when someone replies
[07:55:34] <BillCriswell> We need to go lower than that.
[07:55:35] <Danq> I'm trying to add a closing tag with jquery
[07:56:16] <systemfault> Danq: The browser doesn‚Äôt care about HTML. It only uses it to create it‚Äôs internal data structure (The DOM)
[07:56:39] <systemfault> Danq: Either fix the HTML or move nodes around.
[07:57:02] <decx> if you want to add a closing tag you must be adding an opening tag somewhere
[07:57:03] <Danq> I can't fix it because it wordpress fault
[07:57:13] <systemfault> Danq: Fix the theme?
[07:57:22] <sledgeDJ> seutje: forget the animation it is not even working before that
[07:57:34] <Danq> its not the theme it's the standard comment-template
[07:57:39] <Danq> :/
[07:57:57] <Danq> decx I hear you thanks, so it's not possible :D
[07:58:21] <decx> i'm pretty sure you're messing with something somewhere if you're missing closing tags in the wp comment template
[07:59:31] <systemfault> Danq: Anyway, the thing is‚Ä¶. once the HTML is parsed, there‚Äôs no such thing as a closing tag. It‚Äôs a tree datastructure of DOM Nodes
[07:59:50] <systemfault> Danq: So, I guess you could move nodes around to get the effect you want.
[07:59:53] <sledgeDJ> seutje: forget the animation it is not even working before that
[08:00:52] <Danq> I see, thanks for clearing it up
[08:01:06] <Danq> I'll have to force it somehow >:)
[08:01:33] <decx> the markup let me slid right in with almost no resistance
[08:01:36] <BillCriswell> Danq: Have fun bashing your head against the wall a bit down the line.
[08:01:54] <Danq> :D thanks
[08:02:01] <BillCriswell> decx: That's a weird nickname for... nevermind.
[08:02:41] <BinaryKitten> DecX - 10 10
[08:02:51] <sledgeDJ> i need some help modifiying this code... http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/3/  i want to make it so the when a question is click the browser scroll so the the h2 (the question) is lets say 50 pixels below top of browser window. can someone please help me with this?
[08:05:03] <BillCriswell> What?
[08:05:13] <BillCriswell> Oh, I got you now.
[08:05:31] <BillCriswell> Didn't someone answer this for you already sledgeDJ?
[08:06:14] <sledgeDJ> yes... but there answer didnt work
[08:06:28] <sledgeDJ> BillCriswell: yes... but there answer didnt work
[08:06:38] <sledgeDJ> BillCriswell: want to see what they provided?
[08:07:01] <BillCriswell> sledgeDJ: I saw them. They're the answer anyone would give you.
[08:07:09] <sledgeDJ> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/6/
[08:07:23] <sledgeDJ> BillCriswell: look it does not work
[08:07:54] <sledgeDJ> BillCriswell: make screen heigt very small. then click on first question. scroll down then click on second question.
[08:10:02] <decx> that's bad ux, you're changing the position of a click area and with that the position where the users eyes are focused on
[08:10:28] <sledgeDJ> BillCriswell: do u see the issue?
[08:10:43] <decx> it can work, but you've got to do it slick. and not like... this
[08:11:28] <BillCriswell> sledgeDJ: This is working. You're changing the position of the question.
[08:12:02] <sledgeDJ> i want to make it so the question clicked is on the top of the screen
[08:12:08] <sledgeDJ> this is not happening
[08:13:06] <BillCriswell> You can't do that cleanly when the content above it is sliding
[08:13:48] <sledgeDJ> cant we make the content above slide closed then the new question opens and the new question positions correctly?
[08:15:23] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:15:29] <BillCriswell> It's still going to feel weird.
[08:16:05] <sledgeDJ> BillCriswell: can u help me to get this working please?
[08:17:17] <lieber> hi guys, i'm trying to implement a simple script too fadein and out some news, but i'm not a js programmer, can anyone tell me how can i loop this forever? code: http://pastebin.com/HT35Dcei
[08:17:36] <sledgeDJ> lieber: i can help you with this i think
[08:18:00] <lieber> sledgeDJ: oh this would be awesome
[08:18:56] <sledgeDJ> lieber: you want it to do the three pieces of news and then start over?
[08:19:46] <lieber> sledgeDJ: yea i just want to repeat this sequence for ever
[08:19:52] <decx> always try to abstract your functionality
[08:19:54] <lieber> in my code he just make the animation 1 time
[08:20:05] <decx> right now you'd have to add code for every news entry you add
[08:20:34] <sledgeDJ> ya it is kind of sloppy
[08:21:00] <sledgeDJ> decx you should also put your code in jsfiddle so any of us can help you more easily
[08:21:06] <sledgeDJ> can u please do that and then i will help
[08:21:17] <sledgeDJ> sorry not decx i mean lieber
[08:21:27] <sledgeDJ> lieber please put your code in jsfiddle
[08:21:48] <lieber> no problem
[08:24:14] <sledgeDJ> decx: for him i am thinking more along the lines of $( ".news" ).each(function()
[08:24:31] <systemfault> Nah
[08:24:44] <systemfault> A promise-based loop would probably be the best.
[08:25:55] <systemfault> Also‚Ä¶ .ready doesn‚Äôt work for anything but document (unless it‚Äôs some weird plugin that adds it)
[08:26:04] <sledgeDJ> systemfault: maybe you should help him then :-)
[08:26:07] <sledgeDJ> i tired lol
[08:26:22] <systemfault> Would be easier to help if he had a working example.
[08:26:35] <systemfault> Now‚Ä¶ I would have to write code without being sure it works.
[08:26:36] <sledgeDJ> can someone help me with my issue?
[08:26:53] <sledgeDJ> systemfault: i agree i think he is adding it to jsfiddle as we speak
[08:26:55] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: What is your issue?
[08:27:09] <sledgeDJ> i need some help modifiying this code... http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/3/  i want to make it so the when a question is click the browser scroll so the the h2 (the question) is lets say 50 pixels below top of browser window. can someone please help me with this?
[08:27:50] <lieber> sledgeDJ: got it
[08:27:50] <sledgeDJ> i think we need to make the content slide closed then the new question opens and the new question positions correctly?
[08:27:56] <lieber> http://jsfiddle.net/cXrA2/ sledgeDJ
[08:28:04] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: Sure.
[08:28:27] <sledgeDJ> systemfault: help lieber first then if u can help me please
[08:29:06] <sledgeDJ> systemfault: i am interested in seeing what you do for lieber
[08:29:09] <decx> lieber http://jsfiddle.net/Lwgwb/
[08:29:35] <decx> probably should put those vars outside the timer
[08:29:36] <decx> yikes
[08:29:36] <decx> ^^
[08:29:47] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: decx solved it ;)
[08:29:50] <sledgeDJ> btw why not use this leiber?  http://sandbox.sebnitu.com/jquery/quovolver/
[08:30:30] <sledgeDJ> ok so can someone help me with my issue now pretty please?  ;-)
[08:32:36] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/7/ Something like that
[08:33:03] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: You might want to modify the params to .animate‚Ä¶ but this is the diea.
[08:33:05] <systemfault> *idea
[08:33:18] <sledgeDJ> answers are not being revealed
[08:33:46] <systemfault> Ah.. was I supposed to know that?
[08:34:19] <lieber> sledgeDJ: that's a excelent choice. ty
[08:34:22] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/8/
[08:34:25] <decx> what kind of psychic are you, common
[08:34:26] <lieber> decx: really elegant code, ty very much
[08:34:40] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: Look the latest paste
[08:34:43] <decx> lieber http://jsfiddle.net/Lwgwb/5/ is better
[08:35:23] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: 2 seconds, I‚Äôll copy your code...
[08:35:43] <sledgeDJ> systemfault: not working like i need it to... when u click a question if another answer is displaying i want it to close the other answer before showing the new answer
[08:35:50] <sledgeDJ> yes please
[08:36:25] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: You make me think of a project manager I use to have‚Ä¶. adding requirements at random.
[08:36:28] <systemfault> ;)
[08:36:48] <sledgeDJ> no those were there in my original code
[08:37:08] <decx> but that's every project manager and customer systemfault ;)
[08:40:06] <sledgeDJ> systemfault: look at my original code http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/3/ it did do that  :-)
[08:40:08] <systemfault> sledgeDJ: http://jsfiddle.net/Jy94h/10/ ?
[08:40:50] <decx> add body { height: 5000px} then you don't have to squint into a tiny preview window
[08:41:17] <sledgeDJ> systemfault: looks good let me ask you one more thing and be a project manager now.
[08:41:25] <systemfault> ;)
[08:41:32] <sledgeDJ> i dont want it going to top of page but 50px below bottom of page
[08:43:24] <decx> you have a bright future in management
[08:43:47] <BillCriswell> The brightest.
[08:43:55] <sledgeDJ> lol
[08:43:57] <sledgeDJ> thanks
[08:44:31] <decx> i must assume systemfault went out to punch a kitten
[08:44:38] <systemfault> :D
[08:46:31] <dim> hi
[08:46:42] <duch_kazatel> guys
[08:46:49] <duch_kazatel> something wonderful is happening
[08:46:50] <duch_kazatel> https://twitter.com/DevOps_BobRoss
[08:47:02] <dim> I want to do something simple, and I'm very noob in js still, so I hope I can get some help here (mainly pointers to docs and examples to work from)
[08:47:17] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ dim
[08:47:18] <b-ot> dim: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:48:22] <decx> he should have written happy quadtrees
[08:48:25] <dim> given a textarea and a form button, I want to run an ajax query when the button is hit, get the result (csv, say) and replace the current contents on the page with the result: the form has to become a table, basically
[08:48:32] <dim> maybe with an active tab switch too
[08:48:45] <duch_kazatel> dim start with .on() and .ajax()
[08:48:52] <dim> it sounds simple enough to me, and I'm already using bootstrap and jquery
[08:50:09] <dim> so how do I replace a form with a table on the page at button click time? any jquery based example?
[08:50:32] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery replace
[08:50:33] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .replaceWith() | jQuery API Documentation ‚Üí http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[08:50:38] <duch_kazatel> :)
[08:51:03] <duch_kazatel> .on() is for binding your click, $.ajax() for fetching your data, and .replace() (or .replaceWith()) for replacing content.
[08:51:28] <dim> cool, thanks, I'm beginning to see light ;-)
[08:51:36] <decx> you send stuff to your server, get data back. you can handle that data the same as you would any other type of data and either append it somewhere, fill stuff with it, search for stuff in the data and use that. whatever
[08:51:52] <[ZiP]> Hello everyone!
[08:52:09] <dim> decx: I know how to talk to the server and return data from there, I'm very new to doing stuff in the browser side of things
[08:52:18] <dim> I'm used to just returning full new pages
[08:52:53] <[ZiP]> I'm new to jQuery but wanting to enable a simple form validation with it and wondering if someone might be able to assist me?
[08:52:53] <dim> but here I want to keep data on the client side in between UI actions... so I figured ajax and more HTML dynamic are required
[08:53:16] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] do you have any particular questions?
[08:53:19] <[ZiP]> All I need to do is check the value of a form field upon submission if it's wrong display error if its right submit the form
[08:53:40] <Aristata> Hey guys, I have an ajax call that is basically doing $('div').html(data) to fill a div with the received content. Immediately after that I am trying to set a $('.overlay') height to the new height of the div, but at that point the divs height is still 0 pixels. Does anyone know a way to solve this? I have tried .promise().done(function(){}) on the .html() function but that is doing the same thing.
[08:53:43] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] are you looking for a plugin?  because you could also write that yourself.
[08:53:50] <[ZiP]> It should be rather easy I think but I just dont know how to get started
[08:54:10] <[ZiP]> duch_kazatel well actually this is for a form that was built with ShortStackApp.com by my co-worker
[08:54:33] <[ZiP]> I need to use their code widget to enable this error checking since they don't offer that functionality in their form designer
[08:54:52] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] dunno what that is but it shouldn't matter.  the frontend is the frontend.  you can hook into it however you'd like probably.
[08:55:12] <[ZiP]> I just need to check the value of a field make sure its 12 exactly if not say 'Sorry that's incorrect please try again'
[08:55:14] <Rickydaan> Hey guys, yet another question of mine, an IF statement is not working
[08:55:20] <Rickydaan>   $.get( "get_user.php?username=" + username + "&password=" + password, function( data ) {     if( data == "1" ){
[08:55:30] <Rickydaan> When I alert the "data" it comes up with "1"
[08:55:36] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] okay.  start by looking at event binding with .on()
[08:55:37] <Rickydaan> But it still wont pass the IF statemen
[08:56:04] <Aristata> Rickydaan:  That should be on a success function
[08:56:19] <[ZiP]> https://api.jquery.com/on/ ?
[08:56:21] <Rickydaan> This works just fine, I use it in all of my projects
[08:56:42] <decx> console.log(data) and look at it
[08:56:42] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] yep
[08:56:43] <Aristata> $.get(something, function(data){}).success(function(data){ your if statement here })
[08:57:01] <[ZiP]> Ok Ill read that page and see if I can determine how to do this, thanks!
[08:57:02] <Rickydaan> Decx, that is my point, the values are matching, but the IF statement wont pass
[08:57:21] <decx> well maybe the if is a grand old wizard
[08:57:45] <Rickydaan> Haha
[08:57:45] <duch_kazatel> Rickydaan do a console.log(data)
[08:57:52] <duch_kazatel> also, avoid using ==
[08:57:52] <Rickydaan> Duch, I used "alert"
[08:58:00] <Rickydaan> Duch_kazatel, how would I soleve that
[08:58:01] <duch_kazatel> Rickydaan use console.log instead.
[08:58:12] <Rickydaan> I know, but what should I use instead of ==
[08:58:16] <duch_kazatel> ===
[08:58:22] <iLikeYogurt> hello, i their a simple way to do the touch event for mobile browser. i dont want use javascript libraries
[08:58:23] <Rickydaan> Ok
[08:58:24] <duch_kazatel> don't rely on type coercion.
[08:58:33] <[ZiP]> yikes Im lost maybe I should try JavaScript for this
[08:58:35] <duch_kazatel> iLikeYogurt sure - search google for touch events.
[08:58:44] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] huh?  jquery IS javascript :)\
[08:59:10] <[ZiP]> see what I mean :-) totally lost
[08:59:31] <[ZiP]> I wonder if this can be done with PHP
[08:59:43] <Aristata> jquery is just a bunch of javascript functions that make up a library
[08:59:45] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] not unless you're find with the page reloading.
[08:59:56] <[ZiP]> thats what I was afraid of
[09:00:10] <[ZiP]> nope I need do it real time like AJAX or something
[09:00:11] <iLikeYogurt> duch_kazatel: $("#fire").on('touchstart', function () { not working i want to
[09:00:17] <Aristata> I have an ajax call that is basically doing $('div').html(data) to fill a div with the received content. Immediately after that I am trying to set a $('.overlay') height to the new height of the div, but at that point the divs height is still 0 pixels. Does anyone know a way to solve this? I have tried .promise().done(function(){}) on the .html() function but that is doing the same thing.
[09:00:54] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] http://jsfiddle.net/4cbXe/2/
[09:00:56] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[09:01:04] <duch_kazatel> iLikeYogurt can you setup a jsfiddle of it?
[09:01:06] <[ZiP]> Could anyone perhaps provide me a very simple error checking example using jQuery? I'm sure if I had an example I could suit it to my needs
[09:01:10] <[ZiP]> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:01:17] <[ZiP]> ok I'll look there
[09:01:21] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] that shows you how to use .on().
[09:01:34] <[ZiP]> excellent! appreciate the help
[09:02:18] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4cbXe/3/
[09:02:22] <[ZiP]> would I have to change on click to on submit?
[09:02:23] <duch_kazatel> for a basic version of what you want.
[09:02:26] <iLikeYogurt> duch_kazatel: i think i use it the toe.js , is small
[09:02:40] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] if it's a form, yes.
[09:02:56] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] you'll also want to event.preventDefault(); in that case.
[09:03:02] <[ZiP]> yes its a form
[09:03:10] <[ZiP]> field name promotion_field_1
[09:03:47] <Rickydaan> function login( username, password ){   var toReturn = false;   $.get( "get_user.php?username=" + username + "&password=" + password, function( data ) {     if( data === "1" ){       toReturn = true;     }else{       toReturn = false;     }   });   return toReturn; }
[09:03:57] <[ZiP]> Im looking at your example and that's close but just not for a form wondering how to modify that and display error message if it's not 12 or submit if it is 12
[09:04:00] <Rickydaan> The IF statement where "data" gets checked if it's "1"
[09:04:03] <Rickydaan> It fails
[09:04:04] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Rickydaan
[09:04:04] <b-ot> Rickydaan: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:04:06] <Rickydaan> Even if I log it to console
[09:04:12] <Rickydaan> Oh sorry Duch
[09:04:29] <Rickydaan> http://jsfiddle.net/yDUkx/
[09:04:34] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] huh?  we're not going to write it for you.  i gave you soem basics.
[09:04:39] <Rickydaan> Where I check "data" it returns false
[09:04:41] <Rickydaan> Even tough it's true
[09:05:11] <relipse> I am working on a page written entirely in javascript, how do I deal with templates?
[09:05:15] <Rickydaan> I check if it's "1", it is "1"
[09:05:25] <BillCriswell> Rickydaan: This isn't how ajax works.
[09:05:27] <[ZiP]> Ill try changing click to submit and see what happens thanks
[09:05:45] <Rickydaan> BillCriswell, I checked if data was 1, which it is
[09:05:48] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] you also want to bind to the form element and not the button
[09:05:49] <Rickydaan> But it still isnt working
[09:05:57] <duch_kazatel> Rickydaan change that to 1 instead of '1'
[09:06:08] <Aristata> BillCriswell:  I tried explaining that to him but he has this code in other projects and it works so he is right.
[09:06:17] <duch_kazatel> Rickydaan also: jsfiddle.net/yDUkx/1/
[09:06:29] <Rickydaan> duch_kazatel Its a string directly received from a string (Webpage)
[09:06:39] <duch_kazatel> Rickydaan but toReturn won't return what you want it to basically ever
[09:07:03] <Rickydaan> How come? :o
[09:07:08] <duch_kazatel> Rickydaan $.get() (or any of the other ajax functions) don't stop page execution.
[09:07:17] <decx> it'S always going to return false
[09:07:19] <duch_kazatel> that fires of a request asyncronously and keeps on moving.
[09:07:20] <decx> bawsicly
[09:07:30] <[ZiP]> I can do that by changing the begining of the function from ('a') to ('name_of_form') ?
[09:07:51] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] no, you'd need to use an id, class, or tag
[09:07:53] <Rickydaan> Why wouldnt the toReturn value be changed?
[09:08:03] <duch_kazatel> Rickydaan because the get request hasn't completed in time.
[09:08:03] <Rickydaan> Because I can't find my mistake :s
[09:08:09] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] you could also use an attribute selector.
[09:08:16] <BillCriswell> Rickydaan: Because ajax is async.
[09:08:27] <Aristata> Rickydaan:  why don't you just take the advice I gave you twenty minutes ago instead of being so certain you are correct
[09:08:28] <[ZiP]> I think the attribute selector might work best
[09:08:28] <Rickydaan> Wow, this is confusing, I gtg in a sec
[09:08:37] <Rickydaan> Arisatata: I never read your advice?
[09:08:42] <Aristata> $.get(something, function(data){}).success(function(data){ your if statement here })
[09:08:46] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] can you give the form an ID or Class instead?
[09:08:49] <Rickydaan> Ohhh
[09:08:53] <Aristata> Put your if statement in the success function
[09:08:57] <decx> login goes like this return false, start get, return toreturn..... get request comes back and sets toreturn true
[09:09:00] <Rickydaan> AFK for now
[09:09:01] <duch_kazatel> actually use .done()
[09:09:09] <Rickydaan> OHH now I get it
[09:09:13] <duch_kazatel> .success() is deprecated.
[09:09:23] <Aristata> duch_kazatel:  good to know!
[09:09:27] <Rickydaan> Couldnt I just place the return in the $.GET now?
[09:09:52] <duch_kazatel> Rickydaan nope.
[09:09:59] <Rickydaan> Oh :(
[09:10:04] <Rickydaan> I'll look into it tomorrow, I must go now
[09:10:20] <[ZiP]> it already has ID and class for both the form tag itself and the input tag Im trying to validate
[09:10:25] <BillCriswell> Rickydaan: http://jsbin.com/sulofiqu/1/edit
[09:10:36] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] what's the ID or Class for the form tag?
[09:10:39] <BillCriswell> Notice how outside the callback it's not available.
[09:11:25] <BillCriswell> You might get lucky once in a while and it'll show up, but don't let that fool you.
[09:11:27] <Rickydaan> BillCriswell: Thank you for your tips today, and of course everyone else. I gtg now, bye!!!
[09:11:34] <BillCriswell> Laterrr
[09:11:37] <Rickydaan> Lol, Bill, thank you very much, I understand now
[09:11:41] <computer2000> i need to register a click handler on a element but it should only fire if it didnt happen inside a certain div with class foo... how to do that?
[09:11:43] <Rickydaan> I've been such a fool not reading lol
[09:12:06] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 use event delegation and only bind to the divs you want.
[09:12:12] <computer2000> tried this but didnt work: $('#lightbox').on('click', 'div:not(.inner)', function(event) {...});
[09:12:29] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 have a simple fiddle you can share?
[09:12:33] <decx> wrong way around probably
[09:13:12] <[ZiP]> the class is promotion_form
[09:13:14] <nhulea> hey is there a way to check if 2 divs have the same class name ?
[09:13:30] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] then use $('.promotion_form')
[09:13:38] <nhulea> .attr
[09:13:39] <b-ot> nhulea: used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[09:13:43] <decx> hasClass('.myclass')
[09:13:49] <[ZiP]> ok thats what I was thinking thanks
[09:13:50] <BillCriswell> nhulea: $div1.hasClass('foo') && $div2.hasClass('foo')
[09:14:03] <duch_kazatel> we're on FIRE today
[09:14:30] <BillCriswell> pew pew pew
[09:14:43] <duch_kazatel> SPACE LASERS
[09:15:01] <CrowX-> is there any practical difference between implementing object methods within the object function, or outside of it with the .prototype. thing?
[09:15:26] <duch_kazatel> "within the object function" - mind giving us a sample of what you mean?
[09:15:31] <BillCriswell> http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100719012131/uncyclopedia/images/b/bb/Kid1.gif
[09:15:43] <duch_kazatel> http://b-real.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/laser_gun_pew_pew_pew_meme.jpg
[09:16:04] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:16:27] <shubhamGeek> CrowX: with the prototype thing, all the objects are going to share the same methods, while with the function approach each object will have its own method.
[09:16:48] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, http://pastebin.com/Fe4CvJCD
[09:17:16] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- okay - by saying "function", you are all ready implying object.
[09:17:20] <[ZiP]> duch_kazatel: is this on the right path then? $('.promotion_form').on('submit', function(){
[09:17:28] <duch_kazatel> because everything is javascript is a happy like object.
[09:17:33] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] a-hyup.
[09:17:43] <lieber> decx: I got a problem with your code
[09:17:57] <[ZiP]> great! thanks
[09:18:01] <lieber> can't put links inside div.
[09:18:10] <[ZiP]> I need to get a jQuery book :-)
[09:18:26] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] no need - https://learn.jquery.com/
[09:18:28] <CrowX-> shubhamGeek, so if I use it within the function, it just wastes memory, right?
[09:19:06] <CrowX-> <duch_kazatel> because everything is javascript is a happy like object.  <- what do you mean?
[09:19:14] <duch_kazatel> *little
[09:19:20] <duch_kazatel> i was bob rossing it up in here.
[09:19:30] <duch_kazatel> but seriously, everything in javascript is an object.
[09:19:34] <decx> lieber add a z-index to the active class
[09:19:50] <nhulea> ok I think I will try something similar to that I just wanted to check that if a div was clicked twice there was a condition that said false if class name is the same I think may be able to set it manually
[09:20:01] <decx> the entry are all above each other only invisible, with a z-index you can push the active to the top
[09:20:03] <shubhamGeek> CrowX: Yups. Generally the prototype approach is preferred. If you see some code generated by the coffeescript compiler, it does the same.
[09:20:22] <duch_kazatel> eeeh, depends on what you're doing.
[09:20:24] <duch_kazatel> imo.
[09:20:25] <decx> object literal 4 lyfe
[09:20:40] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:21:03] <lieber> decx: gonna search about it
[09:21:51] <CrowX-> btw, are javascript object's variables private or public by default?
[09:22:12] <decx> lieber it's juts one extra line in the .active css rule http://jsfiddle.net/Lwgwb/6/
[09:22:17] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- javascript is function scoped.
[09:22:19] <lieber> decx: oh i got it working, ty
[09:22:31] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- properties are scoped to whatever the object is scoped to.
[09:23:10] <CrowX-> i didn't mean about the scope
[09:23:12] <CrowX-> but
[09:23:17] <CrowX-> sec
[09:23:19] <shubhamGeek> CrowX: if you come from a Java or C++ background, then the object variables are public and the methods too.
[09:23:32] <duch_kazatel> "object variables"
[09:23:33] <decx> lieber i'd probably also stop the timeout if the cursor is above the news element and turn it back on, on mouse out. better ux
[09:23:34] <CrowX-> ah, that's what I was asking :)
[09:23:37] <CrowX-> thanks
[09:23:37] <duch_kazatel> sounds funny to me.
[09:23:51] <CrowX-> and yeah, i come from both c++ and java
[09:24:10] <[ZiP]> Hi duch one more thing sorry then I think I've got it. I just determined that when this form is rendered the class and ID as as follows class="ss_promotion_form" id="form_promotion" therefore which one should I use or does it matter?
[09:24:13] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- so in javascript land we have object with properties.  no classes, so there aren't "variables in objects" :)
[09:24:23] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] the ID.
[09:24:29] <[ZiP]> great thanks
[09:24:31] <duch_kazatel> it'll be faster and it's guaranteed to be unique.
[09:24:41] <duch_kazatel> well, it SHOULD be unique.
[09:26:03] <[ZiP]> also from your example where you have if ($('input') should I replace input with the id of my input tag I'm wanting to validate?
[09:26:13] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] yes.
[09:26:31] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] are you familiar with CSS selectors?
[09:26:43] <[ZiP]> thanks and yes I am
[09:26:47] <computer2000> i need to place a canvas element 100% width and height over the entire content, but i want click only to register on the drawn svg inside of it - so that if one clicks beneath the drawn svg, the click goes through the canvas and to the element underneath... makes sense? anyone can help?
[09:26:51] <duch_kazatel> [ZiP] jQuery selectors are basically the same.
[09:27:12] <[ZiP]> ok great thanks
[09:27:38] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 check out pointer-events.
[09:27:58] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn pointer-events
[09:27:59] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: pointer-events - CSS | MDN ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[09:28:03] <computer2000> duch_kazatel: you mean the css property, i already checked that
[09:28:03] <lieber> decx: how can i do this? i notice that when i stop the cursor he doesnt refresh the url
[09:28:22] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 setting pointer-events: none; will have clicks go "through" an element.
[09:28:40] <computer2000> but then all clicks go through the canvas ... but i need to register clicks on it as long as they land on the drawn svg in the middle of the screen
[09:29:00] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 hrm.
[09:29:00] <computer2000> which can have random form
[09:29:32] <computer2000> duch_kazatel: its like i'd need to check if the click has landed on the svg, and if not, let it through the element
[09:31:22] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 that gets into unfamiliar territory for me. svg and canvas are strange mistresses.
[09:32:30] <decx> lieber sorry i have to focus on actualy work now :( but you can clear a timeout with... clearTimeout() ;)
[09:32:38] <decx> -y
[09:33:06] <TheWhisper> hi
[09:33:11] <TheWhisper> if(!headerWrapper.hasClass("panelLeft")) {}
[09:33:30] <TheWhisper> I want this to say "if the element has the class panelLeft DO NOT run"
[09:33:39] <TheWhisper> or "if the element DOES NOT have the class panelLeft then do run"
[09:33:49] <TheWhisper> I though that was the proper syntax, but it doesn't seem to be working
[09:35:19] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper that should work.
[09:35:27] <TheWhisper> it doesn't seem to be working
[09:35:28] <TheWhisper> hm
[09:35:30] <TheWhisper> lemme take another look
[09:35:37] <duch_kazatel> try headerWrapper.hasClass("panelLeft") !== true ?
[09:35:48] <TheWhisper> k I'll try
[09:37:33] <decx> i've used !x.hasClass(y) before and it worked iirc
[09:37:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah it should work fine, but i'm wondering if maybe they've formatted something incorrectly.
[09:38:04] <decx> it must work technically as hasclass returns either true or false
[09:38:39] <TheWhisper> Oh, duch_kazatel, I had a function that was
[09:38:39] <TheWhisper> uh
[09:38:40] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:38:44] <TheWhisper> collapsed
[09:38:47] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper :)
[09:38:50] <TheWhisper> in the editor and didn't notice it :P
[09:38:53] <duch_kazatel> that's what i was going for.
[09:39:43] <duch_kazatel> i will now shamelessly admit that the rhythm guitar part from "Sweet Emotion" is one of my favorite things to play.
[09:43:46] <computer2000> anyone knows how to select a path inside a svg with css?
[09:44:53] <decx> add a class
[09:45:15] <decx> svg has its own style properties like fill
[09:47:19] <decx> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/dZSmc/
[09:54:27] <Biganon> Hello ; small problem with this page : http://www.noctambule.ch/testaccueil/ if you type a letter in the search box, such as "a", you'll see a big list appear, but then if you scroll it the background does not adapt...
[09:54:38] <Biganon> you get a grey rectangle at the bottom, which is pretty ugly
[09:54:43] <Biganon> any idea how to fix tht ?
[09:56:15] <decx> add your fixed background to the body and not the div
[09:58:37] <sledgeDJ> ok guys i have an issue. i am using smint ( http://www.outyear.co.uk/smint/ ) for my nav menu. problem is i have a div that changes sizes due to some other jquery script (the faq thing i was working on earlier) the problem is the when the div changes sizes smint doesnt know that the div changed sizes and it screws up the nav. is there a way to tell smint that the div size changed?
[09:58:51] <Biganon> done, but now on the first search after opening the page the dropdown menu is slightly pushed to the right :\
[09:59:41] <decx> switching the background has no influence on the position of your autosuggest box ;)
[09:59:58] <Biganon> try with the letter 'e'
[10:00:52] <Biganon> it was probably there before but I just noticed this bug
[10:01:58] <decx> now that is interesting :>
[10:02:15] <Biganon> isn't it :D
[10:02:17] <decx> probably because it's offsetting the area where no scrollbar converts to scrollbar
[10:02:38] <decx> that's why i like to show the vertical scrollbar by default, to prevent that jump
[10:02:56] <Biganon> probably has to do with the weird "hack" I had to use to have my copyright footer behave like it should
[10:03:31] <Biganon> I'm gonna use the scrollbar mode it's cleaner I guess
[10:04:10] <decx> yes, overflow-y: scroll; on html should fix that
[10:05:52] <harsk> hey, i need help with jquery / ajax form on submit
[10:05:56] <sledgeDJ> anyone have any input for me?
[10:06:13] <harsk> basically i have a html form that i want to load when another form has been submitted
[10:07:22] <decx> tomorrow is a holiday and i have nothing in the fridge, good thing i noticed early enough
[10:07:37] <sledgeDJ> decx: can u help me with my issue please?
[10:07:53] <ankurk_> decx: there's a holiday in US as well?
[10:08:02] <decx> i'm in germany
[10:08:16] <decx> sledge sorry never used smint
[10:08:55] <sledgeDJ> decx: it is a pretty simple jquery plugin. can u please look at it.
[10:09:07] <ankurk_> oh, looks like a holiday in most of the countries
[10:10:18] <decx> well if it's so easy then you shouldnt have a problem (Kappa)
[10:10:42] <sledgeDJ> lol
[10:10:53] <sledgeDJ> when i said simple i meant it is not many lines of code
[10:11:02] <sledgeDJ> i am new to jquery so for me it aint so simple
[10:11:48] <duch_kazatel> sledgeDJ then how are you able to assess the simplicity of it?
[10:12:18] <BillCriswell> I actually just understood something going on in angular outside of the phone list tutorial. FINALLY
[10:12:21] <sledgeDJ> duch_kazatel: it was a bad choice of words
[10:12:46] <decx> after your earlier destruction of systemfaults sanity i'm staying away from your problems for today :>
[10:12:57] <duch_kazatel> hahahahahahaha
[10:14:02] <harsk> can anyone help w/ my show/hide form issue?
[10:14:20] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ harsk
[10:14:20] <b-ot> harsk: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:14:39] <duch_kazatel> harsk - don't ask to ask.  ask the question and if somebody can help, they will :)
[10:14:45] <harsk> okay
[10:15:18] <duch_kazatel> and heed the request of the bot - don't use pastebin :)
[10:18:44] <sledgeDJ> decx: i did no suck thing to systemfault. he and i were cool
[10:20:27] <sledgeDJ> such thing
[10:21:16] <BillCriswell> lol
[10:21:41] <BillCriswell> I need a hobby away from a computer.
[10:22:53] <heedly> I see that .live has been deprecated in favor on .on, but .on doesn't seem to work for me, .live does.
[10:22:56] <heedly> howcome?
[10:23:07] <BillCriswell> heedly: Probably doing it wrong.
[10:23:34] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').live('click', function(){}); would become $(document).on('click', '.foo', function(){});
[10:23:52] <BillCriswell> document should be something closer to the element you're waiting for the event on.
[10:23:56] <BillCriswell> But document will work.
[10:24:03] <sledgeDJ> BillCriswell: can u help since decx cant?
[10:24:24] <BillCriswell> I am so busy at work right now.
[10:27:34] <duch_kazatel> sledgeDJ what's going on"?
[10:27:46] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i hear that
[10:27:59] <sledgeDJ> i am using smint ( http://www.outyear.co.uk/smint/ ) for my nav menu. problem is i have a div that changes sizes due to some other jquery script (the faq thing i was working on earlier) the problem is the when the div changes sizes smint doesnt know that the div changed sizes and it screws up the nav. is there a way to tell smint that the div size changed?
[10:28:19] <duch_kazatel> sledgeDJ can you show us an example of your stuff?
[10:28:50] <duch_kazatel> or change the .smint(); init to happen on window load instead of doc ready.
[10:29:34] <duch_kazatel> please don't PM me by the way :)_
[10:29:57] <heedly> BillCriswell: thanks, that was it.
[10:30:50] <sledgeDJ> duch_kazatel: i dont want to share my website with all. can i PM u the url?
[10:30:51] <duch_kazatel> sledgeDJ looking at the smint code, it looks like the only option is currently takes is scrollspeed.
[10:31:09] <duch_kazatel> sledgeDJ i'd really rather you didn't.  if you don't want it public, i don't want to see it ;)
[10:31:15] <duch_kazatel> i'm telling you how you'll need to fix it either way.
[10:32:07] <duch_kazatel> init smint after the code that changes the div.
[10:32:52] <sledgeDJ> it is not happening on doc ready
[10:33:04] <duch_kazatel> okay - when is it happening then?
[10:33:08] <d0de> I take the .val() of a slider and set it to localStorage. Later, I get it back from localStorage. It seems like the typeof this localStorage item is always string. Can I rely on it always being a string? What determines whether it's a string or a number? (this is probably a dumb question)
[10:33:31] <d0de> given that the val() is always a "number" in the everyday sense
[10:33:45] <BillCriswell> d0de: Always a string in localStorage
[10:33:50] <duch_kazatel> d0de iirc localstorage is string key/value pairs.
[10:34:23] <BillCriswell> My goal, this month, is to do the Netflix UI that's on my TV in AngularJS...
[10:34:31] <d0de> duch_kazatel ok cool. Basically, I want to know if the localstorage item exists. I'm using if (typeof foo === 'string') does this seem ok?
[10:34:44] <duch_kazatel> i'd test if it's defined personally.
[10:35:48] <BillCriswell> d0de: Just var val = localStorage.someName; if (val) would be plenty.
[10:36:04] <BillCriswell> If it doesn't exist val would be undefined.
[10:36:53] <d0de> Oh ok, cool, that does sound better. Also, I didn't realize I could do localStorage.myItem rather than localStorage.getItem( myItem ) ?
[10:37:21] <BillCriswell> d0de: Old IE may have an issue with the . way... You migh be better off with .getItem
[10:37:37] <d0de> BillCriswell, duch_kazatel, ok, thank you both
[10:38:57] <BillCriswell> d0de: Yeah, most places seem to user setItem and getItem over just .whatever
[10:40:55] <d0de> is there a way I can stringify everything in localStorage and dump it to the console?
[10:41:47] <hesco> duch_kazatel: do alert()'s work on jfiddle?
[10:42:11] <duch_kazatel> yes, but use console.log instead
[10:42:47] <BillCriswell> d0de: Don't think so.. It sounds like you might want to be storing an object (as a string).
[10:42:51] <duch_kazatel> d0de just dump it and use the object explorer.
[10:43:16] <BillCriswell> Ah, I was wrong lol
[10:44:25] <d0de> duch, the one in FF?
[10:44:43] <duch_kazatel> d0de firebug, chrome's dev tools, firefox's build in dev tools...
[10:44:48] <duch_kazatel> *built
[10:44:51] <duch_kazatel> they all have the,m.
[10:45:08] <hesco> thanks duch_kazatel, will try that.
[10:45:36] <BillCriswell> for( var itemName in localStorage ) { console.log(itemName); }
[10:45:38] <BillCriswell> Worked.
[10:46:28] <d0de> duch, Bill, thank you! I will explore both methods
[10:48:03] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:48:13] <duch_kazatel> sledgeDJ please don't PM me again.
[10:53:38] <hesco> I'm having trouble creating a useful selector here:  http://jsfiddle.net/34H9N/#&togetherjs=8hBtxgeBGc  Can I ask for help on my jquery at line 31, there please?  Thanks.
[10:53:50] <duch_kazatel> aaaah togetherjs
[10:53:57] <duch_kazatel> "a useful selector"
[10:54:26] <duch_kazatel> hesco btw you can't mix " and '
[10:54:44] <duch_kazatel> also: remove the tagname from in front of the ID selector.
[10:54:59] <duch_kazatel> so instead of $('div#list_options") it's $('#list_options')
[10:56:31] <BillCriswell> lol
[10:57:21] <hesco> duch_kazatel: thanks for that, but that still fails to do the trick in my tests.
[10:59:15] <d0de> I'm so grateful to this channel. My code (while still awful) is soooooo much cleaner and shorter than it used to be
[11:02:16] <BillCriswell> d0de: Nice.
[11:02:22] <duch_kazatel> :) good.
[11:02:24] <duch_kazatel> take price.
[11:02:27] <duch_kazatel> *pride
[11:02:30] <duch_kazatel> hesco see what I fixed?
[11:02:42] <duch_kazatel> looking at your console would have told you both of those issues.
[11:03:05] <hesco> yes, been watching, thanks.  about to test, locally.
[11:06:29] <duch_kazatel> togetherjs still makes me feel weird.
[11:06:59] <BillCriswell> Anything like that makes me feel weird.
[11:08:13] <decx> oh the times i had to say: "no i don't want to use teamviewer to watch code, that looks the same on my screen, on your screen instead"
[11:08:52] <duch_kazatel> right?
[11:08:54] <duch_kazatel> just weird.
[11:09:11] <duch_kazatel> and half the time i have to take the code and reformat it anyway because ugh.
[11:09:20] <duch_kazatel> hesco what value do you get out of that feature?
[11:13:22] <hesco> duch_kazatel:  the load and change are supposed to reveal the rest of the form.  the focus is supposed to demonstrate to me that I can write a working selector.
[11:13:35] <duch_kazatel> hesco huh?
[11:13:53] <duch_kazatel> "the focus is supposed to demonstrate to me that I can write a working selector." wat
[11:14:05] <duch_kazatel> oh, i was talking about the collaborate thing.
[11:14:11] <duch_kazatel> not the code you were writing.
[11:16:06] <hesco> duch_kazatel:  sorry, was distracted by a phone call and now I have to leave on an errand.  I will study this further when I return.  my apologies for that, had thought I'd be available.  so to answer, not nearly as much as I would have hoped.
[11:16:17] <duch_kazatel> okay
[11:16:20] <duch_kazatel> i am lost.
[11:16:21] <duch_kazatel> but whatevs
[11:18:34] <decx> what's up with that sentence
[11:18:39] <decx> you should go into politics
[11:19:30] <duch_kazatel> right?!  he dodged the question and crafted a nonsensical statement
[11:25:14] <BillCriswell> I wish I had that talent.
[11:28:39] <midwestward> what is the best way to toggle some kind of action when a checkbox is checked or unchecked?
[11:29:40] <marc_v92> midwestward: It depends. What kind of action are you trying to invoke?
[11:30:21] <midwestward>  currently work here checkbox checked state hides end date
[11:30:41] <midwestward> marc_v92 ^
[11:30:54] <marc_v92> midwestward: In that case, I would simply use CSS. No jQuery needed.
[11:31:23] <marc_v92> midwestward: #idOfCheckbox:checked ~ #idOfEndDate { display: none; }
[11:31:53] <BillCriswell> If they're siblings that can work.
[11:31:56] <marc_v92> midwestward: However, this will not work in <= IE 8. If you're planning to support older versions of IE, then I would use the toggleClass() method.
[11:31:57] <shoky> assuming they're siblings
[11:32:13] <marc_v92> BillCriswell, shoky: Yes, if they are siblings. Sorry, forgot to mention that. :)
[11:36:38] <Dirkos> I have a element and why i call .index() on it, it gives me the weirdes values ever
[11:36:44] <Dirkos> even though it is inside a parent div
[11:37:00] <Dirkos> 0 / 12 / 20 / 24 / 25/ 57
[11:37:41] <midwestward> thanks marc_v92, shoky, BillCriswell
[11:37:58] <marc_v92> midwestward: No worries.
[11:53:28] <[ZiP]> duch_kazatel you still here?
[11:53:39] <[ZiP]> would you be willing to write this validator for me if I paid you?
[11:54:05] <[ZiP]> Ive been focusing on it for 5 and half hours now to no avail
[11:55:45] <[ZiP]> $50 payable tomorrow to anyone that could assist me with validating one text field upon form submission with jQuery
[11:57:14] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: Can you show me your code? Don't want your money but would like to help you figure it out.
[11:59:49] <[ZiP]> BillCriswell absolutely
[12:00:04] <[ZiP]> its for this form https://a.pgtb.me/qKflSN?embed=1
[12:00:37] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[12:00:54] <[ZiP]> if you view source my code is just under the wrapper
[12:01:09] <[ZiP]> this is a ShortStackApp.com form my co worker setup
[12:01:30] <[ZiP]> we need to validate it so if you enter wrong number in the surfboards box it doesnt submit and notifies you thats incorrect
[12:01:42] <[ZiP]> the correct number should be 12 and if thats entered it should submit
[12:01:57] <[ZiP]> this is driving me up a wall I usually just work with PHP not much JS
[12:02:26] <litropy> Is there a way to check if an element exists without throwing a ReferenceError if the element doesn't exist? I'm counting elements with a simpe count++, and throwing a ReferenceError makes count null. Granted, I can do a separate function per element count, capturing null and handling it, but it would be nice to count in one:  var count = page.evaluate(function() { ... });
[12:03:15] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: IS the rest of the form currently validating and you'd like to integrate it with that or would something one off be ok?
[12:03:42] <[ZiP]> Bill yes the form already has vallidation that was setup from ShortStackApp.com I have no control over it
[12:03:52] <shoky> litropy: huh? what element are you looking for
[12:03:53] <[ZiP]> I do have the ability to add a CODE widget and my own JS
[12:04:04] <[ZiP]> so I need to do that to check the number of surfboards box
[12:04:12] <[ZiP]> but I couldnt do this to save my life right now
[12:04:18] <[ZiP]> hoping I dont get fired
[12:04:22] <[ZiP]> this is due tomorrow
[12:04:59] <aboudreault> what's the proper way to use jquery-cookie for a domain:port ?
[12:05:32] <[ZiP]> Bill Im interested in anyway possible at all to validate it just so long as it works
[12:06:01] <cek> jquery-ujs for rails, where do i ask?
[12:07:09] <harsk> i'm using this script to check if a domain is valid - http://pastebin.com/a1LN2afB - How can I check if the actual domain is valid in an if statement?
[12:07:11] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: http://jsbin.com/hihaxuvi/1/edit?html,js,output This should theoretically work.
[12:07:35] <BillCriswell> Instead of e.preventDefault() you could put in alert saying "Wrong number of surfboards."
[12:07:41] <harsk> The 4 - 5 lines at the end are what I want to use if the domain is valid
[12:07:50] <NoiseEee> harsk: not that way
[12:07:55] <NoiseEee> harsk: what about all the new domains?
[12:08:02] <NoiseEee> harsk: doit.guru is totally valid
[12:08:09] <NoiseEee> why do you care if a domain is valid, harsk?
[12:08:22] <cek> The issue I have is that data-method links aren't meant to be AJAX-y,
[12:08:28] <harsk> I'm using them in a hosting service
[12:08:36] <NoiseEee> harsk: what does that mean
[12:08:37] <[ZiP]> awesome thanks Bill! I'm testing it now
[12:08:46] <harsk> I'm using them with the WHMCS API
[12:09:00] <harsk> I need them to be valid to add them to a user account
[12:09:05] <NoiseEee> harsk: well im not sure what that is, but your 'acceptable domain' list is incomplete, wrong, and will always change
[12:09:24] <litropy> Nevermind - this works: if(document.querySelector("#myId") != null){ count++ }
[12:09:26] <BillCriswell> I love validating against things that always change.
[12:09:27] <harsk> Sure, I don't expect people with those odd tlds to sign up to my service, however
[12:09:37] <NoiseEee> harsk: attempt to connect to the domain on the backend harsk
[12:09:52] <NoiseEee> harsk: also thats a ridiculous statement, "I don't expect people with those odd tlds to sign up to my service"
[12:09:58] <BillCriswell> harsk: So fuck them right?
[12:10:10] <NoiseEee> harsk: there's been like 50+ new tlds added over the past two months alone
[12:10:17] <harsk> Lol, you're not very well informed about my service
[12:10:21] <harsk> So stop making stupid assumptions
[12:10:37] <shoky> he was only assuming what you asked for
[12:10:44] <shoky> "domain is valid"
[12:10:53] <harsk> Sure, I have a list clearly stated in the script
[12:11:05] <harsk> That's all I wanted to check through
[12:11:20] <[ZiP]> Bill didn't work but I might have to load the validator right
[12:11:26] <[ZiP]> or link it rather I mean
[12:11:35] <[ZiP]> this code will need validator right?
[12:11:46] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: That wouldn't require any type of script besides jQuery.
[12:12:08] <[ZiP]> Oh ok so just link the latest jQuery library and try again you think?
[12:12:38] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: Yes.
[12:13:58] <[ZiP]> still doesnt work
[12:14:21] <[ZiP]> any other ideas Bill?
[12:14:48] <decx> put it in a document ready wrapper
[12:15:36] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: decx has a good point. Try this instead: http://jsbin.com/hihaxuvi/2/edit?js
[12:17:53] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: THere's just too much that could be going on without me knowing.
[12:20:08] <[ZiP]> ok thanks Bill Ill try the second one now
[12:21:07] <decx> it's appended right after #wrapper, jquery gets loaded already in the head in tabserving.js
[12:21:35] <decx> they also use validate, i don't know if you can extend validate rules
[12:21:59] <[ZiP]> nope that didn't do it either Im starting to think this is because of this stupid ShortStackApp.com form
[12:22:23] <[ZiP]> I wonder if I rebuilt it on our server if it would work with that code but I really dont have any time
[12:22:44] <[ZiP]> Im supposed to iframe this form into our site once the error checking works
[12:23:05] <[ZiP]> I think im going to have to tell marketing its not possible unfortunately
[12:23:35] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: Can you pretty enter and skip validation on that entire form?
[12:23:37] <BillCriswell> press*
[12:24:14] <BillCriswell> I notive there's an onclick on the submit button, maybe you could try this: http://jsbin.com/hihaxuvi/4/edit instead.
[12:24:21] <BillCriswell> Well "submit button"
[12:24:25] <[ZiP]> no you cant
[12:24:27] <BillCriswell> That's just a link.
[12:24:30] <[ZiP]> it validates the other fields
[12:24:41] <BillCriswell> Ah ok. Then I don't know. That's annoying.
[12:24:55] <[ZiP]> if I just hit submit it says This field is required next to them all
[12:25:38] <[ZiP]> I'm going to email the shortstackapp.com support and ask why it doesn't work before I give up I guess
[12:25:44] <[ZiP]> see if they reply
[12:27:22] <decx> can you get anything from that submit function?
[12:27:51] <[ZiP]> No nothing just the shortstackapp.com validation is working
[12:28:00] <decx> like if (numberOfSurfboards !== "12") { console.log('not 12') }
[12:28:03] <decx> and then check console
[12:28:07] <[ZiP]> Ive yet to get anything at all to display from my custom code'
[12:28:16] <decx> maybe prevent default doesnt cut it
[12:28:19] <[ZiP]> ok ill try that
[12:30:42] <[ZiP]> still nothing
[12:30:54] <[ZiP]> thats nothing at all in the console
[12:30:59] <[ZiP]> blank
[12:31:05] <sledgeDJ> already asked this... looking for some help please.. i am using smint ( http://www.outyear.co.uk/smint/ ) for my nav menu. problem is i have a div that changes sizes due to some other jquery script (the faq thing i was working on earlier) the problem is the when the div changes sizes smint doesnt know that the div changed sizes and it screws up the nav. is there a way to tell smint that the div size changed?
[12:31:50] <decx> numberOfSurfboards [ZiP]
[12:31:55] <decx> ReferenceError: numberOfSurfboards is not defined
[12:32:26] <decx> you just copied that one line :o
[12:32:28] <[ZiP]> thats because I took the original code out and added just athat one line
[12:32:34] <[ZiP]> wrong?
[12:33:04] <sledgeDJ> ok ok  not all at once
[12:33:08] <decx> you need the document ready function, the declaration of that variable and probably something else
[12:33:15] <[ZiP]> ok putting it back now with that line
[12:33:42] <[ZiP]> Im not even kidding if someone got this working like yourself or Bill Id gladly send over $50 via PayPal tomorrow when i get paid
[12:34:15] <[ZiP]> Im going to be overdue and questioned about it etc if its not live
[12:36:13] <BillCriswell> [ZiP]: That's really all we can do from here.
[12:37:06] <[ZiP]> still getting that numberOfSurfboards is not defined
[12:37:47] <decx> you left it above the ready function
[12:37:51] <decx> ;)
[12:37:51] <[ZiP]> so how would that be definied var numberOfSurfboards = input.promotion_field_1
[12:38:36] <[ZiP]> but there isnt a document.ready function in the custom code where I'm putting this
[12:38:39] <jeebster> any recommendations for a great endless scrolling library?
[12:39:03] <decx> $(function() is a shortcut for that [ZiP] if i copy that page manually it works
[12:39:12] <decx> locally*
[12:39:58] <decx> like this http://paste2.org/wnCpyDJ1
[12:40:05] <[ZiP]> fixed the error but checking still fails form just submits
[12:40:29] <decx> yes, so that part works
[12:40:35] <decx> it's saying not 12
[12:41:12] <[ZiP]> ok just replaced my code with that new one you supplied
[12:41:17] <[ZiP]> here goes testing again
[12:41:31] <[ZiP]> is it really? in the console then, let me look
[12:41:49] <decx> and if it's 12 it doesn't say not 12
[12:42:02] <decx> so you successfully added a function to that form validation
[12:42:57] <luist> hey guys‚Ä¶ i load an html with an iframe. how can i insert some code into the head of this html using jquery?
[12:43:11] <[ZiP]> it doesnt say anything for me in console or on page
[12:43:19] <[ZiP]> other than successful post 200
[12:43:25] <[ZiP]> with the wrong number in there
[12:44:21] <decx> what console are you looking at?
[12:44:40] <[ZiP]> Firefox, Firebug, Console Tab, ALL
[12:44:51] <[ZiP]> should I try chrome
[12:44:53] <[ZiP]> let me do that
[12:45:41] <decx> yeah prevent default doesn't work
[12:45:53] <[ZiP]> ok yeah chrome console way better
[12:45:58] <decx> maybe do return false;
[12:46:08] <[ZiP]> its telling me right off the bad event.returnValue is deprecated
[12:47:04] <[ZiP]> so change e.preventDefault(); to return false; ?
[12:47:11] <decx> yes
[12:47:16] <[ZiP]> k thanks
[12:47:24] <duch_kazatel> woah what?
[12:47:27] <decx> otherwise i'm out of options
[12:47:52] <decx> maybe move your validation from form submit to input change
[12:47:57] <decx> that'll do it
[12:48:12] <apajo> hi
[12:48:16] <apajo> i need to specify key code and event target to jQuery.Event but somewhy when i specify them, the event wont get triggered anymore -> http://pastebin.com/VrHWtwqB
[12:50:59] <ankurk_> apajo: please provide a fiddle
[12:52:12] <[ZiP]> so would I do on('input.change' instead of on('submit' dec ?
[12:53:08] <decx> [ZiP] http://paste2.org/y3LDDCLV
[12:53:51] <decx> now nothing can be written instead of 12, and we delete anything else to trigger the built in validator
[12:58:11] <[ZiP]> thanks decx trying it now
[12:59:46] <[ZiP]> nope just submits the form
[12:59:55] <[ZiP]> with wrong number in there post 200 ok in console
[13:00:09] <[ZiP]> be right back need to address quick seperate issue
[13:01:36] <decx> you didnt change anything
[13:03:27] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:08:11] <pecanha> Hello, how can I check if an array element exists? like exploded[1] ?
[13:08:18] <prawnsalad> hello. when using ui draggable, is there a way to do soemthing similar to $(document).draggable('.draggable-ui'... so its not binding events on many elements
[13:08:49] <prawnsalad> pecanha: typeof explode[1] === 'undefined'
[13:09:44] <BillCriswell> pecanha: You can use $.indexOf() to see if a particular element exists in the whole array. I Think that's more what you want to do?
[13:10:12] <pecanha> prawnsalad: I tried if($exploded[1] === '' OR typeof explode[1] === 'undefined')  but it didn't work.
[13:10:22] <decx> /r/babyelephantgifs
[13:10:34] <pecanha> BillCriswell: How can I use it?
[13:10:36] <duch_kazatel> "an array element exists" that smells to me.
[13:11:15] <pecanha> I could have that element or not dynamically, so I need to work with it
[13:11:31] <duch_kazatel> that array element?  couldn't you just check length?
[13:11:49] <BillCriswell> pecanha: Like... $.inArray([1,3,6,7,8], 3) since 3 is in that array it would return 1...
[13:12:13] <BillCriswell> pecanha: Are you checking to see if a particular thing exists in it or if anything exists inside it?
[13:12:34] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/N8ZbM/
[13:12:41] <BillCriswell> pecanha: $.inArray(3, [1,3,6,7,8],) *** I had the arguments reversed.
[13:12:54] <duch_kazatel> or http://jsfiddle.net/N8ZbM/1/
[13:13:05] <duch_kazatel> also: what do you call a gaggle of pedants?  an "actually".
[13:13:25] <BillCriswell> Don't even know what a pedants is.
[13:13:51] <pecanha> BillCriswell: My scenario is: I have a form field which contains the name of person, if it types Pecanha Something, then I'm spliting variable like .split(" "), then I have exploded[0] and exploded[1] and I get those results and paste on another input field.
[13:13:51] <duch_kazatel> "a person who is excessively concerned with minor details and rules or with displaying academic learning."
[13:14:28] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What's the opposite of that? I am the opposite of that?
[13:14:41] <pecanha> BillCriswell: But if the user types Pecanha, I'll get pecanha.undefined because exploded[1] doesn't exists
[13:14:43] <duch_kazatel> you're a solid dude.
[13:14:53] <BillCriswell> Niiiiice.
[13:14:57] <duch_kazatel> pecanha so you want to see if a field contains spaces?
[13:15:18] <pecanha> I need to see if the exploded[1] was created
[13:15:34] <prawnsalad> explode[1] !== undefined
[13:15:48] <BillCriswell> pecanha: You have a first and last name field, right?
[13:16:07] <pecanha> BillCriswell: No, I have one field which contains both
[13:16:19] <BillCriswell> Yes, but you're splitting them up to do something?
[13:16:23] <pecanha> yes
[13:16:43] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/KMBcm/
[13:16:53] <duch_kazatel> i'd make two separate fields: firstname and lastname
[13:17:20] <decx> one convention i don't agree with
[13:17:47] <duch_kazatel> hah
[13:17:50] <decx> same with street/nr and city/number
[13:17:57] <decx> whatever it'S called
[13:18:00] <decx> postleitzahl :>
[13:18:12] <duch_kazatel> postal code.
[13:18:13] <pecanha> duch_kazatel: I just thinks its waste of time :p
[13:18:15] <decx> right
[13:18:35] <duch_kazatel> we have to worry about that sort of stuff here for credit card purposes.
[13:18:37] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/deziruxu/1/edit?js,output Weeeee
[13:18:57] <decx> but what about strange names or addresses
[13:19:10] <duch_kazatel> in the US you rarely have those.
[13:19:11] <decx> i say one field for every type of information snippet
[13:19:14] <BillCriswell> decx: Forget those people they're stupid!
[13:19:26] <duch_kazatel> otherwise we can't really accept credit cards.
[13:20:06] <pecanha> prawnsalad: something like this? 	if($exploded[1] === '' OR $explode[1] !== undefined) {
[13:20:07] <BillCriswell> decx: I prefer just one field as well. It could make searching suck a bit.
[13:20:30] <decx> i just had to align to many forms :)
[13:20:32] <decx> too
[13:20:36] <pecanha> sorry, 	if($exploded[1] === '' OR $explode[1] === undefined)
[13:20:53] <duch_kazatel> pecanha did you see what I just pasted?
[13:21:02] <duch_kazatel> err, woops
[13:21:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/KMBcm/1/
[13:21:12] <pecanha> duch_kazatel: minute
[13:22:21] <pecanha> duch_kazatel: using null?
[13:22:42] <duch_kazatel> with type coercion.  the only case where i'm fine with that.
[13:22:43] <BillCriswell> If you're filling out an input you don't have to worry: http://jsbin.com/deziruxu/2/edit
[13:22:52] <duch_kazatel> you could also do !== undefined instead.
[13:24:15] <pecanha> please, take a look: http://jsfiddle.net/AzQ8u/
[13:24:47] <duch_kazatel> pecanha can you give us some html for this, too?
[13:24:54] <duch_kazatel> wait lines 7 and 8...
[13:25:16] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn javascript or
[13:25:17] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: JavaScript | MDN ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
[13:25:24] <duch_kazatel> hrm
[13:25:53] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn logical operators
[13:25:54] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Logical Operators - JavaScript | MDN ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators
[13:25:55] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[13:26:02] <duch_kazatel> you want ||, not OR
[13:26:25] <pecanha> hmmm
[13:26:29] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/AzQ8u/1/
[13:27:25] <decx> btw http://symbolhound.com
[13:28:02] <pecanha> still not working, just when I use  || $explode[1] === undefined
[13:28:46] <duch_kazatel> decx that doesn't help when you're using the word OR.
[13:29:35] <duch_kazatel> pecanha use this: http://jsfiddle.net/AzQ8u/3/
[13:29:51] <duch_kazatel> copy/paste that - if that doesn't work, could you share your HTML?
[13:29:54] <decx> true, but it's pretty neat and i wanted to share ;)
[13:30:10] <duch_kazatel> pecanha $("#login").attr('value', " "); - use .val() instead.
[13:30:41] <pecanha> duch_kazatel: yes, I tried exactly that. Do you mean the form?
[13:30:50] <duch_kazatel> pecanha yeah.
[13:31:30] <duch_kazatel> pecanha and finally - $exploded[1] === '' || $explode[1] === undefined
[13:31:34] <duch_kazatel> see the issue?
[13:32:40] <pecanha> duch_kazatel: sorry I didn't
[13:32:46] <pecanha> ah
[13:32:48] <pecanha> ok
[13:32:49] <pecanha> lol
[13:32:51] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:33:05] <duch_kazatel> drop that preceding $ btw.  that var holds a string, not a jquery object.
[13:33:56] <pecanha> thanks dude
[13:34:10] <duch_kazatel> fixing stuff for you even more.
[13:34:59] <pecanha> thank you guys
[13:36:16] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/AzQ8u/5/
[13:36:19] <duch_kazatel> embrace the curlies.
[13:36:59] <decx> quality wordplay
[13:37:35] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:37:48] <duch_kazatel> like a kid with polio
[13:38:05] <duch_kazatel> too much?
[13:38:24] <decx> you're ruining the moment here
[13:38:30] <decx> _>
[13:39:31] <[ZiP]> ok Im back and I saw your message sayiung I didnt change anything so I'll double check and make sure my code matches http://paste2.org/y3LDDCLV
[13:42:10] <[ZiP]> WOW
[13:42:21] <[ZiP]> decx thank you thank you we are getting super close now!
[13:42:41] <[ZiP]> now if you enter anything but 12 in there it clears it out of there once you click outside of the input box
[13:42:49] <[ZiP]> is there a wa to also include a message easily?
[13:42:56] <[ZiP]> when it's wrong
[13:43:15] <[ZiP]> If I get that then this is done! Thank you so much you saved my life :-)
[13:43:16] <decx> give me the link again i accidently closed the channel earlier
[13:43:28] <[ZiP]> https://a.pgtb.me/qKflSN?embed=1
[13:43:31] <[ZiP]> thats the form
[13:43:39] <[ZiP]> http://paste2.org/y3LDDCLV
[13:43:45] <[ZiP]> thats the code thats working
[13:43:54] <[ZiP]> just need a message stating WRONG TRY AGAIN
[13:44:12] <[ZiP]> unless its 12 of course
[13:49:50] <decx> http://paste2.org/gXg69nf9
[13:50:14] <ankurk_> long weekend yayy!
[13:51:39] <[ZiP]> decx brilliant my friend!
[13:51:47] <[ZiP]> that is it works like a charm
[13:51:53] <decx> na it's still buggy
[13:52:01] <decx> try adding multiple wrong tries
[13:52:11] <alxy> Mh, I'm having again issues with scopes, and variables in javascript/jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/aZ3Gp/
[13:52:11] <[ZiP]> yeah theres that
[13:52:17] <[ZiP]> it will stack up the its not 12 lines
[13:52:28] <[ZiP]> That's ok though I think
[13:52:29] <alxy> why does my function only return the html from the last looping
[13:52:30] <alxy> ?
[13:52:41] <[ZiP]> unless you have an easy fix for that
[13:52:42] <decx> [ZiP] http://paste2.org/9Pm2UkhO
[13:53:53] <[ZiP]> ok sweet much better
[13:53:57] <decx> i would have just bullshitted marketing that you'd get better conversions if you include all the idiots who can't count but that's me
[13:54:15] <[ZiP]> hahaha nice!
[13:55:09] <[ZiP]> Only issue now is trivial and I can even fix it myself :-) that is its required field so the existing error checking kicks in and it says Its not 12 then if you submit again it says its not 12 and This field is requjired
[13:55:21] <[ZiP]> I think i'll take off the required field for that one
[13:55:39] <[ZiP]> because if they leave it blank then it will stay say It's not 12 so perfect
[13:57:15] <d0de> does anyone else get a bit of a shiver when things start to work? it seems like magic
[13:59:45] <decx> that's the dopamine kicking in when you stand in smug awe and think: "i did something!"
[14:00:05] <mechamjoseph> hey guys, i‚Äôm trying to combine click or mousedown + mousemove and i can‚Äôt seem to make it happen. any ideas? http://codepad.org/t7oQWIG6
[14:01:42] <d0de> I don't understand how the clickstatus will ever be true on mousemove
[14:02:01] <decx> use mousedown instead of click
[14:02:19] <d0de> or at all. If a click is mousedown+mouseup, and you're binding false to mouseup
[14:02:33] <mechamjoseph> ok let me try that
[14:02:54] <mechamjoseph> yeah still no result
[14:02:56] <decx> and add mouseout
[14:02:57] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4uEbz/
[14:03:32] <[ZiP]> d0de I hear you yes! Im so fricking happy now that my error checking is working (thanks to decx)
[14:04:20] <duch_kazatel> hey i helped topo ;)
[14:04:21] <duch_kazatel> *too
[14:04:48] <d0de> I think I have yet to see a question in this channel you haven't helped with duch ^_^ we are all very grateful!
[14:05:00] <[ZiP]> yeah you did sorry duch_kazatel :-)
[14:05:06] <duch_kazatel> nah it's all good.
[14:05:07] <[ZiP]> big thanks to both of you!
[14:05:08] <duch_kazatel> i'm a wiseass anyway.
[14:05:09] <mechamjoseph> that did the trick you guys! thank you! decx what is the mouseout for?
[14:05:14] <duch_kazatel> decx is the man imo.
[14:05:20] <duch_kazatel> and BillSriswell
[14:05:25] <d0de> mechamjoseph http://api.jquery.com/mouseout/
[14:05:27] <duch_kazatel> err BillCriswell
[14:05:28] <[ZiP]> yeah thank you too Bill
[14:05:35] <[ZiP]> everyone thank you!
[14:06:01] <[ZiP]> Ok better close this ticket now :-)
[14:06:07] <[ZiP]> and finish up my work day
[14:06:11] <[ZiP]> cheers everyone
[14:06:18] <decx> mechamjoseph mouseout makes sure it resets the variable when you leave the element
[14:07:33] <decx> i'm on a roll today duch_kazatel where's that DJ guy and joop8
[14:07:38] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:07:39] <d0de> this is a little off topic but does anyone know the oldest/cheapest Apple hardware I could buy that can run xcode decently?
[14:07:39] <decx> or whatever it was
[14:10:06] <d0de> Hrm. Given a slider value (e.g. 0.62), can anyone think of positioning an element at that spot in CSS without moving the slider handle or changing the value of the slider?
[14:10:41] <d0de> e.g. if the slider goes from 0 to 1 and the handle and value are 0.5, is there I way I could put something on the slider track at 0.75?
[14:11:04] <d0de> I guess like right: 25% ?
[14:14:35] <hesco> if I click in a div, should not that trigger a focus event?
[14:15:22] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:15:26] <duch_kazatel> divs don't support focus.
[14:16:12] <hesco> only form elements, I guess.  so if I click on a radio button, should that event bubble up to the containing div?
[14:16:58] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/on/#additional-notes
[14:17:06] <duch_kazatel> "The focus and blur events are specified by the W3C to not bubble, but jQuery defines cross-browser focusin and focusout events that do bubble."
[14:17:18] <duch_kazatel> keep reading.
[14:17:31] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to detect when a radio is clicked?
[14:31:06] <hesco> duch_kazatel: yes, trying to detect when a radio is clicked
[14:32:10] <duch_kazatel> hesco why not use the change event instead?
[14:32:17] <duch_kazatel> .on('change', function(){});
[14:32:25] <hesco> ok, will try that
[14:35:33] <hesco> duch_kazatel:  THANKS!!!  was starting to feel a bit crazy there.
[14:35:44] <duch_kazatel> hesco of course.  that's the smarter event anyway.
[14:43:20] <hesco> last item on my punch list is to make it evaluate those radio buttons and to run that same event handler if one of them is checked on load, to account for rejection of form submission by server -side data validation.
[14:56:48] <d0de> If I use a var to store a reference to an element that doesn't exist yet, then I create it, the var won't refer to the element will it? Because it didn't exist when the var was created
[14:57:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:57:10] <duch_kazatel> like a jquery selector?
[14:57:17] <d0de> yes, a jquery selector
[14:57:25] <duch_kazatel> in that case, it won't "update.
[14:57:26] <duch_kazatel> "
[14:57:32] <d0de> cool, thanks
[14:57:41] <duch_kazatel> that would be caching the function call.
[15:07:13] <blue_warlock> hi
[15:07:27] <blue_warlock> is there a way to trigger multiple functions on resize ?
[15:07:37] <blue_warlock> $(window).on('resize', onload).trigger('resize');
[15:07:57] <blue_warlock> i have this one onload() but need to load another one
[15:08:03] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock trigger ON multiple functions, or trigger a few different functions?
[15:08:45] <blue_warlock> trigger different functions on resize
[15:09:27] <duch_kazatel> what code looks odd...
[15:09:33] <duch_kazatel> why are you triggering reside on reside?
[15:10:11] <blue_warlock> because it must be loaded on document ready , and on resize also
[15:10:32] <duch_kazatel> $(window).on('resize', onload).trigger('resize'); - this makes very little sense.
[15:10:35] <blue_warlock> the only way it works is that method
[15:10:55] <duch_kazatel> triggering a resize on resize is indicatve of larger problems.
[15:11:25] <duch_kazatel> either way, i think you can chain triggers iirc.
[15:12:10] <blue_warlock> hum
[15:12:39] <blue_warlock> i have alr discussed about that in this channel Bill told me to do it
[15:12:52] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:12:53] <duch_kazatel> okay
[15:13:00] <blue_warlock> and it is working anyway
[15:13:22] <duch_kazatel> lol "it's working" is one of the worst things ever
[15:16:16] <oniMaker> If I have click handlers on a parent element and one of its child elements, which should fire first?
[15:16:25] <oniMaker> I'd like the child to fire first, but the parent handler is first
[15:18:10] <duch_kazatel> parent than child iirc.
[15:18:47] <oniMaker> ok, so I'd have to check e.target in the parent handler then?
[15:18:56] <oniMaker> to know if I should skip handling etc
[15:19:07] <duch_kazatel> or $(this)
[15:19:40] <oniMaker> duch_kazatel: wouldn't $(this) be set to the parent element?
[15:20:55] <duch_kazatel> oniMaker $(this) is whatever element triggered the handler
[15:21:02] <duch_kazatel> in the delegated listener, that'd be the child.
[15:23:12] <oniMaker> duch_kazatel: when the parent was binding straight onto the elements it would fire first
[15:23:16] <d0de> good night everyone
[15:23:23] <oniMaker> duch_kazatel: now that the parent is delegated like the child, the child fires first
[15:23:39] <duch_kazatel> oniMaker huh?  could you paste some code up on jsfiddle?
[15:25:45] <oniMaker> duch_kazatel: you do the fiddle, I'll finish this up
[15:25:55] <duch_kazatel> wut?
[15:26:00] <duch_kazatel> how can i fiddle your code for you?
[15:26:10] <oniMaker> you have the description...
[15:26:27] <duch_kazatel> ... i'm asking for the fiddle because i am not clear about what you are doing.
[15:26:52] <oniMaker> binding click to a parent and a child for different things
[15:26:58] <oniMaker> the child was always using delegation
[15:27:04] <duch_kazatel> right - i want to see what you are doing in your case.
[15:27:10] <oniMaker> when the parent was binding without delegation, it fired first when clicking on the child
[15:27:22] <oniMaker> when I changed the parent to use delegation, it fired second when clicking on the child
[15:27:31] <duch_kazatel> all right dude.
[15:27:49] <oniMaker> so you fiddle that up and let me know when it's ready
[15:27:56] <duch_kazatel> no thanks.
[15:28:00] <oniMaker> ok, same here
[15:28:00] <duch_kazatel> i'm not doing that for you.
[15:28:11] <duch_kazatel> don't understand why you're resistant to providing an example?
[15:28:16] <oniMaker> why are you?
[15:28:20] <oniMaker> same thing
[15:28:27] <duch_kazatel> because i don't know what your code looks like.
[15:28:34] <duch_kazatel> i don't know that you are doing things correctly.
[15:28:49] <oniMaker> even more reason to show me with a fine fiddle
[15:29:03] <duch_kazatel> what the hell?
[15:30:50] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/23vBA/
[15:30:53] <duch_kazatel> all right htere you go.
[15:30:59] <duch_kazatel> plain and deleagted listeners.
[15:30:59] <duch_kazatel> yw
[15:32:20] <oniMaker> duch_kazatel: so the child fires first
[15:32:29] <duch_kazatel> sure,.
[15:32:38] <duch_kazatel> dunno what your code looks like.
[15:32:56] <oniMaker> just like that
[15:33:09] <duch_kazatel> sure cool glad i could help.
[15:33:18] <oniMaker> you're welcome
[15:33:31] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:34:58] <duch_kazatel> why do people come in here, ask a question, become shitty when you ask for a code sample, and then continue to be rude after you do their homework for them?
[15:35:48] * oniMaker hugs duch_kazatel
[15:35:52] <oniMaker> I think you're ok.
[15:38:13] <tudda> what just happened. lol.
[15:39:13] <duch_kazatel> whatever.
[15:40:35] <oniMaker> he wanted to be mad
[15:56:00] <House> hello everyone, im having trouble using $('.div') on elements that have been appended on original DOM ? Any idea how/what to use instead of $ ?
[16:00:26] <oniMaker> House: you want a div element or something with a class="div" ?
[16:02:48] <House> oniMaker, i have >http://paste.ee/p/0CW2s but it wont work if the new element with class .song_click is added by ajax
[16:03:11] <oniMaker> House: when does that code run?
[16:03:12] <oniMaker> on load?
[16:03:37] <House> on click evet, its out of page load
[16:03:45] <House> docment ready
[16:03:58] <oniMaker> right, so it only binds to .song_link elements already on the page
[16:04:02] <oniMaker> the solution is delegation
[16:04:03] <blindMoe> House: as a test try $('body').on('click', '.song_link', function() { ... } );
[16:04:12] <oniMaker> ^ what blindMoe said
[16:04:15] <oniMaker> tha'ts delegation
[16:04:21] <decx> your script only runs once on load, you have to delegate your event from an item that exists at that point eg $('parent').on('click','.new',function)
[16:04:32] <House> thank you
[16:04:33] <oniMaker> House: make 'body' into whatever element contains the .song_links
[16:04:34] <decx> body is ok but the closest parent is best
[16:04:38] <oniMaker> right
[16:04:48] <House> oniMaker, blindMoe, ill try
[16:07:16] <House> Works like a charm, Thank you :)
[16:07:37] <tachy0n> can someone give me an idea for how to solve this issue I've been having.. window.onblur or onfocus seems to fire for a variety of cases I don't want
[16:08:32] <tachy0n> the only one I really care about is if a browser has tab focus change.. there is a swf this matters to and click on or outside of swf without changing tabs changes the focus/blur states
[16:52:58] <sledgeDJ> ok i have a new problem when i scroll the page down the nav manu floats to the top of the page. it is supposed t stay where it is under the curtain until u scroll to that point at that point it should become fixed to the top. now idead why that is happening.... here is the site... http://www.mindshtick.com/curtains/?c=b
[16:53:06] <sledgeDJ> PLease someone help me with this
[16:53:59] <duch_kazatel> help us brobi-wan kenbrobi.  you're our only hope.
[16:54:06] <sledgeDJ> exactly
[16:54:07] <sledgeDJ> lol
[16:54:24] <sledgeDJ> any ideas?
[16:54:29] <duch_kazatel> *our bronly help.
[16:54:31] <duch_kazatel> eyoo.
[16:54:53] <duch_kazatel> you mean it fixes too early?
[16:55:00] <sledgeDJ> correct
[16:55:16] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're running the init before the content is fully rendered.
[16:57:09] <sledgeDJ> u r right
[16:57:15] <sledgeDJ> that ws part of the issue
[16:57:21] <sledgeDJ> now it is doing other weird things
[17:03:40] <BillCriswell> I hope my girlfriend brings home chipotle.
[17:06:49] <duch_kazatel> oooh.
[17:06:51] <duch_kazatel> that'd be good.
[17:08:28] <BillCriswell> Aw yeah.
[17:11:39] <duch_kazatel> welp i just did a code fix for the CEO this is kind of scary.
[17:11:53] <BillCriswell> Did you tell them they're stupid
[17:12:45] <BillCriswell> I'm watching West Wing... I am not sure I have the IQ for this.
[17:12:53] <duch_kazatel> oh i love this show.
[17:12:57] <duch_kazatel> *that
[17:13:17] <duch_kazatel> sorkin's writing is fantastic.  you'll like it.
[17:13:28] <BillCriswell> Three episodes in right now.
[17:13:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you're still getting acquainted with that world.
[17:14:29] <Fraz> hi
[17:14:47] <Fraz> how would i go about detecting if an element was clicked?
[17:14:53] <duch_kazatel> .on()
[17:15:10] <Fraz> i want to make the element dissapear when you click anywhere but on that element
[17:15:18] <Fraz> hmm
[17:15:21] <duch_kazatel> easy.
[17:15:25] <duch_kazatel> does that element have an ID?
[17:15:31] <Fraz> yes
[17:16:08] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('click', '*:not('#id')', function(){});
[17:16:11] <duch_kazatel> or something like that.
[17:16:40] <BillCriswell> I think you would need to do $(this).closest('#id').length
[17:17:17] <BillCriswell> (I imagine #id has children)
[17:17:51] <Fraz> it dies
[17:17:54] <Fraz> err
[17:17:56] <Fraz> it does*
[17:18:02] <BillCriswell> Holy shit dude that's hardcore.
[17:18:02] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[17:18:07] <Fraz> lol
[17:18:09] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[17:18:11] <duch_kazatel> are you drinking?
[17:18:17] <BillCriswell> No, unfortunately.
[17:18:30] <BillCriswell> I should try to keep better beer in my apartment.
[17:18:54] <duch_kazatel> 100% agree.
[17:18:58] <duch_kazatel> beer fridge imo
[17:20:51] <duch_kazatel> i need to restock mine.
[17:22:39] <BillCriswell> Fraz: http://jsbin.com/juwehuju/1/edit?js,output is what I was thinking.
[17:22:57] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I need some founders centennial.
[17:24:24] <BillCriswell> Uh oh, pericles one.
[17:26:24] <duch_kazatel> what you really need is to go to the sierra nevada barrel aging facility
[17:27:41] <BillCriswell> One of the best answers I've ever read: http://stackoverflow.com/a/20613879/191226
[17:28:02] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:28:11] <duch_kazatel> you've seen the regex on html one right?
[17:28:38] <BillCriswell> I think so. Doesn't it just break in the middle of the answer or something?
[17:28:45] <duch_kazatel> zalgo
[17:29:05] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/923919
[17:30:24] <BillCriswell> Yeah this is the one haha.
[17:31:11] <BillCriswell> "This post has been locked while disputes about its content are being resolved." What?
[17:39:38] <aboudreault> emm.. I'm playing with jquery-cookie..... but will a $.cookie({domain: 'hello.com'}) be accepted if the window.location is localhost:8000 ?
[17:44:49] <BillCriswell> aboudreault: Nope.
[17:45:12] <Fraz> $(':not(#someid)').bind('click', function(e) {console.log('hello');}); << still logs when i click on #someid
[17:45:14] <Fraz> arrghh
[17:45:51] <shoky> because it's bubbling up, probably. don't do that
[17:46:14] <Fraz> so what should i do?
[17:46:15] <shoky> that adds an event handler to every element in the DOM (except #someid)
[17:46:27] <BillCriswell> Fraz: http://jsbin.com/juwehuju/1/edit?js,output
[17:46:32] <Fraz> yeh a bit inefficient:S
[17:46:54] <com4> I'm trying to read the value of a textbox when a button is clicked. I have the textbox, it's id is #id_name. When I load the page, change the textbox, click the button $("#id_name").val() shows me the default/original value always. What do I need to do to get the changed value of the input?
[17:47:21] <Fraz> thanks BillCriswell
[17:48:04] <shoky> Fraz: what BillCriswell showed. or with stopPropagation http://jsbin.com/juwehuju/3/edit
[17:48:45] <BillCriswell> shoky: Ah, good catch.
[17:49:01] <BillCriswell> com4: That doesn't sound right.
[17:49:03] <shoky> both are good ;p
[17:49:23] <com4> BillCriswell, agreed. i'm whipping up a jsfiddle
[17:50:14] <BillCriswell> com4: http://jsbin.com/cokikifu/1/edit?html,js,output
[17:51:12] <com4> BillCriswell, I'm using 1.7.2 -- it should still work, right?
[17:51:30] <Fraz> shoky, i cant use stopPropogation as the element contains functioning links
[17:51:44] <BillCriswell> com4: YEs.
[17:51:46] <Fraz> BillCriswell, works like a charm, cheers:)
[17:51:52] <com4> BillCriswell, *sigh* i can't reproduce it.  I'll be back :)
[17:51:53] <shoky> Fraz: stopPropagation isn't preventDefault
[17:54:12] <BillCriswell> com4: Are you saving $el.val() to a variable and calling that? That wouldn't update.
[17:54:53] <com4> BillCriswell, yes. yes i am   var blah = $el.val();   then later in an ajax call blah: blah
[17:55:08] <com4> BillCriswell, i should just read it directly?
[17:55:31] <shoky> you should call .val() when it already has the new value
[17:55:58] <BillCriswell> Right right.
[17:56:04] <BillCriswell> What shoky says.
[17:58:06] <BillCriswell> shoky: You using any frameworks lately?
[17:58:22] <BillCriswell> of the javascript family.
[17:58:31] <BillCriswell> client-side
[17:58:45] <com4> BillCriswell, shoky, understood. The problem is i think i am :)
[17:59:17] <com4> The button is in a boot strap modal. Does this make a difference?
[18:00:10] <shoky> BillCriswell i'm not doing anything interesting in client-side lately, so no ;p but i'm still a knockout.js guy, if you call that a framework
[18:00:51] <shoky> you wrestling with angular docs?
[18:01:13] <shoky> i sure hated those
[18:01:37] <BillCriswell> shoky: Yeah. Things aren't clicking. I want to stick at it though for some reason.
[18:02:35] <shoky> if you despair, give KO a shot :P their docs are good and tutorials are fun
[18:03:05] <shoky> and it's not as opinionated or frameworky
[18:05:51] <BillCriswell> shoky: I have played with that a bit. A lot about it makes more sense to me.
[18:08:01] <shoky> whatcha having trouble with in angular?
[18:08:19] <shoky> i remember some bits and pieces
[18:09:22] <BillCriswell> I'm just messing around with it now. I struggle most with knowing what to use not so much how to get it to work.
[18:09:33] <BillCriswell> I just feel like I'm probably doing things wrong lol
[18:11:40] <shoky> you say that about everything :D
[18:12:39] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I could probably learn a lot just changing my attitude about it a bit.
[18:13:32] <shoky> but yeah i remember also having to dig a lot to find out the preferred way of doing some stuff, they just throw tons of info at you without much clear guidelines
[18:15:47] <BillCriswell> shoky: Yeah, exactly how I feel.
[18:16:29] <shoky> d'ya use chrome or ff to browse?
[18:17:15] <shoky> and if chrome, do you use/like the built-in new-tab page
[18:17:18] <shoky> thx
[18:17:37] <BillCriswell> Didn't notice the new tab page.
[18:17:53] <BillCriswell> It looks the same to me I think?
[18:17:53] <shoky> hm how's that
[18:18:10] <shoky> i'm just asking generally, not about anything new
[18:18:11] <BillCriswell> I browse incognito 99% of the time.
[18:18:14] <shoky> oh
[18:18:43] <BillCriswell> Is it just the 8 most visited divs and the search bar?
[18:18:51] <shoky> yeah. hate that shit
[18:19:22] <shoky> i'm thinking of making a replacement extension. don't like any of the ones i've seen
[18:19:56] <BillCriswell> What are you thinking for it?
[18:20:21] <BillCriswell> My home page is http://devdocs.io/ but I don't see how to open my home page on a new tab click oddly enough.
[18:21:15] <simpleuser> Just a question by curiosity‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôve got an effect I love on my website, something acting on a div while scrolling down. The effect is much better when the scroll is fluid and automatic (when I go to an anchor in my page). Is there a way, in JQuery, to enable the effect ONLY when the scroll is automatic, and not when the user does it him/herself?
[18:21:41] <BillCriswell> shoky: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/currently/ojhmphdkpgbibohbnpbfiefkgieacjmh?hl=en I've used this in the past.
[18:21:43] <shoky> minimal, just grouped links and maybe some widgets like rss, a few different layouts, emphasis on being highly customizable, works offline
[18:22:01] <BillCriswell> shoky: I hear that.
[18:22:04] <shoky> the extensions i've seen have some of those qualities, but i haven't seen any that has all of them
[18:22:10] <shoky> especially customizable + works offline
[18:22:40] <BillCriswell> Are these done with straight up html and css or something else?
[18:22:57] <shoky> extensions?
[18:23:07] <BillCriswell> Yeah, like that new tab page.
[18:23:26] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.
[18:23:28] <BillCriswell> I'm an idiot.
[18:23:37] <BillCriswell> Never thought to view source lol
[18:23:37] <shoky> yeah it's html,css,js and you can use chrome extension API's from js
[18:23:44] <shoky> ;]
[18:23:58] <BillCriswell> Niiice.
[18:24:22] <shoky> pretty simple shit if you can already code sites ;p
[18:24:34] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha true.
[18:24:56] <BillCriswell> Probably a lot easier since you don't have to give a shit about other browsers.
[18:25:51] <shoky> yup
[18:27:22] <BillCriswell> simpleuser: You want something to only happen when you manually scroll but not when you do like the anchor scroll thing?
[18:29:03] <simpleuser> BillCriswell: The opposite. But the principle is the same ^^
[18:30:58] <BillCriswell> simpleuser: Hmmm...
[18:31:12] <simpleuser> Yeah‚Ä¶ Good question, isn‚Äôt it ? :p
[18:32:56] <shoky> simpleuser: yes it's possible. but if you're using a specific plugin for these effects then it's highly dependent on the specific plugin and how it does shit. for example, if it's a plugin that only does things in respond to scroll events.. then the answer is no.
[18:33:19] <shoky> if you're not using any plugin.. anything's possible
[18:33:52] <simpleuser> Mmm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm using https://github.com/davist11/jQuery-One-Page-Nav for my menu, and to scroll smoothly.
[18:34:58] <shoky> what's the effect?
[18:35:47] <pzp> does the fadeIn/fadeOut effect create a "white flash" by any chance?
[18:36:09] <simpleuser> shoky: For now the effect is something like that : http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/6/
[18:38:02] <pzp> I'm using fadeIn and fadeOut simultaneously and something looks really strange
[18:38:25] <BillCriswell> pzp: In the same area?
[18:39:10] <pzp> BillCriswell: yes
[18:39:22] <pzp> On two overlapping(?) objects
[18:39:24] <BillCriswell> pzp: You might want to fadeOut, then fadeIn
[18:39:34] <BillCriswell> So in the fadeOut callback do the fadeIn
[18:39:57] <pzp> but won't that leave me with a blank area for a few hundred ms?
[18:40:26] <BillCriswell> pzp: No. Don't think so?
[18:40:42] <pzp> BillCriswell: I'll try it
[18:40:46] <pzp> can't hurt
[18:41:22] <pzp> callback is last arg, correct?
[18:42:03] <shoky> simpleuser: here's a silly example.. http://jsfiddle.net/KuDc7/8/
[18:42:31] <BillCriswell> pzp: http://jsbin.com/fasomomu/1/edit?html,js,output
[18:44:45] <blue_warlock> how can this function load anoher function
[18:44:49] <blue_warlock>  $(window).on('resize', onload).trigger('resize');
[18:45:21] <blue_warlock> i have to load a function name rightpush
[18:46:07] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: On resize you need to run two functions?
[18:46:31] <pzp> BillCriswell: shouldn't fadeOut() also hide() an object?
[18:46:55] <BillCriswell> pzp: It is I thought?
[18:47:06] <blue_warlock> yes
[18:47:12] <pzp> BillCriswell: Idk, it's coming out quite strange
[18:47:16] <simpleuser> shoky: Nice !
[18:47:19] <simpleuser> Thank you !
[18:47:38] <pzp> now the "white flash" comes after the transition
[18:47:52] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: You could do: $(window).on('resize', function () { onload(); rightpush() }).trigger('resize');
[18:47:59] <blue_warlock> BillCriswell duch said that funciton its strange =)
[18:48:09] <BillCriswell> pzp: I'd have to see.
[18:48:09] <pzp> I think I know the problem
[18:48:41] <pzp> I have to think about it for a minute or two though
[18:48:48] <pzp> I like to conceptualize the bugs
[18:49:25] <simpleuser> shoky: The only prob is if the user don‚Äôt come back to the top with a link, but manually. The circle stayed small. But I guess it‚Äôs easy to fix it. Gonna try. Thank you very much for your help :)
[18:49:37] <simpleuser> does not come*
[18:50:33] <shoky> blue_warlock duch misunderstood, he thought the .trigger('resize') was happening INSIDE the event handler
[18:50:37] <pzp> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/pzp1997/5vTW6/11/embedded/result/
[18:51:02] <pzp> I think I should fadeIn before I fadeOut
[18:51:19] <pzp> What other animations are there?
[18:57:53] <blue_warlock> =)
[18:58:50] <blue_warlock> its fantasticcccc =)
[18:59:20] <apajo> i need to specify key code and event target to jQuery.Event but somewhy when i specify them, the event wont get triggered anymore -> http://jsfiddle.net/fS7k9/3/
[19:00:08] <blue_warlock> i love JQ ! ;)
[19:00:11] <shoky> pzp well.. first of all you're setting both slides to the same image..
[19:00:22] <pzp> shoky: I noticed
[19:00:28] <pzp> but it shouldn't make a difference
[19:00:46] <shoky> big difference, but it's not the only problem
[19:00:59] <pzp> shoky: think about it though
[19:01:16] <pzp> oh I see
[19:01:21] <pzp> that's true
[19:03:33] <apajo> why cant i define values to jQuery.Event object and then trigger the "keypress" jQuery.Event ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/fS7k9/3/
[19:03:41] <shoky> also if you want crossfade then you do want the fadeIn/fadeOut to happen in parallel
[19:06:31] <pzp> shoky: that's what I had
[19:06:54] <pzp> But I was getting a strange "white flash" for the the transitions
[19:07:02] <pzp> unless its meant to look like that
[19:07:30] <oniMaker> pzp: are you taking any medications?
[19:07:49] <pzp> oniMaker: Why do you ask?
[19:08:09] <oniMaker> pzp: well you're seeing white flashes
[19:08:42] <pzp> oniMaker: shoky
[19:08:45] <pzp> whoops
[19:08:48] <pzp> http://jsfiddle.net/pzp1997/5vTW6/8/embedded/result/
[19:08:55] <pzp> thats the infamous white flash
[19:09:23] <BillCriswell> apajo: Why are you setting the target?
[19:09:26] <shoky> pzp: http://jsfiddle.net/5vTW6/13/
[19:10:31] <apajo> BillCriswell: i'm checking if the target element is textarea wich wont trigger on enter key
[19:10:54] <BillCriswell> apajo: I am confused a bit.
[19:11:23] <BillCriswell> apajo: http://jsfiddle.net/fS7k9/5/ This help?
[19:12:11] <BillCriswell> It's the event.target = this; which was not allowing to to work. Not sure what the goal was with that?
[19:12:25] <pzp> shoky: It works. But why don't you update the background of transition inside update()?
[19:12:44] <pzp> and wouldn't it make more sense to init the variables at the top?
[19:12:46] <apajo> i need to know if it's a textarea that had this trigger, so you could add multiple lines with enter key
[19:12:48] <pzp> a and b I mean
[19:13:36] <shoky> pzp: but they keep switching
[19:14:15] <shoky> one time a is $slider, another time b is $slider. cause one time you fade out $transition, another time you fade out $slider
[19:14:24] <pzp> shoky: you can reassign variables without re-initializing them
[19:14:30] <shoky> pzp and you only need to update background for one
[19:14:35] <pzp> that doesn't really matter
[19:14:39] <shoky> pzp: why would you initialize them at the top?
[19:14:43] <pzp> shoky: that's what I don't get?
[19:14:58] <shoky> pzp: the previous image is already showing, there is no need to set it again
[19:15:02] <pzp> shoky: Why wouldn't you? Your way they get reinitialized every 2 seconds
[19:15:08] <pzp> literally every 2 seconds lol
[19:15:41] <shoky> pzp: eh that's nothing you need to worry about here, but i get your point
[19:15:57] <pzp> shoky: Like I said, that doesn't matter much
[19:16:11] <pzp> I don't see how the transition background is updated though
[19:16:32] <shoky> i set $transition on page init
[19:16:42] <shoky> then update() runs, so i set $slider
[19:16:46] <shoky> so now both are set
[19:16:56] <shoky> then i do fade out and fade in, $slider is now showing the current image
[19:17:04] <pzp> Oh I see
[19:17:05] <shoky> on next update, only need to update $transition with the new image
[19:17:06] <shoky> etc.
[19:17:22] <pzp> your updating a's backgournd
[19:17:24] <pzp> *background
[19:17:27] <shoky> yeah
[19:17:28] <pzp> *youre
[19:17:32] <shoky> the next image
[19:17:34] <BillCriswell> apajo: I think you want an event listened in that case, not a special event?
[19:17:41] <BillCriswell> event listenr*
[19:18:39] <pzp> shoky: Only line I don't get is $transition.css({"background-image": "url(" + String(slides[counter++]) + ")"}).show();
[19:19:04] <pzp> What's the point of executing that at the beginning?
[19:19:26] <shoky> i assumed you prefer the first image to show on page load
[19:19:45] <shoky> also
[19:19:47] <apajo> BillCriswell: that did the work, didn't relize that the $(this) will give it the e.target value
[19:20:07] <BillCriswell> apajo: Yes. That's why I was confused. =)
[19:20:10] <shoky> the .show() was sorta-necessary because after all the first thing you do in update() is fadeOut()
[19:20:20] <shoky> doesnt make sense to fadeOut if they're both hidden
[19:21:09] <pzp> shoky: counter++ was smart
[19:21:14] <pzp> good call their
[19:21:20] <pzp> *there
[19:21:33] <shoky> pzp would've been more readable to just put 0 there and initialize counter to 1 :P
[19:22:09] <pzp> yeah probably. But this way one can theoretically change the starting point on the fly
[19:22:18] <pzp> unless you start the counter at 3
[19:22:27] <pzp> then all hope is lost
[19:22:31] <pzp> lol
[19:22:31] <shoky> heh true
[19:22:41] <apajo> BillCriswell: thanks for the quick help
[19:22:46] <BillCriswell> apajo: No problem!
[19:22:58] <pzp> shoky: actually I don't see the difference between ours
[19:23:06] <pzp> You also have the "white flash"
[19:23:35] <BillCriswell> I can't believe of all the weird ass shit I watch my girlfriend likes Ja'mie.
[19:23:50] <shoky> pzp i don't see it
[19:24:04] <shoky> just the images are not the same size so it doesn't look too great
[19:25:11] <shoky> pzp though a flash could happen if the images aren't fully loaded yet
[19:28:27] <shoky> tf is Ja'mie
[19:30:10] <BillCriswell> shoky: It's a show about a 40 year old guy dressed up as a high school girl at a grammar school in Australia.
[19:30:31] <shoky> :-O
[19:31:08] <BillCriswell> He plays it so well, it's scary.
[19:31:18] <pzp> shoky: I see. The only difference between our code is that yours either changes slider or transition while mine changes both
[19:33:48] <BillCriswell> shoky: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDLxNnQQiwU if you're curious.. which most people aren't.
[19:34:02] * blue_warlock think BillCriswell rulez ! Nod.
[19:34:30] <BillCriswell> Glad I could help.
[19:34:54] <shoky> pzp yeah i didn't see your other fiddle before, i wouldn't have bothered with the a,b stuff if i had
[19:35:21] <pzp> shoky: Yeah, I just reworked yours so you don't need it
[19:35:23] <shoky> BillCriswell i'm scared
[19:35:41] <pzp> it's funny how similar they are, yet how different the result is

[21:37:13] <VectorX> i need to store country name json on a page for a autocomplete dropdown, is there a better way of doing this ?
[21:37:18] <VectorX> beside using ajax
[22:01:14] <michelleglauser> Could anyone take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/MichelleGlauser/CR329/6/ I'm not sure how to get rid of the one blank image that shows up while swiping. Ideas?
[22:10:24] <intent> Here is the code I am using for a hovering "top" button:
[22:10:25] <intent> http://pastebin.com/1T2AjWqk
[22:10:52] <intent> I want to duplicate the code and functionality so the same type of button will do the same thing but reach a #bot anchor instead of #top
[22:11:21] <intent> I tried Duplicating the code and changing the class in the jquery but then the button doesn't even show up
[22:13:06] <intent> Ah I got it to show up, that was a cache error with the CSS
[22:13:21] <intent> But how do I reverse the code so it scrolls down to wherever the #bot anchor tag is?
[22:13:37] <jphase> intent: you need to grab the offset top for that
[22:14:18] <jphase> $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $('#bot').offset().top }, 1000);
[22:18:02] <intent> Replacing that, when I click it it does nothing
[22:18:49] <intent> jphase:         jQuery('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#bot').offset().top}, 10000);
[22:18:56] <intent> Also tried with         jQuery('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#bot').offset().top}, duration);
[22:19:41] <jphase> I have a div on my page with an id of "services" for example, and when I paste $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $('#services').offset().top }, 1000);   into my console, it scrolls just fine
[22:19:52] <intent> I also don't think I need offset in there, beacsue with the first function that makes the button fade in after scrolling offset
[22:20:10] <intent> But I am having trouble getting the button to be there withu the first function
[22:20:36] <jphase> heh, okay
[22:21:05] <intent> I am a newb at this
[22:21:16] <jphase> my example works just fine. you should check to see if you actually have a div with that id on the page and/or do some console.log stuff to see that you get the top offset
[22:21:40] <intent> I have an <a name="bot"></a>
[22:22:11] <jphase> well that's != #bot
[22:22:12] <jphase> :P
[22:25:10] <intent> Okay I changed it to a div and now the button works but it is only pushing it down to offset's height
[22:26:20] <jphase> intent: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/ZjMHL/
[22:26:58] <jphase> oh whoops - http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/ZjMHL/1/
[22:28:16] <BigBangUDR> Hello EveyOne :)
[22:28:42] <jphase> hi
[22:29:02] <jphase> intent: this is even more clear, sorry for link spamming... http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/ZjMHL/3/
[22:29:27] <jphase> granted, you'd have to set an "offset" type of param if you're working with a fixed nav or something like this
[22:36:20] <intent> Oh d'oh
[22:36:25] <intent> Thanks table nesting
[22:36:37] <intent> What a simple error :p
[22:37:31] <intent> That's working great now
[22:37:37] <intent> I do have one other question
[22:37:58] <intent> You can see the first part of my original code, starting with the line "jQuery(window).scroll(function() {
[22:38:06] <intent> here's the PB incase you closed it
[22:38:06] <intent> http://pastebin.com/1T2AjWqk
[22:38:15] <intent> That fades in the "top" button after one has scrolled
[22:38:26] <intent> But I want th e"bottom" button to always be there
[22:38:36] <intent> Yet unless i call it with that fade function it doesnt show
[22:38:46] <intent> @jphase
[22:38:55] <jphase> intent: don't hide it to begin with
[22:39:01] <jphase> make it visible and style it with css
[22:39:13] <jphase> and don't touch its visibility/opacity with jquery at all
[22:39:44] <intent> Oh right
[22:39:50] <intent> display:none
[22:40:26] <intent> I also use anchor tags for other HTML anchoring
[22:40:32] <intent> Will your code interfere with that?
[22:40:46] <intent> eg mypage.php#post12
[22:41:19] <jphase> well my code is specifically meant to use anchor tags that naturally jump to a part on the same page and make them animate
[22:41:31] <jphase> it only binds to anchors that start with id="#
[22:41:53] <intent> You mean the div?
[22:42:01] <intent> My divs don't have hashtags in the ID
[22:42:05] <intent> it's div id="name"
[22:42:26] <jphase> yeah, so... <a href="#blah">Go to blah</a>   would jump to any element with id="blah"
[22:42:28] <jphase> in my example
[22:44:10] <intent> Ah okay so it's just animating the same functionality that href="#anchor" would have anyway, it's not being called if a URL with a hashtag in it is used
[22:44:15] <intent> Do I have that right
[22:44:23] <jphase> yeah
[22:44:26] <jphase> instead of jumping it animates basically
[22:45:01] <intent> Got it
[22:45:02] <jphase> $('a[href^="#"]')  <--- that's only binding to <a> tags that have an href that start with #
[22:45:15] <intent> It's working great, thank you very much
[22:45:20] <jphase> np
[23:58:56] <Feel> How to get $(element).val() with whitespaces and saved number of lines?
